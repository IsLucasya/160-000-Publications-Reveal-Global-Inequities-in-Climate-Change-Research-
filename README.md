# The codes and datas of 160,000 Publications Reveal Global Inequities in Climate Change Research
## This datasets is a freely-accessible open-source project that supports your **ETL(Extract, Transform and Load) pipeline with Python.**
## Metadata processing：Data retrieval, screening and analysis
- Data screening：By using machine learning and natural language processing methods, the metadata obtained from WOS is screened to obtain the data needed for subsequent analysis.
- Relevant data：The data used in the data retrieval process
## Geographic-based analysis
- Author country information：Obtain the information of the author's country from the metadata.
- Research country information：Use a large language model to obtain information about the country of the research subject from the article's title and abstract.
- Analysis of the author's country and the country of study：Conduct a comparative analysis between the researching country and the country being researched.
- Analyze in literature quantity and GDP:Conduct a correlation analysis between the number of documents and GDP
- Mean impact factor and Mean cumulative citations：Analyze the citation rates and impact factors of major continents around the world
- Publication of literature—Extreme high-temperature：Study the increase in the number of people exposed to extreme temperatures in various regions around the world
- Scientific research efficiency：Calculate the scientific research efficiency of various countries around the world based on the number of researchers and the total number of research projects.
- Verify the effectiveness of deepseek in national identification:Verify the accuracy of the national data obtained through the use of large language models
## Analysis of Research Categories：Conduct a statistical analysis of the categories related to the impact, mitigation, and adaptation of climate change
