"Coastlines globally are sensitive to the effects of sea-level rise, increased coastal storminess and changes in coastal sediment supply and sediment dynamics in the Anthropocene. Coastlines are also influenced by land use change, urbanization and development of built infrastructure. These changes can affect the dynamics of coastal landforms, weaken coastal resilience and make coasts more sensitive to climate hazards. This study critically examines the properties of coastlines that contribute to coastal biophysical resilience in South Africa, highlighting their relativerates of change and dynamic behaviour in response to physical and human forcing factors. Coastal landforms can be considered as 'green infrastructure' that can buffer the effects of climate change as well as providing ecosystem and environmental services in their own right. Viewing coastal landforms as green infrastructure provides a 'nature-based solution' to mitigate against climate change impacts that can work with - not against - the natural geomorphic, sedimentary and ecological processes of coastlines. Coastal landforms can also contribute to socioecological resilience, where they provide environmental and ecosystem services. The green infrastructure approach to coastal resilience has not been well developed in South Africa but is more effective in supporting coastal sustainable development.",1

"The increasing infrastructure instability is an important issue in relation to the influences of global climate change in urban areas. A serious issue pertaining to this is the dual nature of damage triggered by events combined with climate change and natural hazards. For example, catastrophic damage could result from the combination of global warming with a great earthquake, which is a worst-case scenario. Although this worst-case scenario has rarely occurred and presents a low probability of occurrence, countermeasures must be prepared in advance based on an appropriate response and adaptation strategies. After an overview of possible infrastructural instabilities caused by global warming, methodologies are proposed placing emphasis on the increasing probability of infrastructural instability triggered by natural hazards resulting from groundwater-level (GWL) variations. These effects are expected to be particularly serious in coastal regions because of the influence of the rising sea level resulting from global warming. The influence of sea-level rises (SLR) will become apparent along with land subsidence because groundwater abstraction will become severe in coastal regions. Additionally, the probability of earthquake liquefaction increases if GWL rises in accompaniment with SLR. Using case histories, we examined the possible occurrence of these natural hazards as a result of global warming. Finally, possible countermeasures and adaptation strategies for reducing and mitigating infrastructure damage accelerated by global warming are described for each case in specific regions. In particular, special attention should be paid to adaptation strategies in coastal lowlands, which particularly suffer from the effects of land subsidence.",1
"The urgency to reply to climate change requires a governance perspective that connects multiple societal levels and sectors and involves a plurality of actors. Psychologists should take an important role in addressing the ongoing climate crisis, together with other practitioners, scholars, policymakers and citizens. This systematic review aims to show the contribution psychology has offered in the governance of climate change, illustrating how psychological scholarship is positioned in the interdisciplinary discourse on climate governance and the way psychological constructs and theories are implemented. Following the PRISMA guidelines, two electronic databases (APA PsycInfo and Scopus) were screened, and 52 publications meeting the eligibility criteria were included and thoroughly analysed. The literature at the intersection between climate governance and governance is relatively scarce, yet it covers different domains and scales of analysis. Psychological contributions are always integrated into a broader interdisciplinary discourse spanning from the environmental to the social sciences, yet a scarce theoretical specificity has been documented. We found an abundance of research on the determinants of pro-environmental behaviours, which often neglects context-grounded factors, while the relational and dynamic dimensions of governance concerning group processes and collective engagement are rarely taken into due consideration. We argue that psychologists should continue engaging in interdisciplinary collaborations to collectively craft climate solutions, especially focusing on citizenry's active engagement. Deeper theoretical elaboration on the interface between governance and psychology is needed, particularly from an ecological and systemic perspective.",0

"Trees participate in mitigating the urban heat island phenomenon thanks to their transpiration and shading. This cooling potential is highly dependent on leaf area. Nevertheless, leaf traits potentially vary across different land management practices in urban settings, thereby challenging the models used to estimate thermal budgets. The present study aims to investigate the variability of leaf area traits of linden (Tilia spp.) urban trees, and their effect on simulated tree transpiration. Reconstruction of the leaf area was undertaken at the tree scale at three different urban land management sites from three cities: London and Birmingham (UK) and Chantilly (France). The reconstruction combined allometric measurements at shoot and leaf scales, and a tree-scale 3D digitization with laboratory analysis using field data collected by citizen scientists. The management practices had a significant impact on leaf area, and on tree allometric relationships, which were propagated through the reconstruction process. Relative differences between the management practices ranged between 12% and 48% according to the city where the variable was considered (e.g., leaf area index, total leaf area, or tree transpiration). Trees in managed sites (i.e., individualized leaf crowns, frequent leaf litter removal, and standard thinning/pruning operations) develop a higher leaf area, thus promoting cooling potential. This study shows that the variability of leaf traits, and their responses to different land management, can be studied by comprehensive data collection through citizen science and lab-based modelling. It also highlights the importance of appropriate, well-designed urban planning, where landscaping using urban trees can play an even better role in climate proofing cities.",1
"Background and Purpose: Physical therapists seek to optimize movement as a means of reducing disability and improving health. The short-term effects of interventions designed to optimize movement ultimately are intended to be adapted for use across various future patterns of behavior, in potentially unpredictable ways, with varying frequency, and in the context of multiple tasks and environmental conditions. In this perspective article, we review and discuss the implications of recent evidence that optimal movement variability, which previously had been associated with adaptable motor behavior, contains a specific complex nonlinear feature known as multifractality.Summary of Key Points: Multifractal movement fluctuation patterns reflect robust physiologic interactivity occurring with in the movement system across multiple time scales. Such patterns provide conceptual support for the idea that patterns of motor behavior occurring in the moment are inextricably linked in complex, physiologic ways to patterns of motor behavior occurring over much longer periods. The human movement system appears to be particularly tuned to multifractal fluctuation patterns and exhibits the ability to reorganize its output in response to external stimulation embedded with multifractal features.Recommendations for Clinical Practice: As a fundamental feature of human movement, multifractality opens new avenues for conceptualizing the link between physiologic interactivity and adaptive capacity. Preliminary evidence supporting the positive influence of multifractal rhythmic auditory stimulation on the gait patterns of individuals with Parkinson disease is used to illustrate how physical therapy interventions might be devised to specifically target the adaptive capacity of the human movement system.",0
"Discriminative learning based denoising model trained with Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) performs well on synthesized noise. However, realistic noise can be spatial-variant, signal-dependent and a mixture of complicated noises. In this paper, we explore multiple strategies for applying an AWGN-based denoiser to realistic noise. Specifically, we trained a deep network integrating noise estimating and denoiser with mixed Gaussian (AWGN) and Random Value Impulse Noise (RVIN). To adapt the model to realistic noises, we investigated multi-channel, multi-scale and super-resolution approaches. Our preliminary results demonstrated the effectiveness of the newly-proposed noise model and adaptation strategies.",0
"Metabolic networks in biological systems are interconnected, such that malfunctioning parts can be corrected by other parts within the network, a process termed adaptive metabolism. Unlike Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) better manages its intracellular lifestyle by executing adaptive metabolism. Here, we used metabolomics and identified glutamate synthase (GltB/D) that converts glutamine to glutamate (Q -> E) as a metabolic effort used to neutralize cytoplasmic pH that is acidified while consuming host propionate carbon through the methylcitrate cycle (MCC). Methylisocitrate lyase, the last step of the MCC, is intrinsically downregulated in BCG, leading to obstruction of carbon flux toward central carbon metabolism, accumulation of MCC intermediates, and interference with GltB/D mediated neutralizing activity against propionate toxicity. Indeed, vitamin B12 mediated bypass MCC and additional supplement of glutamate led to selectively correct the phenotypic attenuation in BCG and restore the adaptive capacity of BCG to the similar level of Mtb phenotype. Collectively, a defective crosstalk between MCC and Q -> E contributes to attenuation of intracellular BCG. Furthermore, GltB/D inhibition enhances the level of propionate toxicity in Mtb. Thus, these findings revealed a new adaptive metabolism and propose GltB/D as a synergistic target to improve the antimicrobial outcomes of MCC inhibition in Mtb.",0
"Understanding the genomic basis of local adaptation is crucial to determine the potential of long-lived woody species to withstand changes in their natural environment. In the past, efforts to dissect the genomic architecture in gymnosperms species have been limited due to the absence of reference genomes. Recently, the genomes of some commercially important conifers, such as loblolly pine, have become available, allowing whole-genome studies of these species. In this study, we test for associations between 87k SNPs, obtained from whole-genome resequencing of loblolly pine individuals, and 270 environmental variables and combinations of them. We determine the geographic location of significant loci and identify their genomic location using our newly constructed ultradense 26k SNP linkage map. We found that water availability is the main climatic variable shaping local adaptation of the species, and found 821 SNPs showing significant associations with climatic variables or combinations of them based on the consistent results of three different genotype environment association methods. Our results suggest that adaptation to climate in the species might have occurred by many changes in the frequency of alleleswith moderate to small effect sizes, and bythe smaller contribution of large effect alleles in genes related to moisture deficit, temperature and precipitation. Genomic regions of low recombination and high population differentiation harbored SNPs associated with groups of environmental variables, suggesting climate adaptation might have evolved as a result of different selection pressures acting on groups of genes associated with an aspect of climate rather than on individual environmental variables.",0
"Small-scale farmers who depend on natural resources for subsistence in rural areas are especially vulnerable to climate change and may develop adaptive responses once they understand the nature of the risks and their consequences. We examine the effects of schooling, experience in agriculture, and the number and severity of risks perceived by farmers on the number and type of adaptive responses developed. Ninety-four farmers were surveyed in six rural communities in Catimbau National Park, Pernambuco, Brazil, to obtain socioeconomic data about major drought events and perceived related risks. Participants were asked to classify risks according to their severity. We argue that understanding the degree of vulnerability of social-ecological systems in semi-arid regions may facilitate actions at different scales to mitigate risks arising from climate change.",1
"To better explain why the economic systems are grey, it is necessarily to study their components and to effectively look into their pasts or predict their future. In most of the cases, when predicting their future, the uncertainty arises. First of all, the human component plays an important role due to its usually unpredicted and sometimes irrational behaviour, a situation strictly related to the way the humans are thinking and acting. From here, it is easily be demonstrated that when analysing a system we are facing with grey knowledge. This kind of knowledge exists and it represents that small piece of puzzle that succeed in filling the gap that separate the explicit knowledge form the tacit one, also conducting to incertitude. Second, it often happens that the abnormal situations or crises that may arise in the economic systems to depend on various, mostly unknown or unpredicted, environmental conditions, including here turbulences. Moreover, when focusing specifically on firms as parts of the economic systems, this grey situation becomes even more noticeable. Firms - complex adaptive systems by nature - possess one of the most important sources of uncertainty that derives directly from their highly adaptive capacity. That is why, when analysing the economic systems, in general, or their sub-systems, in particular, the applying of the grey systems theory methods becomes a very good alternative to the already consecrated methods. To support this idea, some of the most well-known and well-used methods in the economic systems treatment (including grey systems theory) are presented along with their main advantages and disadvantages. Also, a case study is illustrated, showing how we can combine these theories in order to achieve better results.",0
"Cultural landscapes reflect a cultural group's continuous and evolved interactions with natural resources and the environment. By now, climate change has become the most significant threat to cultural landscapes, e.g., food security, water scarcity, and displacement. The cultural and natural heritage of cultural landscapes can enhance their value as integrated systems and offer solutions to the challenges brought by climate change. Although exploring tangible impacts of climate change has received sufficient attention in cultural landscapes, a systematic understanding of the main barriers has been overlooked in building climate resilience in cultural landscapes. This paper aimed to explore the main barriers to building climate resilience in cultural landscapes. The research methodology was based on the content analysis of 359 documents published between 1995 and 2020. The results revealed that the integrated approach in documentation and assessments was the most quoted technical barrier. In addition, the lack of a regulatory framework for supporting effective collaboration and cooperation has been discussed as the most significant institutional obstacle to climate resilience in cultural landscapes.",1
"NOVELTY - The method involves extracting the feature through the multi-layer convolution neural network (CNN) by an encoder portion. The decoder portion gradually recovers the feature image through the up-sampling and convolution layer to finally generate the prediction result. The multi-scale attention mechanism module is introduced based on the U-Net framework. The module captures the features under different scales and endow the important features with higher weight so as to obviously improve the recognition ability of the model. The model training is performed by integrating the ocean surface latent heat flux data from multiple data sources. The model learns more abundant and comprehensive characteristics by fusing the multi-source data. The adaptive capacity to different environments and conditions is improved, and the prediction performance is enhanced.

"Coastal tourism and beach resorts are considered the most vulnerable tourism activities to climate change. This paper seeks to achieve two objectives: first, to examine climate change's impact on the value of tourists' experience in coastal tourism and beach resorts; Secondly, to identify the adaptation strategies applied to coastal tourism and beach resort hotels to reduce the negative effects of climate changes. A quantitative approach was adopted in this research to test the study hypotheses. Hurghada was selected as a case study. A convenience sample technique was chosen in this research to collect data from visitors of coastal tourism and beach resort hotel guests. A total of 250 questionnaires were distributed, and only 175 were returned and valid for analysis with a response rate of 70%. The findings showed that coastal tourism and beach resort hotels on the Red Sea are highly vulnerable to potential climate change risks such as floods, rising sea levels and rising temperatures. Also, the findings showed that climate changes negatively affect coastal tourism and beach resort hotels, affecting the value of the tourist experience. In addition, the results indicated that coastal tourism and beach resort hotels on the Red Sea coast in Hurghada are exposed to significant financial losses due to the threats of climate change. Beach resort hotels must be able to adapt to climate changes and mitigate their effects.",0
"This paper suggests a two-tiered climate insurance strategy that would support developing country adaptation to the risks of climate variability and meet the intent of Article 4.8 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The core of this strategy is the establishment of a climate insurance programme specialized in supporting developing country insurance-related initiatives for sudden- and slow-onset weather-related disasters. This programme could take many institutional forms, including an independent facility, a facility in partnership with other institutions of the donor community, or as part of a multi-purpose disaster management facility operated outside of the climate regime. Its main purpose would be to enable the establishment of public-private safety nets for climate-related shocks by assisting the development of (sometimes novel) insurance-related instruments that are affordable to the poor and coupled with actions and incentives for pro-active preventive measures. A second tier could provide disaster relief contingent on countries making credible efforts to manage their risks. Since it would be based on precedents of donor-supported insurance systems in developing countries, a main advantage of this proposed climate insurance strategy is its demonstrated feasibility. Other advantages include its potential for linking with related donor initiatives, providing incentives for loss reduction and targeting the most vulnerable. Many details and issues are left unresolved, and it is hoped that this suggested strategy will facilitate needed discussion on practical options for supporting adaptation to climate change in developing countries.",1

"Range distributions for many animal species across North America are shifting, many in directions consistent with anthropogenic climate change over the last century. Assuming climate change continues to act as a driver for geographic range shifts, theoretical northern range shift movements can be calculated using a bioclimatic envelope approach that assume the need to maintain current temperatures and determine whether these would be attainable given projected temperature changes over the coming century. We focus on historically present small mammals in northern Indiana whose range shifts from their 1930s capture locations are attributed to be a hypothetical response to changes in recorded and projected average January temperature from 1914-1944 to 1961-1990, 2020-2049, and 2070-2099. Over the mid-20th century, the theoretical distance a mammal must move to remain at the same temperature (temperature-maintaining distance, TMD) ranged from 18.6 to 97.3 km (0.40-2.07 km/year) and appears to have been attainable. However, based on future temperature changes projected under the SRES higher (A1FI) and lower (B1) emissions scenarios, we found significantly larger increases in TMDs by both mid- and end-of-century relative to the historical period. Given recognized barriers to northern range extension, future small mammal TMDs greater than 4 km/year in some scenarios appear less viable than those experienced in the past in this region. As differences between higher and lower emissions scenarios may ultimately influence the ability of mammals to move TMDs, particularly by the end of the century, future emissions have the potential to markedly affect the resulting range shifts.

"Sorghum is a climate-resilient crop critical to livelihood in several semi-arid regions but has tradition-ally received limited research investment. In depth bibliometric analysis covering years 2000 -2020 was performed using Scopus database to gain insight on sorghum research trends and identify gaps and opportunities for the crop. 17,720 relevant documents were retrieved and analysed. Robust increase in research literature on sorghum was observed for the period, more than tripling to almost 1,600/year in 2020. New opportunities stimulated by the sorghum genome sequencing and evolution of the crop as a model for drought tolerance, and growing recognition of sorghum as a potential food and energy security crop in response to climate change were key drivers of research output. Encourag-ing evidence demonstrates that both sorghum yield and nutritional quality are more stable to climate change compared to major cereal crops like maize and rice. End use trends suggest sorghum is more competitive in the food market than feed and bioenergy markets that have dominated its production in the past. Quality traits identified as most likely to expand long-term sorghum food value chain include endosperm functionality (kafirin protein properties), health (resistant starch and polyphenols), and nutrition (iron and zinc). Gene editing technology has shown promise as a tool to efficiently design sorghums with traits for high value food applications. Increased investment in market-driven sorghum improvement research targeting traits that address long-term consumer food needs will ben-efit both global food security and the environment.(c) 2022 SAAB.

"Cropping system diversification of cereal-cereal systems with alternative systems preferably with pulses/legumes is demand of time across the globe for sustenance of natural resources and climate resilience. Rice-chickpea has been advocated as a futuristic cropping system in rice ecologies of South Asia for diversification of dominating rice-wheat system. However, the long-term sustainability of this system with respect to weed severity/growth, crop/system productivity, profitability, and yield stability under variable tillage, crop residues, and weed management practices has not been studied elaborately. Hence, present study was undertaken for five consecutive years in split-plot design with four tillage and residue management practices in main plot (conventional and zero tillage with and without residues), and three weed control practices (pre + post emergence herbicides and manual weeding) in sub-plot. Conservation tillage system comprising zero-tilled (ZT) direct seeded rice (ZTDSR) - ZT chickpea with rice residue retention (ZTDSR-ZTC+RR) led to the lower weed density in chickpea (by 10 %) and system (by 7 %) than conventional-tilled (CT) puddled transplanted rice - CT chickpea without residues (PTR-CTC-R; farmer practice). Among weed management practices, pendimethalin 1 kg a.i. ha-1 - metsulfuron-methyl + chlorimuron ethyl (ready-mix) 4 g a.i. ha-1 in rice and oxyfluorfen 150 g a.i. ha-1 - propaquizafop 100 g a.i. ha-1 in chickpea decreased the weed density in system by 14-22 % (p < 0.05) than pendimethalin + one hand weeding. The best weed management practice (pendimethalin - metsulfuron-methyl + chlorimuron ethyl) had significantly total weed density rice (by 7 %) and system (by 10 %) than current recommendation of the Indo-Gangetic Plains region (pendimethalin - bispyribac-sodium). It suggested that rotation of bispyribac-sodium with metsulfuron-methyl+chlorimuron ethyl (mixture herbicide) could reduce weed density and increase yield over time. Mean of five years indicated a non-significant yield difference among conservation and conventional tillage systems in rice. However, conservation tillage practice (ZTDSR-ZTC+RR) had 10 % higher chickpea yield and 4 % higher system yield (five years mean) over the PTR-CTC-R (p < 0.05). Further, conservation tillage comprising ZT in both crops in system with added residues (ZTDSR-ZTC+RR) resulted in an economic benefit of INR 22,000 than the conventional tillage in both crops without residues (PTRCTC-R). Moreover, five years sustainable yield index was 16 % higher in ZTDSR-ZTC+RR system than conventional-tilled rice-chickpea system. Thus, conservation tillage with suitable pre- + post- emergence herbicides such as pendimethalin - metsulfuron-methyl + chlorimuron ethyl in rice and oxyfluorfen - propaquizafop in chickpea can reduce the weed density and enhance the crop and system productivity over time than conventional tillage. This system can also sustain the yields of component crops and system in long-run with higher yield stability over conventional tillage without residues. This system can be adopted in the cereal-cereal based cropping system of rice ecologies to diversify the system and to reverse the weed infestation and yield decline.",1
"Climate change is one of the major challenges in watershed management systems. Rising air temperatures, increasing precipitation in winter, and decreasing precipitation in summer as well as increases in extreme weather events have increased flooding and droughts and further affected water quality in the Miyun Reservoir Watershed (MRW). This study used the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model with five downscaled general circulation models (GCMs) to quantify the impact of climate change on hydrology, soil erosion, nutrient cycling, and the performance of Best Management Practices (BMPs) at watershed scale, driven by RCPs 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5. Compared with the baseline scenario, the results indicated that climate variability, especially precipitation and temperature, had great effects on surface runoff, sediment yields, and nutrient losses and further significantly affected BMP efficiency, although the magnitudes of change differed among the RCPs. Monthly sediment and nutrient loads increased substantially in all climate change scenarios, especially in flood season, due to the increase in precipitation intensity. Although BMPs were identified to be not appreciably effective in controlling water balance, they were effective in reducing sediment and nutrient losses. Based on this case, a simulation-optimization framework was applied to develop future watershed management strategies with BMP configurations because of their climate adaptation benefits, water improvement targets, and economical cost. The results indicated that the discrepancy among different climate scenarios was reflected by the number and types of BMPs and their spatial distributions, especially structural BMPs. This study suggests that the increasing frequency of rainfall events may decrease the efficiency of BMPs in the MRW, and watershed management should be adjusted according to changing climate in the future.",1
"The global decline of coral reefs heightens the need to understand how corals may persist under changing environmental conditions. Restructuring of the coral-associated bacterial community, either through natural or assisted strategies, has been suggested as a means of adaptation to climate change. A low complexity microbial system would facilitate testing the efficacy of microbial restructuring strategies. We used the model organism for corals, Exaiptasia diaphana, and determined that short-term (3 weeks) exposure to filter-sterilized seawater conditions alone reduced the complexity of the microbiome. Metabarcoding of the V5-V6 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene revealed that alpha diversity was approximately halved in anemones reared in filtersterilized seawater compared to controls reared in unfiltered seawater and that the composition (beta diversity) differed significantly between the two. By reducing the complexity of the E. diaphana microbiome, the development of a system for testing assisted strategies such as probiotics, is more feasible.",1
"Crop wild relatives (CWR) are valuable gene pools for crop improvement and offer unique potential and opportunity for enhancing food security and adaptation to climate change. However, current actions towards conservation of plant genetic resources in Zambia do not adequately cover CWR occurring in the country. The article describes the process leading to the development of a national strategic action plan (NSAP) for the conservation and sustainable use of priority CWR in Zambia. Based on 59 prioritized crops, a partial checklist of 459 CWR taxa was generated from the national flora checklist of 6305 taxa. The generated CWR taxa were prioritized based on the socio-economic value of the related crop, their utilization potential in crop improvement, relative distribution and threat status to produce 30 prioritized CWR taxa. Occurrence data were compiled for all CWR inventory taxa and used in spatial analyses to establish species distribution, species richness, gaps in in situ conservation and genebank collections, and to identify priority sites for in situ conservation and ex situ collecting. Consistent with the national developmental agenda, along with the contribution of national stakeholders, spatial analyses of occurrence data of priority CWR taxa are valuable input for the development of the NSAP for the conservation and sustainable use of the priority CWR.",1
"Climate change and trade are closely related. Climate may alter the comparative advantages across countries, which may in turn trigger changes in trade patterns. Trade itself may constitute an adaptation strategy, moving excesses of agri-food supply to regions with shortages, and this in turn may explain changes in land-use. We investigate these linkages, showing that the changes in climate affect counties' trade value and contribute to reshaping trade patterns. First, we quantify the long-term impacts of climate on the value of agri-food exports, implicitly considering the ability of countries to adapt, and show that higher marginal temperatures and rainfall levels tend to be beneficial for countries' exports. Following a gravity model approach, we then link the evolving trade patterns to climate change adaptation strategies. We find that the larger the difference in temperatures and rainfall levels between trading partners, the higher the value of bilateral exports. Furthermore, while developed and developing exporters are both sensitive to climate change and to cross-countries heterogeneity in climate, we found their responses to changes in climate to be quite diverse.",1
"This study evaluated the potential of microalgae Scenedesmus abundance for pretreatment of pharmaceutical wastewater in photobioreactor (PBR) associated with photosynthetic microbial fuel cell (PMFC). At the end of pretreatment process, the removal efficiency of COD of 75 % along with nitrate and phosphate of 78 and 83 % was obtained, respectively. In continuation of treatment process, the pretreated wastewater was used as a substrate for further treatment in PMFC and was succeeded to achieve maximum COD removal of 87.8 % calculating the total (combined of PBR and PMFC) removal efficiency of 95 %. A maximum voltage of 740.13 mV and power density of 838.68 mW/m(2) was achieved. A maximum biomass of 0.71 g/L from PBR after pretreatment and 0.78 g/L from PMFC process was obtained.",0
"With modern industrialization and urbanization, air pollution has become a significant environmental problem in urban areas. The effective removal of air pollutants is crucial for improving air quality, maintaining human health, and achieving human well-being. As the most densely populated city in Taiwan, Taipei City faces a severe fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure problem. This study proposes a conceptual framework in response to urban PM2.5 pollution that adversely affects human health. The PM2.5 removal capacity provided by urban vegetation within Taipei City was first quantified, and its public health benefits were then evaluated. The optimal locations for different nature-based solutions (NBS) were also identified, which could be applied when forming urban PM2.5 pollution mitigation policies. The results revealed that the urban vegetation of Taipei City in 2016 contributed to reducing the health incidence change of premature death and certain diseases, equated monetarily to New Taiwan Dollar (NT$) 9.43E+08. In addition, as one of the four evaluated NBS, direct vertical greening presented with the highest benefit-cost ratio for Taipei City. Spatial mappings of the different NBS locations could guide the government in planning sustainable urban green infrastructure in the future.",1
"The investigation was carried out to determine the stability and adaptability patterns of a set of ten released and commercial varieties of lemongrass (released by CIMAP. Lucknow), for commercial cultivation in different part/environments, namely. Pragati. Krishna, Cauvery. Nima, YEL-1, LMH-4 of Cymbopogon flaxuosus, Praman (Cymbopogon pendulus), T-1 (Cymbopogon citratus), CIMAP Suwarana and parent-1 (Cymbopogon khasianus) in a multi-year evaluation trial across three consecutive years. Among the objectives of multiyear essential oil yield field trials are the establishment of adaptation strategies for breeding programs and definition of domains for variety recommendations in lemongrass varieties. The adaptation strategy objectives focuses on responses of a set of varieties to obtain indications and generate predictions relative to future breeding material that may be produced from the genetic base of which the tested genotypes/varieties are assumed to be a representative sample, while, for cultivar recommendation the most important information concern the response of, and comparison between, high yielding varieties. Yield stability is one of the setback facing plant breeders in using/developing widely adapted varieties with superior yield of better quality. Based on the stability statistics, the different varieties can be classified as stable variety. The multivariate approach AMMI model (more authentic approach than univariate approach), have capability to provide a broader inferences on adaptability. Based on the AMMI model, varieties CIMAP Suwarna, showed the widest adaptability (most stable varieties) due to its ability to tolerate wide environmental conditions, temperature/or abiotic stress in different years/environments.

"Cities are at the forefront of the climate change issue and are responsible for about 39% of global carbon dioxide emissions. They can form their own climate which is often characterized by higher temperatures and pollution levels, less wind, and solar access compared to their surroundings. This paper presents a systematic review of publications on cities in cold and polar climate regions as defined by the Kodppen-Geiger climate classification to determine the most-researched topics, identify sparsely incorporated research areas, synthesize research evidence and summarize the most important results. In total, 101 papers have been included, categorized, and analyzed according to their publication year, country, climate, topic, method, keywords, citations, and publication channels. The articles were classified into nine main topics: urban heat island (UHI) magnitude, UHI mitigation, other UHI related, biometeorology, air pollution, urban boundary layer and atmospheric boundary layer, time series analysis, other urban meteorological phenomena, and research not falling under the previous eight categories. The most-covered topic was the UHI effect. The outweighing part of studies used on-site measurements for obtaining data, while some studies were dedicated to understanding the structure, or the temporal and spatial variability of the UHI, often by using numerical tools. The review reveals significant gaps in the research of microclimatic characteristics and physical properties of the materials in urban design. Ongoing climate change and the particular vulnerability of cold and polar climate regions makes it especially important to review, develop, and adopt climate adaption and mitigation strategies for sustainable urban development.",1

"The adoption of climate-smart irrigation technologies amongst smallholder farmers generally remains low beside their role in combating food and nutrition security in a society and in climate change adaptation strategies. This study identified the factors influencing smallholder farmers' decision to adopt Climate Smart Irrigation Technologies (CSIT) in the Limpopo Province of South Africa. Data were collected through the completion of a face-to-face structured questionnaire by 100 smallholder farmers selected through convenience and purposive sampling. A probit regression and OLS model were used to identify factors that influence the smallholder farmer's decision to adopt CSIT and the level of adoption. The results indicated that only 46% of the smallholder farmers adopted climate-smart irrigation technologies and suggested that adoption is influenced positively by factors such as gender, age, district, farm size, staple food production and knowledge on CSIT. There is an urgent need for related stakeholders to transform the smallholder farmer subsector through improved extension services, training, adopting resilient crop varieties, promoting underutilized and nutrient-dense crops adapted to harsh local conditions, and other interventions. This should be done by promoting awareness to smallholder farmers regarding these interventions and new technologies that have the potential to improve rural livelihoods and enhance resilience and adaptation.",1
"The benefits of urban green and blue infrastructure (UGI) are widely discussed, but rarely take into account local conditions or contexts. Although assessments increasingly consider the demand for the ecosystem services that UGI provides, they tend to only map the spatial pattern of pressures such as heat, or air pollution, and lack a wider understanding of where the beneficiaries are located and who will benefit most. We assess UGI in five cities from four continents with contrasting climate, socio-political context, and size. For three example services (air pollution removal, heat mitigation, accessible greenspace), we run an assessment that takes into account spatial patterns in the socio-economic demand for ecosystem services and develops metrics that reflect local context, drawing on the principles of vulnerability assessment. Despite similar overall levels of UGI (from 35 to 50% of urban footprint), the amount of service provided differs substantially between cities. Aggregate cooling ranged from 0.44 degrees C (Leicester) to 0.98 degrees C (Medellin), while pollution removal ranged from 488 kg PM2.5/yr (Zomba) to 48,400 kg PM2.5/yr (Dhaka). Percentage population with access to nearby greenspace ranged from 82% (Dhaka) to 100% (Zomba). The spatial patterns of pressure, of ecosystem service, and of maximum benefit within a city do not necessarily match, and this has implications for planning optimum locations for UGI in cities.(c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

"Plants have evolved the adaptive capacity to mitigate the negative effect of external adversities at chemical, molecular, cellular, and physiological levels. This capacity is conferred by triggering the coordinated action of internal regulatory factors, in which sugars play an essential role in the regulating chloroplast degradation and leaf senescence under various stresses. In this review, we summarize the recent findings on the senescentassociated changes in carbohydrate metabolism and its relation to chlorophyl degradation, oxidative damage, photosynthesis inhibition, programmed cell death (PCD), and sink-source relation as affected by abiotic stresses. The action of sugar signaling in regulating the initiation and progression of leaf senescence under abiotic stresses involves interactions with various plant hormones, reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst, and protein kinases. This discussion aims to elucidate the complex regulatory network and molecular mechanisms that underline sugarinduced leaf senescence in response to various abiotic stresses. The imperative role of sugar signaling in regulating plant stress responses potentially enables the production of crop plants with modified sugar metabolism. This, in turn, may facilitate the engineering of plants with improved stress responses, optimal life span and higher yield achievement.",0
"The governance of urban forests as nature-based solutions (UF-NBS) in cities presents numerous challenges for public officials as different socio-cultural, environmental, political, and economic priorities must be bridged. In this context, co-production emerges as a collaborative approach that brings together stakeholders from various sectors to generate new knowledge and address challenges at the intersection of policy, practice, and research. This study aims to investigate the experiences and perspectives of public officials involved in the design, implementation, and governance of co-production for UF-NBS. Based on 22 semi-structured interviews conducted in seven European cities, we show that public officials generally have a positive perception of applying co-production in the context of UF-NBS and express willingness to adopt the approach in the future. Meanwhile, the findings also point to important lessons such as professional facilitation, early participation, participation in networks, institutionalised planning, and the use of platforms for knowledge exchange for successfully exercising UF-NBS co-production.",1
"The Midwestern United States experienced a devastating drought in 2012, leading to reduced corn and soybean yields and increased instances of pests and disease. Climate change induced weather variability and extremes are expected to increase in the future, and have and will continue to impact the agricultural sector. This study investigated how agricultural trade publications portrayed the 2012 U.S. Midwestern drought, whether climate change was associated with drought, and whether these publications laid out transformative adaptation measures farmers could undertake in order to increase their adaptive capacity for future climate uncertainty. We performed a content analysis of 1000 media reports between April 1, 2012 and March 31, 2014, sampled from ten agricultural trade publications. The results lead us to suggest that trade publications' 2012 U.S. Midwestern drought discussion lacked information that would allow farmers and agricultural advisors to assess climate change risk and subsequent potential adaptive management strategies. Agricultural risk from climate change is very real, and farmers will need to adapt. The agricultural trade publications studied missed an opportunity to convey risk from climate change and the transformative adaptation practices necessary for a sustainable and resilient agricultural system.

"When natural hazards interact in compound events, they may reinforce each other. This is a concern today and in light of climate change. In the case of coastal flooding, sea-level variability due to tides, seasonal to inter-annual salinity and temperature variations, or larger-scale wind conditions modify the development and ramifications of extreme sea levels. Here, we explore how various prior conditions could have influenced peak water levels for the devastating coastal flooding event in the western Baltic Sea in 1872. We design numerical experiments by imposing a range of precondition circumstances as boundary conditions to numerical ocean model simulations. This allows us to quantify the changes in peak water levels that arise due to alternative preconditioning of the sea level before the storm surge. Our results show that certain preconditioning could have generated even more catastrophic impacts. As an example, a simulated increase in the water level of 36 cm compared to the 1872 event occurred in Koge just south of Copenhagen (Denmark) and surrounding areas - a region that was already severely impacted. The increased water levels caused by the alternative sea-level patterns propagate as long waves until encountering shallow and narrow straits, and after that, the effect vastly decreases. Adding artificial increases in wind speeds to each study point location reveals a near-linear relationship with peak water levels for all western Baltic locations, highlighting the need for good assessments of future wind extremes. Our research indicates that a more hybrid approach to analysing compound events and readjusting our present warning system to a more contextualised framework might provide a firmer foundation for climate adaptation and disaster risk management. In particular, accentuating the importance of compound preconditioning effects on the outcome of natural hazards may avoid under- or overestimation of the associated risks.",1

"With the help of the systematic review method of 118 papers, we challenge the common assumption regarding the climate information services (CIS) design and features and its role in adaptation response. The review highlights the key consideration and recommendations for future researchers, particularly CIS applicability in adaptation. (1) Most research concentrated on transmitting daily, monthly, and seasonal predictions instead of forecast visualization and co-production. It might make the difference between seasonal and near-term projections unclear to farmers and researchers; (2) The forecast's probabilistic nature is not the only source of uncertainty; studies have neglected to elicit other factors, such as the social and physiological effects of incorrect forecasts, the lack of data on various factors influencing extreme weather events, farmers' inability to decipher the information, and variations in the local language; (3) Considerable research is on forecast accuracy, skills, and the lead time but side-lined the association of these variables with different types of forecasts at different farming cycles; (4) There is limited reporting on the accessibility of climate services according to sociodemographic variables and forecast values; (5) More research highlights the impact of CIS on adaptation activity at various timelines and crop seasons, but limited ex-ante evaluations cannot uncover deficiencies in agricultural practices and information transmission. The investigations were predominately ex-post evaluations, but there was little proof of how much decisions differed between experimental and control groups.",1
"Background: The World Health Organization identified climate change as the 21st century's biggest health threat. This study aimed to identify the current knowledge base, evidence gaps, and implications for climate action and health policymaking to address the health impact of climate change, including in the most underserved groups. Methods: The Horizon-funded project ENBEL ('Enhancing Belmont Research Action to support EU policy making on climate change and health') organised a workshop at the 2021-European Public Health conference. Following presentations of mitigation and adaptation strategies, seven international researchers and public health experts participated in a panel discussion linking climate change and health. Two researchers transcribed and thematically analysed the panel discussion recording. Results: Four themes were identified: (1) 'Evidence is key' in leading the climate debate, (2) the need for 'messaging about health for policymaking and behaviour change' including health co-benefits of climate action, (3) existing 'inequalities between and within countries', and (4) 'insufficient resources and funding' to implement national health adaptation plans and facilitate evidence generation and climate action, particularly in vulnerable populations. Conclusion: More capacity is needed to monitor health effects and inequities, evaluate adaptation and mitigation interventions, address current under-representations of low- or middle-income countries, and translate research into effective policymaking.",1
"Agricultural bioenergy production is subject to dynamics such as yield fluctuations, volatile prices, resource competition, new regulation and policy, innovation and climate change. This raises questions, to what extent bioenergy production is able to adapt to changes and overcome critical events. These dynamics have important implications for effective policy development. Using a case study method, which draws on various data sources, we investigate in detail how agricultural bioenergy sectors in the German State of Brandenburg adapted to diverse past events. The case analysis rests on the adaptive-cycle concept and the system properties potential, connectedness and resilience as defined by Holling and Gunderson (2002a). Our case study concludes that Brandenburg's biogas sector has a low potential and connectedness within the system, and a low resilience against crop failures. The biofuels sector displays similar properties in the short term. In the medium term the potential could increase in both sectors. The properties imply risks and opportunities for biogas production and the possibility to develop towards a stage with a higher potential and a higher connectedness. But adaptive capacity is limited and there are certain barriers for the agricultural bioenergy sectors to overcome potentially critical states. Policy needs to be tailored accordingly.

"This article explores the ways in which class structure in agrarian societies shape local adaptation responses to the impact of climate change, based on an empirical study of a village society in western Maharashtra, India. It draws on two types of fieldwork data, quantitative and qualitative, including a round of household socio-economic survey questionnaire and qualitative semi-structured interviews. We show that climate-change adaptation is class specific and varies considerably amongst the different classes within the relations of production even in the same village. The local class structure shape ownership and access to natural resources, with implications for both individual adaptive capacities and attempts to organize adaptation practices at the community-level. Specifically, adaptive practice is revealed as being largely contingent on the size of land owned and livelihood options that affects, in turn, households' adaptation capacities and their experiences of climate change. We find that whilst the village inhabitants have initiated various adaptation strategies privately, no community-based adaptation practices could be identified. As such, we call for a more comprehensive understanding of the class nature of climate change for developing effective climate adaptation strategies at the village-community level and especially for community-based adaptation (CBA) models.",0
"The combination of human exposure, extreme weather events and lack of adaptation strategies to cope with flood-related impacts can potentially increase losses not only on infrastructure but also on human lives. These impacts are usually difficult to quantify due to the lack of data, and for this reason most of the studies developed at the national scale only include the main characteristics that define the societal or individual predisposition to be affected, resist, adapt or recover, when exposed to a flood.The main objective of this work was to develop a flood social susceptibility index for the continental Portuguese territory based on the most representative variables able to characterize different influencing factors. This index is a component of the national vulnerability index developed in the scope of Flood Maps in Climate Change Scenarios (CIRAC) project, supported by the Portuguese Association of Insurers (APS).The main results showed that the proposed index correctly identified populations less prepared to avoid flood effects or able to cope with them, mostly concentrated in rural inland areas with lower income and education levels when compared with the coastal region between Viana do Castelo and Setubal.",1
"The city of Copenhagen currently pursues a very ambitious plan to make the city cloudburst proof' within the next 30 years. The cloudburst management plan has the potential to support the city's aim to become more green, liveable, and sustainable. In this study, we assessed stormwater system designs using the Three Point Approach (3PA) as a framework, where an indicator value for each domain was calculated using state-of-the-art modelling techniques. We demonstrated the methodology on scenarios representing sequential enhancements of the cloudburst management plan for a district that has been appointed to become the first climate resilient neighbourhood in Copenhagen. The results show that if the cloudburst system is exploited to discharge runoff from selected areas that are disconnected from the combined sewer system, then the plan leads to multiple benefits. These include improved flood protection under a 100-years storm (i.e., compliance with the new demands in domain C of the 3PA), reduced surcharge to terrain under a 10-years storm (i.e., compliance with the service goal in domain B of the 3PA) and an improved yearly water balance (i.e., better performance in domain A of the 3PA).",1
Siblings in civil assessment. - The article examines the adaptation strategies developed by siblings when confronted to the separation of their parents and more specifically in situations in which the conflict requires the report of an expert. In the first pan we shall expose the analysis made by different authors on the functions fulfilled by the sub-system called siblings. In the second part we shall deal with the impact of parental separation on the siblings basing our judgment on several clinical cases dealt with by civil experts. Does this kind of ordeal always make the siblings stronger as many authors believe ? How can we explain the opposite situation in which the siblings split up and which point of view can the expert adopt then ? We shall also introduce the notion of benefit to the siblings compared to that of benefit to the child. Finally we shall focus on the problems due to a split-up of the siblings and on several guidelines for the expert to follow.,0
"Well-being is a critical element of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals. Given the complexity of the concept of well-being, it follows that its measurement requires complex, multivariate methods that can characterize the physical, economic, social and environmental aspects along with the mental state of a city. Although it is not sufficient to carry out settlement-level analyses to make cities inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. It is necessary to understand patterns within settlements. This work aims to present how the urban macrostructure of urban well-being indicators can be estimated based on GIS-based multilayer analysis. Opensource data, e.g. road networks, points of interest, green spaces and vegetation, are used to estimate urban well-being parameters such as noise levels, air quality and health-related impacts supplemented by climate models to assess urban resilience and sustainability. The proposed methodology integrates 24 models into six categories, namely walkability, environment, health, society, climate change and safety, which are weighted based on a multilevel Principal Component Analysis to minimize information loss for aggregated composite indicators. The study revealed two main components of the macrostructure related to well-being in the studied city: one related to the geometrical features and the other can be derived from the structure of the natural environment. In Veszprem a natural restoration of the detached house area, industrial area and downtown is recommended including developments with green and blue infrastructural elements and nature-based solutions.",1
"Purpose - Coastal and floodplain areas are on the frontline of climate change in Bangladesh. Small-scale coastal and floodplain fishing communities of the country face a host of cross-scale stressors continually, some induced by climate change, and they have developed coping and adaption strategies based on customary social and experiential learnings. This paper aims to examine the coping and adaptation strategies that small-scale fishing communities undertake in the face of stresses including climate change and variability.Design/methodology/approach - This research takes a nuanced ethnographic-oriented approach based on around two-year-long field study in two coastal and floodplain fishing villages, represented by two distinct ethnic groups. The study adopts direct observational methods to denote the ways small-scale fishing communities address the arrays of stressors to construct and reconstruct their survival and livelihood needs.Findings - It was observed that fishers' coping and adaptation strategies comprise a fluid combination of complex overlapping sets of actions that the households undertake based on their capitals and capabilities, perceptions, socio-cultural embeddedness and experiential learnings from earlier adverse situations. Broadly, these are survival, economic, physiological, social, institutional and religiosity-psychological in nature. Adaptation mechanisms involve some implicit principles or self-provisioning actions that households are compelled to do or choose under given sets of abnormal stresses to reach certain levels of livelihood functions.Originality/value - Based on empirical field research, this paper recognizes small-scale fishers' capability and adaptability in addressing climate change-induced stresses. Policymakers, international development planners, climate scientists and social workers can learn from these grassroots-level coping and adaptation strategies of fishing communities to minimize the adverse effects of climate change and variations.",1
"In this study, meteorological time series from five meteorological stations in and around a watershed in Turkey were used in the statistical downscaling of global climate model results to be used for future projections. Two general circulation models (GCMs), Canadian Climate Center (CGCM3.1(T63)) and Met Office Hadley Centre (2012) (HadCM3) models, were used with three Special Report Emission Scenarios, A1B, A2, and B2. The statistical downscaling model SDSM was used for the downscaling. The downscaled ensembles were put to validation with GCM predictors against observations using nonparametric statistical tests. The two most important meteorological variables, temperature and precipitation, passed validation statistics, and partial validation was achieved with other time series relevant in hydrological studies, namely, cloudiness, relative humidity, and wind velocity. Heat waves, number of dry days, length of dry and wet spells, and maximum precipitation were derived from the primary time series as annual series. The change in monthly predictor sets used in constructing the multiple regression equations for downscaling was examined over the watershed and over the months in a year. Projections between 1962 and 2100 showed that temperatures and dryness indicators show increasing trends while precipitation, relative humidity, and cloudiness tend to decrease. The spatial changes over the watershed and monthly temporal changes revealed that the western parts of the watershed where water is produced for subsequent downstream use will get drier than the rest and the precipitation distribution over the year will shift. Temperatures showed increasing trends over the whole watershed unparalleled with another period in history. The results emphasize the necessity of mitigation efforts to combat climate change on local and global scales and the introduction of adaptation strategies for the region under study which was shown to be vulnerable to climate change.",1
"Aim: Ecosystems face numerous well-documented threats from climate change. The well-being of people also is threatened by climate change, most prominently by reduced food security. Human adaptation to food scarcity, including shifting agricultural zones, will create new threats for natural ecosystems. We investigated how shifts in crop suitability because of climate change may overlap currently protected areas (PAs) and priority sites for PA expansion in South Africa. Predicting the locations of suitable climate conditions for crop growth will assist conservationists and decision-makers in planning for climate change.Location: South Africa.Methods: We modelled climatic suitability in 2055 for maize and wheat cultivation, two extensively planted, staple crops, and overlaid projected changes with PAs and PA expansion priorities.Results: Changes in winter climate could make an additional 2 million ha of land suitable for wheat cultivation, while changes in summer climate could expand maize suitability by up to 3.5 million ha. Conversely, 3 million ha of lands currently suitable for wheat production are predicted to become climatically unsuitable, along with 13 million ha for maize. At least 328 of 834 (39%) PAs are projected to be affected by altered wheat or maize suitability in their buffer zones.Main conclusions: Reduced crop suitability and food scarcity in subsistence areas may lead to the exploitation of PAs for food and fuel. However, if reduced crop suitability leads to agricultural abandonment, this may afford opportunities for ecological restoration. Expanded crop suitability in PA buffer zones could lead to additional isolation of PAs if portions of newly suitable land are converted to agriculture. These results suggest that altered crop suitability will be widespread throughout South Africa, including within and around lands identified as conservation priorities. Assessing how climate change will affect crop suitability near PAs is a first step towards proactively identifying potential conflicts between human adaptation and conservation planning.",1

However, studies related to the effect on groundwater are relatively few, probably because the effect is neither direct nor simple. This review summarizes the current status, looks at possible mitigation and adaptation strategies, and suggests future direction of research in this area.",1

"Adaptation to climate change in cities is essential, and vertical greenery systems (VGSs) are used as a means of restoring the urban areas' ecological integrity. This paper presents the classification, typology, and benefits of the VGS for the energy performance of buildings. To analyse its energy and environmental impacts, the use of VGS was simulated on the facades of residential buildings in the urban area of the City of Banja Luka. The results showed that VGS reduced the temperature of the wall and air in and around the buildings, as well as the emission of CO2 in the air.",1
"The rising environmental issues on contemporary cities urgently calls for sustainable planning policies. Implementation of nature-based solutions, ecosystem services, and green infrastructures associated to green spaces management is at present of paramount importance. In contrast to policies mainly focused on public greenery, the inclusion of private green in planning strategies might be a promising pathway. The general aim is mapping and classifying urban green spaces in Padua, a city of 93.3 km(2) (Northeast Italy). Specific aims are (i) testing an NDVI-derived extraction from very high-resolution orthophotos; (ii) classifying property status; (iii) highlighting multilevel relationships and strategies for urban green spaces implementation and management; (iv) assessing greenery in relation to per capita population. By performing remote sensing and GIS analyses, a first detailed global map of urban green spaces in Padua was created; then, binary classification and thematic maps for rural/non-rural, public/private, municipal/non-municipal greenery were produced for all urban units. Results show that, among total green spaces (52.23 km(2)), more than half are rural. Moreover, private green spaces represent 80%, while within public areas (20%) less than 10% are municipal (5 km(2)). We therefore highlight scenarios for planning policies in Padua by providing tools to policymakers for an integrated management of green spaces, where private greenery might also contribute to ecosystem services implementation for common urban well-being.",1
"There is mounting evidence that climate change is already having an impact on the wine industry, with effects being region specific. In order to understand the capacity of regional wine sectors to adapt to changing climate, it is useful to document the conditions that are important to producers and to identify adaptation and management strategies that are employed in the industry. This paper analyzes climatic conditions and adaptation strategies in the wine region of Prince Edward County Ontario, Canada. Wine producers identified the climate variables most important to their operations and described strategies they use to manage climate-related conditions. The identified variables were analyzed for trends over the study period 1987-2011, and interview data were analyzed in order to categorize adaptive strategies. Results indicate that the wine sector is very sensitive to climate, and the region is already experiencing the effects of climate change, especially with regard to increasing growing season mean minimum daily temperatures, increasing total summer rainfall, and later onset of fall frosts. Adaptive strategies employed by producers are largely learned though collaborative efforts and trial and error. The adaptations are mostly tactical and reactive in the short term, but with continued climate change, these strategies may develop into strategic, anticipatory measures. Climate change has the potential to present both challenges and opportunities to Prince Edward County wine producers, and adaptations will continue to require strong networking and collaborative efforts.",1
"While climate change mitigation targets necessarily concern maximum mean state changes, understanding impacts and developing adaptation strategies will be largely contingent on how climate variability responds to increasing anthropogenic perturbations. Thus far Earth system modeling efforts have primarily focused on projected mean state changes and the sensitivity of specific modes of climate variability, such as the El Nino-Southern Oscillation. However, our knowledge of forced changes in the overall spectrum of climate variability and higher-order statistics is relatively limited. Here we present a new 100-member large ensemble of climate change projections conducted with the Community Earth System Model version 2 over 1850-2100 to examine the sensitivity of internal climate fluctuations to greenhouse warming. Our unprecedented simulations reveal that changes in variability, considered broadly in terms of probability distribution, amplitude, frequency, phasing, and patterns, are ubiquitous and span a wide range of physical and ecosystem variables across many spatial and temporal scales. Greenhouse warming in the model alters variance spectra of Earth system variables that are characterized by non-Gaussian probability distributions, such as rainfall, primary production, or fire occurrence. Our modeling results have important implications for climate adaptation efforts, resource management, seasonal predictions, and assessing potential stressors for terrestrial and marine ecosystems.",1
"Past research suggests that trait self-control, trait mindfulness, and implicit theories about willpower contribute to self-control, however, their incremental value for this adaptive capacity is unknown. Applying the four-step model of motivated behavior (Hofmann, Baumeister, Forster, & Vohs, 2012), we assessed the frequency of desire experience, resistance, and enactment in everyday life. Results of two highly-powered correlational studies (Study 1: n = 273, Study 2: n = 465) suggest that higher trait self-control is associated with a less frequent experience of desires, higher trait mindfulness with less frequent desire resistance, and a nonlimited theory about willpower is associated with a less frequent enactment of desires. These findings suggest that the traits studied contribute to successful self-control in different ways. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Inc.",0
"As the biggest economy in Canada, the Province of Ontario is now suffering many consequences caused by or associated with global warming, such as frequent and intense heat waves, floods, droughts, and wind gust. Planning of mitigation and adaptation strategies against the changing climate, which requires a better understanding of possible future climate outcomes over the Province in the context of global warming, is of great interest to local policy makers, stakeholders, and development practitioners. Therefore, in this study, high-resolution projections of near-surface air temperature outcomes including mean, maximum, and minimum daily temperature over Ontario are developed, aiming at investigating how the global warming would affect the local climatology of the major cities as well as the spatial patterns of air temperature over the entire Province. The PRECIS modeling system is employed to carry out regional climate ensemble simulations driven by the boundary conditions of a five-member HadCM3-based perturbed-physics ensemble (i.e., HadCM3Q0, Q3, Q10, Q13, and Q15). The ensemble simulations are then synthesized through a Bayesian hierarchical model to develop probabilistic projections of future temperature outcomes with consideration of some uncertain parameters involved in the regional climate modeling process. The results suggest that there would be a consistent increasing trend in the near-surface air temperature with time periods from 2030s to 2080s. The most likely mean temperature in next few decades (i.e., 2030s) would be [-2, 2] A degrees C in northern Ontario, [2, 6] A degrees C in the middle, and [6, 12] A degrees C in the south, afterwards the mean temperature is likely to keep rising by similar to 2 A degrees C per 30-years period. The continuous warming across the Province would drive the lowest mean temperature up to 2 A degrees C in the north and the highest mean temperature up to 16 A degrees C in the south. In addition, the spread of the most likely ranges of future outcomes shows a consistent widening trend from 2030s to 2080s, implying that long-term climate change is more difficult to predict than near-term change because many more uncertain or unknown factors may continue to emerge during the long-term simulation.",0
"Climate and land cover changes are known to exert strong pressure on mountain biodiversity, but the potential interactions between these drivers remain unknown. Research concerning how changes in climate and land cover impact montane species is often based on single-year and short-term studies, which can limit the conclusions about population trends. We used meteorological and vegetation structure data, butterfly counts for 57 species over 14 years, and species' ecological characteristics to examine how changes in climate and land cover affect trends in butterfly populations in a Mediterranean mountain range. Temperature, forest area, shrub cover and vegetation height increased over time, at similar rates across the elevational gradient. While 35% of the butterfly species showed stability in temporal abundance, the proportions that decreased and increased in abundance were similar (24-28%), with comparable rates across the elevational gradient. Species associated with open habitats, and with larval feeding on herbs and grasses, tended to decrease in abundance more than those associated with closed habitats, and with larval feeding on woody plants, thus indicating that population changes were mainly related to vegetation encroachment, but not climate warming. Our findings support the idea that mountains can act as climate refugia relative to more disturbed flat lowlands, which are usually inhabited by butterfly populations tending to decrease in abundance. They also suggest that possible effects of interactions between vegetation encroachment and climate change may counteract negative warming impacts on populations by microclimatic cooling, thus enabling potential adaptation to climate change and protection of biodiversity.",0
"This paper examines barriers and opportunities for climate change adaptation in an urban coastal setting where adaptation is in its infancy. It draws on a diagnostic framework as a foundation for identifying and organising barriers and opportunities in terms of three broad phases of the adaptation process, i.e. (1) understanding the problem, (2) planning adaptation options and (3) managing implementation of such options. Data come from the analysis of documents (e.g. policy, plans and reports) and a survey of 49 representatives from 42 organisations (e.g. government, environmental non-governmental organisations, businesses and local industry and professional associations). Nineteen barriers and/or opportunities pertaining to the different phases of the adaptation process were identified. Three of those barriers (i.e. competing priorities, existing management context and existing ecological context) are our additions to the initial list of common barriers proposed in the diagnostic framework. Barriers pertaining to the understanding phase were the most frequently noted by respondents. The understanding phase was also one which most of the barriers were nevertheless considered as opportunities. Emerging critical barriers and/or opportunities for climate change adaptation included perception of signal, availability and accessibility of information, existing management context and leadership. We propose that addressing these barriers and opportunities would involve improving perception about climate change and availability and accessibility of information, fostering anticipatory planned adaptation through the existing management context and developing leadership for adaptation. Findings from this study may prove useful to other jurisdictions, particularly those where climate adaptation is at its early stages of development.",0

"Community risk and resilience to high-latitude wildfires has received limited conceptual attention, with a comprehensive, integrated framework that unpacks the complex human-fire-climate relationship in high-latitude environments largely missing. In this paper, we use insights from both the climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction literature to build a conceptual framework to understand the factors and dynamics of risk and resilience to wildfires at the community level in high-latitude regions. Using an illustrative case study, the framework demonstrates how unique social and ecological features of high-latitude communities elevate their risk of wildfires and emphasizes the need to think holistically about the different spatial-temporal interactions and interdependencies between fire, humans, and climate in these regions. We find that remoteness, indigeneity, subsistence-based activities, and colonial practices, along with accelerated climate warming, are notable features influencing community risk and resilience to wildfires in high-latitude regions. This framework can help unravel the complex nature of wildfires, guide stakeholders through each phase of the disaster process, and facilitate the development and design of wildfire-related policies and strategies in high-latitude regions.",1

"The hydrological patterns of all natural water bodies pulse in variable rhythms of high and low water. The biodiversity of these ecosystems is driven by the changing nature of the environment, allowing different life strategies to coexist, e.g., by the fast reuse of nutrients when aquatic biota flourish in the recently wetted zones and vice versa. Much of the human culture in hydroscapes has developed as an adaptation to this rhythm, e.g., by using the flood-fertilised floodplains for agriculture or fisheries, or by seasonal migration into or out of the floodplain (transhumance). Technological advances have allowed humans to control, change, or even eliminate this natural water rhythm by building dams, dikes, and canals. Consequently, important ecosystem functions fail, often resulting in failure of human life-support systems but also in the failure and decline of cultural activities. I argue that the loss of socio-cultural connectivity to the rhythms of rivers and other hydrosystems occurs in four phases: (i) loss of direct relationships (e.g., uses of waterborne resources), (ii) loss of indirect relationships (cultural activities that are connected to theses uses), (iii) turning away from the river/hydrosystem (often caused by decreased water quality), and (iv) total oblivion (caused by removal or burial of the hydrosystem). Reintegrating more riverine rhythms into human life would not mean to step back in time but rather to find a combination of revised traditional ecological knowledge, learning from nature, changing values in the context of use of natural resources, and innovations. This paper draws on social-environmental aspects of the River Culture Concept - which attempts to reintegrate respect for the pulsing nature of hydrosystems into modern, sustainable management - and on diverse case studies. Examples are presented on how River Culture Concept approaches may contribute to revitalising socio-ecological linkages to the rhythm of the waters.",1
"Available climate change scenarios indicate that climate change will affect elements of the Swedish climate, and that the exposure and sensitivity of the forest to climate change will differ between regions. Adaptation to climate change is conceptually closely linked to the reduction of the risk of disasters. Based on contemporary theory in behavioural risk research, the aim was to improve the knowledge on the process of adaptation of forest management to climate change among Swedish private individual forest owners. The responses from two questionnaires from 1999 to 2004, respectively, were analysed. Adaptation of forest management to climate change by private individual forest owners in what is currently the hemiboreal bio-climatic zone of Sweden was quantified and shown to increase over the five year period. In 2004 adaptive measures had been taken on a limited fraction of the forest land owned by private individuals in three study areas located along a latitudinal gradient ranging from the nemoral to the boreal bio-climatic zones in Sweden. Adaptive measures were more frequent in two southern study areas than in a northern study area. Measures taken to adapt were similar in all three study areas, except for those strongly conditioned by the current local climate. Among forest owners who had taken measure to adapt, perceptions of much higher risk due to climate change was more frequent for the risk of damage by wind, drought, fungi, and insects than for other risk factors. Further improvement of the knowledge on how the individual forest owners' learn and perceive of climate change, its impacts on risks and options for adaptation is required to develop and successfully implement adaptive climate change policies.

"Through generations of observation and experimentation, the Tay people of Bac Kan Province in the Northern Mountainous Region of Vietnam have developed complex farming systems, cultural practices and an indigenous knowledge base well-suited to their environments. Drawing on data collected through surveys, interviews and focus group discussions, this article first documents some of this knowledge and its role in supporting agricultural production. However, this research also uncovered that contemporary climate change is occurring at rates faster than that knowledge base can meaningfully adjust and adapt. Agricultural productivity was found to be greatly reduced, with men seeking off-farm employment to supplement the loss in income. Agrochemical use has soared and resulted in declines in the health of the local population. Village gender dynamics have also shifted and women have taken on the extra burden of farming. This paper posits that if indigenous knowledge was better integrated into adaptation planning and policies, its conservation and application would enhance resiliency to climate change in indigenous communities and beyond. Simultaneously, it also adds that as the nature, speed and severity of climate change in many marginal areas occur at rates faster than indigenous knowledge can adapt, blended forms of knowledge may offer practical solutions.",1

"Disturbances such as wildfires are an integral part of forest ecosystems, but climate change is increasing their extent, frequency, intensity and severity, compromising forest ecosystem services (ES) that are fundamental to human well-being. Thus, evaluating the risk of losing ecosystem services due to wildfires is essential for anticipating and adapting to future conditions. Here, we analyze the spatial patterns of the risk of losing key forest ES and biodiversity (that is, carbon sink, bird richness, hydrological control and erosion control) due to wildfires in Catalonia (NE Spain), taking into account exposed values, hazard magnitude, susceptibility and lack of adaptive capacity. We also determine the effect of climate and different forest functional types on the risk of losing ES under average and extreme hazard conditions (defined as median and 90th percentile values of the Fire Weather Index, respectively), as well as on the increase in risk. Our results show that hazard magnitude is the most important component defining risk under average conditions. Under extreme conditions, exposed values (carbon sink capacity and erosion control) emerged as the most important components of risk. Climate was the main driver of ES at risk under average conditions, but the high vulnerability of non-Mediterranean conifer forests with a low adaptive capacity gained importance under extreme conditions. The increase in risk between average and extreme conditions was driven by precipitation, as the highest increases in risk were found in relatively wet forests with low average risk at present. These results have direct implications on the future risk of losing ES to wildfires in Mediterranean forests but also in other regions, and they could contribute to future policies by anticipating conditions associated with particularly high risk that can be used to guide efficient forest management.",1
"Green space in cities is important, but not always and everywhere for the same reasons. Based on literature review and empirical evidence, we describe transformations in the roles of urban green space (UGS) across time and place using the ecosystem services concept. Urban development and societal change affect the degree of UGS functionality via different trajectories like degradation, revalorization and community action. We explain triggers of different trajectories of change and emerging trade-offs within society. An improved understanding of the shifting roles of UGS can guide urban planning and prioritize designs that fit current and future demand. Research on UGS and ecosystem services should more strongly connect to the development of urban lifestyles in diverse contexts, expose trade-offs between beneficiaries, and explore options for adaptive governance.",1

"Eggplant (Solanum melongena) is a major vegetable crop with great potential for genetic improvement owing to its large and mostly untapped genetic diversity. It is closely related to over 500 species of Solanum subgenus Leptostemonum that belong to its primary, secondary, and tertiary genepools and exhibit a wide range of characteristics useful for eggplant breeding, including traits adaptive to climate change. Germplasm banks worldwide hold more than 19 000 accessions of eggplant and related species, most of which have yet to be evaluated. Nonetheless, eggplant breeding using the cultivated S. melongena genepool has yielded significantly improved varieties. To overcome current breeding challenges and for adaptation to climate change, a qualitative leap forward in eggplant breeding is necessary. The initial findings from introgression breeding in eggplant indicate that unleashing the diversity present in its relatives can greatly contribute to eggplant breeding. The recent creation of new genetic resources such as mutant libraries, core collections, recombinant inbred lines, and sets of introgression lines will be another crucial element and will require the support of new genomics tools and biotechnological developments. The systematic utilization of eggplant genetic resources supported by international initiatives will be critical for a much-needed eggplant breeding revolution to address the challenges posed by climate change.",1
"Metacognition is a topic of increasing interest in the field of instruction and learning, but its relation to actual teaching behaviors is seldom investigated in second language (L2) classroom research. The purpose of this study was to examine whether and how language teacher metacognition and executive function are linked to high-leverage teaching practice. We recruited foreign and second language teachers (N = 937), including bilingual/ESL teachers, from public schools across the southern United States. We obtained a direct measure of teachers' executive function and an indirect measure of metacognitive capacity. Using the Tripod (7Cs) framework, we also assessed specific aspects of high-leverage teaching practice under 3 broad conceptual areas: personal support, curricular support, and academic press. We examined the mediating role of teacher metacognitive capacity between executive function and exemplary classroom practice, and tested an alternative model. Analyses returned stronger support for our hypothesized model over the alternative, indicating that teacher metacognition-teachers' adaptive capacity to monitor, interpret, evaluate, and intervene on L2 classroom events-constitutes an important mediating condition for building classroom environments that are engaging, demanding, and supportive of learners' L2 development.",0
"Promoting green infrastructure and other nature-based solutions in urban environments is considered an effective approach to achieve resilience and meet sustainability goals. Countries with a post-Socialist history are still struggling to increase the amount of green spaces in cities. Bucharest is an example of a city that has undergone considerable transformation during the Socialist period (1948-1990) and after. Back then the drivers of urban transformation were mainly related to public land management, whereas after the fall of the Socialist regime private development prevailed. Our study aims to analyze the shift in the amount and distribution of green spaces in Bucharest as a consequence of the transition from a centralized planning system to a market-based system. We used historical maps and aerial images to determine spatial-temporal changes in the structure of Bucharest's urban parks and their surrounding areas. To determine the influence of planning approaches on green spaces, we analyzed the legislative framework from the Socialist period (labeled as red) and post-Socialist period. Our results showed that the fall of the Socialist regime represented an important institutional change affecting urban green spaces. There was a major increase in the surface and number of green spaces during the Socialist period and a decrease afterwards as a consequence of a weak legislative framework, restitution of lands and ownership conflicts. Our findings provide valuable knowledge on the evolutionary urban processes and sustainability approaches of the post-Socialist period in Romania and important insights for improving planning efforts and maximizing ecosystem services in cities.",1

"Poultry is the most abundant livestock species with over 60 billion chickens raised globally per year. The majority of chicken are produced from commercial flocks, however many indigenous chicken breeds play an important role in rural economies as they are well adapted to local environmental and scavenging conditions. The ability to make precise genetic changes in chicken will permit the validation of genetic variants responsible for climate adaptation and disease resilience, and the transfer of beneficial alleles between breeds. Here, we generate a novel inducibly sterile surrogate host chicken. Introducing donor genome edited primordial germ cells into the sterile male and female host embryos produces adult chicken carrying only exogenous germ cells. Subsequent direct mating of the surrogate hosts, Sire Dam Surrogate (SDS) mating, recreates the donor chicken breed carrying the edited allele in a single generation. We demonstrate the introgression and validation of two feather trait alleles, Dominant white and Frizzle into two pure chicken breeds using the SDS surrogate hosts. Chicken are a biological model and an important agricultural animal. Here, the authors demonstrate that pure breed genome edited chicks can be produced for any chicken breed by direct mating of sterile surrogate hosts carrying donor genome edited germ cells.",1
"Protected areas face many threats, including the observed and projected impacts of climate change, yet there is little evidence that adaptation strategies are providing comprehensive solutions to deal with ecological transformation due to changing climates. In this article we explore whether, how and to what extent the governance of knowledge helps or hinders managerial change towards more proactive climate adaptation. We applied a knowledge governance framework that addresses social and cultural dimensions of environmental decision-making, alongside the institutional arrangements that support particular knowledge-based relationships, to document the knowledge-based processes in place for managing protected areas under uncertain climate change in Colombia. We found that the results of scientific experimentation and modelling (mainly in the natural sciences) are often stated as the preferred source of knowledge to inform decision making, forming a dominant narrative that climate adaptation can and should be driven by scientific and technical information. However, institutional arrangements in practice were typically more diverse in the knowledge sources that contribute to protected area policy and practice. This indicates a significant mis-match between the desired knowledge base for climate adaptation governance, and the actual knowledge processes that underpin effective planning. We propose that understanding institutional arrangements that shape adaptation decision contexts can help to address barriers for using climate information effectively, including understanding its limitations. It can also help managers identify opportunities to draw on existing diverse and rich knowledge systems to support the institutional transformations needed to enable strategic planning and management for effective climate adaptation.",1

"In West Africa, climate variations and droughts have always affected livelihoods but have also triggered adaptation strategies. A better understanding of the impacts of drought and the responses of West African populations is indispensable for researchers and decision makers in the current and future context of multiple socioeconomic and environmental changes, including climate change. We conducted a systematic review of the literature on drought in West Africa. In this paper, we highlight controversial issues and identify knowledge gaps. Although drought has been widely considered as a major problem in West Africa, there is a need to frame it within a set of multiple threats faced by local populations and to understand how droughts act as a trigger in economic, societal, and environmental contexts. The literature on responses to drought focuses on agricultural and individual responses, while diversification, migration, and tree-based or livestock-based responses are less frequently addressed. More research is needed on the effectiveness and on the unexpected effects of responses of populations, states, and NGOs, as well as on the interactions between different responses. To understand the complexity of impacts and responses, the context in which they occur and how individual and collective actions interact within households or communities needs to be taken into account. Ecosystems and agriculture offer many goods and services that are suitable for adaptation and the different landscape components should be analyzed together. Such historical, contextual, and integrated analyses would better inform new policies and projects for adaptation to climate change.

"The Sacramento and San Joaquin Basins Study is a collaborative long range planning study conducted by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation and state and local partner agencies to assess the impacts of future changes in climate and socioeconomic conditions on water resource management in the Central Valley of California. To account for a range of uncertainty in future conditions through 2100, a scenario-based approach was developed using climate projections available from Couple Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) climate model simulations and sea level rise projections consistent with National Research Council (NRC) and the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Assessment Report 5 (AR5). The performance of the Central Valley water system was evaluated for a range of metrics including water deliveries, water quality, hydropower, flood control, recreation, fish, and wildlife habitats, ESA species, flow dependent ecological resiliency and the economic impacts of water supply changes using an integrated model package that simulates the federal Central Valley Project, the State Water Project and local system operations and regulatory requirements. The study also included the development and evaluation of a range of water management actions that can help reduce or manage future risks posed by potential changes in climate and socioeconomic conditions. Seven adaptation portfolios were explored that each consisted of a variety of water management actions. These thematic portfolios were evaluated to determine their effectiveness in adapting to potential risks posed by future socioeconomic and climate changes and to assess tradeoffs between their relative performances.",1

"Bangladesh is one of the most natural hazard-prone countries in the world with the greatest negative consequences being associated with cyclones, devastating floods, riverbank erosion, drought, earthquake, and arsenic contamination, etc. One way or other, these natural hazards engulfed every corner of Bangladesh. The main aim of this research paper is to carry out a multi-hazards risk and vulnerability assessment for the coastal Matlab municipality in Bangladesh and to recommend possible mitigation measures. To this aim, hazards are prioritized by integrating SMUG and FEMA models, and a participation process is implemented so as to involve community both in the risk assessment and in the identification of adaptation strategies. The Matlab municipality is highly vulnerable to several natural hazards such as cyclones, floods, and riverbank erosion. The SMUG is a qualitative assessment, while FEMA is a quantitative assessment of hazards. The FEMA model suggests a threshold of highest 100 points. All hazards that total more than 100 points may receive higher priority in emergency preparedness and mitigation measures. The FEMA model, because it judges each hazard individually in a numerical manner, may provide more satisfying results than the SMUG system. The spatial distributions of hazard, risk, social institutions, land use, and other resources indicate that the flood disaster is the top environmental problem of Matlab municipality. Hazard-specific probable mitigation measures are recommended with the discussion of local community. Finally, this study tries to provide insights into the way field research combining scientific assessments tools such as SMUG and FEMA could feed evidence-based decision-making processes for mitigation in vulnerable communities.",1
"Urban areas face severe challenges in mitigating and adapting to climate change within limited space. One solution is to develop multifunctional rooftop systems, which use underexploited urban rooftop spaces. Two main options have been to add greenery by installing extensive green roofs (EGRs) or to generate renewable energy by installing photovoltaic panels (PVs). Recently, combining the two systems on one rooftop (EGR-PV) to harvest both benefits has gained attention. Not every rooftop is suitable for such installations, which makes it difficult to estimate the scale of space a city can expect from rooftops to add greenery, renewable energy, or both. This study presents a geographical potential model using building parameters, a building stock layer, and LiDAR data to simultaneously identify the potential for installing EGRs, PVs, and EGR-PVs on rooftops, highlighting the competition and synergy between EGRs and PVs at the building level. As an empirical illustration to support future multifunctional urban rooftop space planning, Amsterdam was used as a case study. The results show that 47 % of rooftops are suitable for EGRs, which could expand the current greenery space by 6 %, and 55 % are suitable for PVs which could sufficiently provide electricity to households by 2030. Moreover, competition exists for 3.2 %, whereas synergy exists for 42 % of the existing rooftops.",1
"While current rates of sea level rise and associated coastal flooding in the New York City region appear to be manageable by stakeholders responsible for communications, energy, transportation, and water infrastructure, projections for sea level rise and associated flooding in the future, especially those associated with rapid icemelt of the Greenland and West Antarctic Icesheets, may be outside the range of current capacity because extreme events might cause flooding beyond today's planning and preparedness regimes. This paper describes the comprehensive process, approach, and tools for adaptation developed by the New York City Panel on Climate Change (NPCC) in conjunction with the region's stakeholders who manage its critical infrastructure, much of which lies near the coast. It presents the adaptation framework and the sea-level rise and storm projections related to coastal risks developed through the stakeholder process. Climate change adaptation planning in New York City is characterized by a multi-jurisdictional stakeholder-scientist process, state-of-the-art scientific projections and mapping, and development of adaptation strategies based on a risk-management approach.",1

"The European Commission established the Covenant of Mayors (CoM) initiative in 2008, aimed at involving and supporting mayors to encourage accomplishing the European Union (EU) climate mitigation and energy targets.In 2014, the Mayors Adapt initiative was set up in order to promote the climate adaptation pillar. Whereas the mitigation pillar is more developed and peer-reviewed literature can be found, adaptation is still lagging behind,not to mention the absence of information on the effectiveness of the CoM concerning the development of climate adaptation plans. This paper aims at presenting a thorough analysis of climate hazard data declared by CoM signatories as well as the degree of regional agreement of those signatories when reporting climate data. Thus, we assume that the signatories belonging to the same climate region should report similar climate hazard data for both current and future timeframes. Using a new statistical method for measuring the variability of categorical data, we determine that, overall, the signatories show low agreement within climate regions. Hence, we conclude that the CoM, in the corresponding part of climate risk assessment, is not as effective as it could be desired.Furthermore, several recommendations are proposed to improve the current reporting.",1
"Analyses of climate adaptation seldom rely on the conceptual toolbox of institutional economics. Yet articles addressing institutions make up a large portion of the climate adaptation literature. With a wealth of institutionally relevant knowledge in the adaptation literature, organizing such knowledge in institutionally meaningful ways can advance the present understanding of the link between institutions and adaptation. Knowing which aspects of this link are well researched, and where in contrast research gaps lie, can provide guidance to institutional economists interested in adaptation. We contribute to this through a systematic review of the adaptation literature, assessing the consideration adaptation scholars give to different elements of the Institutional Analysis and Development framework. Results show a strong focus on collective choice and on adaptation by public actors, with an emphasis on rules in use, social interactions and, to a lesser extent, attributes of the community. Research gaps rather encompass operational and constitutional choice, private adaptation, physical interactions and biophysical conditions.",1
"Grasslands are environments characterized by an elevated biodiversity in plant species, which dynamically evolves over time as a function of management practices, soil properties, and climate conditions. Climate change can locally affect grassland growth and floristic composition and, in turn, the quality and quantity of provided ecosystem services. We show how the use of the plant community model CoSMo allows to explicitly account for the dynamics of floristic composition as response to environmental variables. This, in turn, allows quantifying climate change impacts on grasslands growth and composition and evaluating alternative strategies to improve adaptation in the mid-term. As a case study, we focused on mountain areas in the northern Apennines (Italy), where temporary alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.)-dominated grasslands are sown for the production of Parmesan cheese. Five sites and four alternative climate scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 projections as provided by the HadGEM2 and GISS general circulation models) were considered, to explore a wide range of agro-environmental conditions. Results showed that the observed dynamics of floristic composition and biomass accumulation were successfully simulated, with a mean absolute error lower than 10% for floristic composition and less than 1 t ha-1 for total biomass. Climate change impacts were globally negative, with a clear decrease of forage production as compared to the baseline (from -3.6% to -14.3% according to the climate scenario). The biodiversity of the plant community also declined (12.5% average decrease in the inverse Simpson index) due to the increase in alfalfa dominance. The latter, however, led to preserve the forage crude protein content (+0.9% on average). Guidelines for optimizing grassland productivity and forage protein under future climate were defined, mainly focused on reducing the alfalfa field duration, sowing grass-legume mixtures, and delaying the last cut of the season. These practices can be easily adopted under operational farming conditions to support the adaptation of temporary grasslands to climate change. According to our knowledge, this is one of the first study of climate change impact that uses a plant community model to explicitly considers phytocoenosis dynamics, biodiversity, and their effect on forage production (quantity and quality). Considering the role of grasslands as providers of key ecosystem services - especially in marginal areas - we believe that our modelling approach can support the identification of effective adaptation strategies to address future climate challenges.",1
"The variation of environmental conditions deriving from global climate change in the state of Sinaloa and its impact on the region's main productive activities have not been sufficiently studied.

It also discusses the repercussions of climate change on agricultural activity and aspects related to sea level rise. Finally, the text empathizes on the lack of local estimations and studies that could serve as base for improved planning strategies and initiatives to facilitate adaptation to climate change in the region.",1
"Data on grain yield from field trials on winter wheat under conventional farming, harvested between 1992 and 2008, were combined with daily weather data available for 44 grids covering Denmark. Nine agroclimatic indices were calculated and used for describing the relation between weather data and grain yield. These indices were calculated as average temperature, radiation and precipitation during winter (1 October-31 March), spring (1 April-15 June) and summer (16 June-31 July), and they were included as linear and quadratic covariates in a mixed regression model. The model also included an effect of year to describe the change in yield caused by unrecorded variables such as management changes. The final model included all effects that were significant for at least one of the two soil types (sandy and loamy soils). Seven of the nine agroclimatic indices were included in the final model that was used to predict the wheat grain yield under five climate scenarios (a baseline for 1985 and two climate change projections for 2020 and 2040) for two soil types and two locations in Denmark.The agroclimatic index for summer temperature showed the strongest effect causing lower yields with increasing temperature, whereas yield increased with increasing radiation during summer and spring. Winter precipitation and spring temperature did not affect grain yield significantly. Grain yield responded non-linearly to mean winter temperature with the highest yield at 4.4 degrees C and lower yields both below and above this inflection point.The application of the model predicted that the average yield would decrease under projected climate change. The average decrease varied between 0.1 and 0.8 t/ha (comparable to a relative reduction of 1.6-12.3%) depending on the climate projection, location and soil type. On average, the grain yield decreased by about 0.25 t/ha (c. 3.6%) from 1985 to 2020 and by about 0.55 t/ha (c. 8.0%) from 1985 to 2040. The predicted yield decrease depended on climate projection and was larger for wheat grown in West Zealand than in Central Jutland and in most cases also larger for loamy soils than for sandy soils.The inter-annual variation in grain yield varied greatly between climate projections. The coefficient of variation (CV) varied between 0.16 and 0.46 and was smallest for wheat grown on loamy soils in Central Jutland in the baseline climate and largest for winter wheat grown under one of the 2040 climate projections. The increase in CV is not so much an effect of increased climatic variability under the climate change projections, but more an effect of increased winter temperature, where more extreme winter temperatures (lower or higher than the inflection point at 4.4 degrees C) increased the effect of winter temperatures.",1
"In today's climate of government outsourcing and multiple stakeholder involvement in public sector management and service delivery, it is more important than ever to rethink and redesign the structure of how policy decisions are made, implemented, monitored, and adapted to new realities. The traditional command-and-control approach is now less effective because an increasing amount of responsibility to deliver public goods and services falls on networks of nongovernment agencies. Even though public administrators are seeking new decision-making models in an increasingly more complex environment, the public sector currently only sparsely utilizes Mediated Modeling (MM). There is growing evidence, however, that by employing MM and similar tools, public interest networks can be better equipped to deal with their long-term viability while maintaining the short-term needs of their clients. However, it may require a shift in organizational culture within and between organizations to achieve the desired results. This paper explores the successes and barriers to implementing MM and similar tools in the public sector and offers insights into utilizing them through a review of case studies and interdisciplinary literature. We aim to raise a broader interest in MM and similar tools among public sector administrators at various administrative levels. We focus primarily, but not exclusively, on those cases operating at the interface of ecology and socio-economic systems.",0
"Estuaries are threatened coastal ecosystems that support relevant ecological functions worldwide. The predicted global climate changes demand actions to understand, anticipate and avoid further damage to estuarine habitats. In this study we reviewed data on polychaete assemblages, as a surrogate for overall benthic communities, from 51 estuaries along five Marine Ecoregions of Brazil (Amazonia, NE Brazil, E Brazil, SE Brazil and Rio Grande). We critically evaluated the adaptive capacity and ultimately the resilience to decadal changes in temperature and rainfall of the polychaete assemblages. As a support for theoretical predictions on changes linked to global warming we compared the variability of benthic assemblages across the ecoregions with a 40-year time series of temperature and rainfall data. We found a significant upward trend in temperature during the last four decades at all marine ecoregions of Brazil, while rainfall increase was restricted to the SE Brazil ecoregion. Benthic assemblages and climate trends varied significantly among and within ecoregions. The high variability in climate patterns in estuaries within the same ecoregion may lead to correspondingly high levels of noise on the expected responses of benthic fauna. Nonetheless, we expect changes in community structure and productivity of benthic species at marine ecoregions under increasing influence of higher temperatures, extreme events and pollution.

"Viticulture and winemaking are important socioeconomic sectors in many European regions. Climate plays a vital role in the terroir of a given wine region, as it strongly controls canopy microclimate, vine growth, vine physiology, yield, and berry composition, which together determine wine attributes and typicity. New challenges are, however, predicted to arise from climate change, as grapevine cultivation is deeply dependent on weather and climate conditions. Changes in viticultural suitability over the last decades, for viticulture in general or the use of specific varieties, have already been reported for many wine regions. Despite spatially heterogeneous impacts, climate change is anticipated to exacerbate these recent trends on suitability for wine production. These shifts may reshape the geographical distribution of wine regions, while wine typicity may also be threatened in most cases. Changing climates will thereby urge for the implementation of timely, suitable, and cost-effective adaptation strategies, which should also be thoroughly planned and tuned to local conditions for an effective risk reduction. Although the potential of the different adaptation options is not yet fully investigated, deserving further research activities, their adoption will be of utmost relevance to maintain the socioeconomic and environmental sustainability of the highly valued viticulture and winemaking sector in Europe.",1
"Climate change remains a significant threat to farm households, especially in developing countries. It exacerbates their vulnerability to food insecurity by reducing agricultural productivity and raising agricultural production costs. Adoption of climate smart-agricultural (CSA) practices is a promising alternative to build resilient farm households. In this study, we assessed the impacts of adopting CSA practices on climate resilience and vulnerability among farm households in Bale-Eco Region, Ethiopia. A power calculation was used to determine the sample size, and 404 farm households were randomly selected to collect data using structured questionnaire. We estimated household climate resilience index using categorical principal component analysis, and vulnerability index using vulnerability as expected poverty approach. Endogenous switching regression model, which is conditional on the adoption of multiple CSA practices and used to control selection bias and unobserved heterogeneity, was used to assess the impacts of CSA practices on household climate resilience and vulnerability. We employed counterfactual approaches to assess the impacts. The results show that the average treatment effects for most CSA practices are statistically significant and positive for resilience, but negative for vulnerability. This provides empirical support for interventions in climate-smart agriculture, which can help farm households build resilience and reduce vulnerability. We, therefore, suggest that agricultural policies should encourage the adoption of CSA practices and provide incentive packages to farm households that promote this.",1
"With the ongoing growth of gene-based research in recent decades, examining changes that have taken place in structures over the course of evolution has become increasingly accessible. One intriguing subject at the forefront of evolutionary research is how environmental pressures affect species evolution through epigenetic adaptation. This article presents the available molecular components of adaptation to cold environments in two extinct mammals: the woolly mammoth and the Neanderthal. These two species coexisted in similar geographic and environmental European settings during the Middle and Upper Pleistocene, and both were direct descendants of African ancestors, although both fully evolved and adapted in Europe during the Middle Pleistocene. The authors assessed the degree of resemblance between mammoth and Neanderthal genetic components by reviewing three case studies of relevant gene variants and alleles associated with cold-climate adaptation found in both genomes. Their observations present the likelihood of a molecular resemblance between the suites of cold adaptation traits in the two species.",0
"Recent developments in the vulnerability literature have contested the use of technical solutions as the sole adaptive strategies to reduce natural hazard impact; this literature emphasizes the need to attend to the wider everyday risks to which people are exposed and that aggravate hazard vulnerability. Using a case study of two flood-prone communities in Puerto Rico, this article supports and enhances that literature by placing floods within a wider context of other risks and determining how everyday risks influence people's perceptions of and capacity to adapt to floods. Participatory methods are used to elicit the everyday risks that concern community members. The analysis reveals that participants perceive floods as one of their risks, but they see them as neither the most important nor most severe risk in their lives. Instead, they find other concerns-health conditions, family well-being, economic factors, and land tenure-more pressing. These competing risks limit adaptive capacity and increase vulnerability to natural hazards. The results suggest that addressing these multiple risks, mainstreaming flood management and adaptation into the wider context of people's general well being, and increasing risk perception will strengthen adaptive capacity to present and future floods.",1
"Habitat restoration and creation within human-altered landscapes can buffer the impacts of climate change on wildlife. The Forestry Reclamation Approach (FRA) is a coal surface mine reclamation practice that enhances reforestation through soil decompaction and the planting of native trees. Recently, wetland creation has been coupled with FRA to increase habitat available for wildlife, including amphibians. Our objective was to evaluate the response of pond-breeding amphibians to the FRA by comparing species occupancy, richness, and abundance across two FRA age-classes (2-5-year and 8-11-year reclaimed forests), traditionally reclaimed sites that were left to naturally regenerate after mining, and in mature, unmined forests in the Monongahela National Forest (West Virginia, USA). We found that species richness and occupancy estimates did not differ across treatment types. Spotted Salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum) and Eastern Newts (Notophthalmus viridescens) had the greatest estimated abundances in wetlands in the older FRA treatment. Additionally, larger wetlands had greater abundances of Eastern Newts, Wood Frogs (Lithobates sylvaticus), and Green Frogs (L. clamitans) compared to smaller wetlands. Our results suggest that wetland creation and reforestation increases the number of breeding sites and promotes microhabitat and microclimate conditions that likely maximize the resilience of pond-breeding amphibians to anticipated climate changes in the study area.",1
"Non-technical summary: Our analysis shows that the framing of social vulnerability is shaped by a narrow definition of resilience, focusing on post-disaster return and recovery responses. This perspective does not account for the dynamism and non-stationarity of social-ecological systems (SES) which is becoming increasingly important in the face of accelerating environmental change. Incorporating social-ecological resilience into social vulnerability analysis can improve coastal governance by accounting for adaptation and transformation, as well as scale and cross-scale interactions.Technical summary: Social vulnerability analysis has been unable to deliver outcomes that reflect the reality of vulnerability and its consequences in an era characterised by accelerating environmental change. In this work, we used critical discourse analysis and key informant interviews to understand different framings of social vulnerability in coastal governance and management, globally and in New Zealand. We found that the framing of system vulnerability could vary depending on the definition of resilience adopted, which has critical ramifications for coastal governance of linked systems of humans and nature. We found that the framing of social vulnerability in coastal governance is mainly influenced by engineering, community and disaster resilience, focusing on return and recovery governance responses to environmental change (e.g. hurricanes, wildfires). Instead, we suggest a novel perspective based on social-ecological resilience, which more accurately reflects the dynamics of linked systems of humans and nature (SES). This revised perspective, general vulnerability, accounts for the dynamics of Earth's systems across various spatial and temporal scales in the face of accelerating environmental change. Accounting for social-ecological resilience and its core aspects (i.e. panarchy, adaptation and transformation) is essential for informing coastal governance of SES (Do we adapt? or Do we transform the SES?).Social media summary: Social-ecological resilience is essential for social vulnerability analysis in the face of accelerating environmental change.",1
"Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive type of brain cancer with remarkable cell migration and adaptation capabilities. Exploratory adaptation-utilization of random changes in gene regulation for adaptive benefits-was recently proposed as the process enabling organisms to survive unforeseen conditions. We investigate whether exploratory adaption explains how GBM cells from different anatomic regions of the tumor cope with micro-environmental pressures. We introduce new notions of phenotype and phenotype distance, and determine probable spatial-phenotypic trajectories based on patient data. While some cell phenotypes are inherently plastic, others are intrinsically rigid with respect to phenotypic transitions. We demonstrate that stochastic exploration of the regulatory network structure confers benefits through enhanced adaptive capacity in new environments. Interestingly, even with exploratory capacity, phenotypic paths are constrained to pass through specific, spatial-phenotypic ranges. This work has important implications for understanding how such adaptation contributes to the recurrence dynamics of GBM and other solid tumors.",0
"Background: Climate change affects human health with those with the least resources being most vulnerable. However, little is known about the impact of climate change on human health and effective adaptation methods in informal settlements in low- and middle-income countries.Objective: The objective of this scoping review was to identify, characterize, and summarize research evidence on the impact of climate change on human health in informal settlements and the available adaptation methods and interventions.Method: A scoping review was conducted using the Arksey and O'Malley framework. The four bibliographic databases PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane library were searched. Eligibility criteria were all types of peer-reviewed publications reporting on climate change or related extreme weather events (as defined by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change), informal settlements (as defined by UN-Habitat), low- and middle-income countries (as defined by the World Bank) and immediate human health impacts. Review selection and characterization were performed by two independent reviewers using a predefined form.Results: Out of 1197 studies initially identified, 15 articles were retained. We found nine original research articles, and six reviews, commentaries, and editorials. The articles were reporting on the exposures flooding, temperature changes and perceptions of climate change with health outcomes broadly categorized as mental health, communicable diseases, and non-communicable diseases. Six studies had a geographical focus on Asia, four on Africa, and one on South America, the remaining four articles had no geographical focus. One article investigated an adaptation method for heat exposure. Serval other adaptation methods were proposed, though they were not investigated by the articles in this review.Conclusion: There is a paucity of original research and solid study designs. Further studies are needed to improve the understanding of the impact, the most effective adaptation methods and to inform policy making.",1

"Climate change is an urgent threat to perinatal and infant health, with the greatest effects of climate change exposures being felt disproportionately by global majority communities who have been most harmed by systems of oppression. Human milk feeding is one recognized solution to bolster climate resilience. Yet, policies and practices to support human milk as a climate solution are inconsistent and under-prioritized, which is unsurprising given the lack of alignment between human history and current cultural context with regard to lactation and human milk access. This paper presents a new framework on lactation as a climate solution, which is unique in its incorporation of the critical history of cooperative breastfeeding in our species. Rooted in anthropogeny, or the study of human origins, and antiracist principles of lactation, the Allomilk Framework highlights five concepts of the ideal application of human milk as a climate solution, bridging ancient allonursing with present-day lactation and human milk access. These ideal applications-and the proposed development of measures to operationalize them-will advance the field through a shared understanding of the qualities that should be prioritized in the assessment of policies and practices at the intersection of climate resilience and human milk access. Application of the Allomilk Framework to assess and design future policies and practices will advance the field by increasing the potential for climate resilience and climate mitigation while working with-rather than against-the importance of cooperative breastfeeding in human history.",1

"Over the past 30 years, US-based research on contaminated and potentially-contaminated sites, or brownfields, has grown from defining the scope and size of the environmental, health and economic risks posed by abandoned manufacturing sites to exploring and documenting site-specific and area-wide impacts of their cleanup and revitalisation. From early and varied research on environmental and economic policy to equity and public impacts on minority communities, later research considered planning, adding case studies on sustainability and resilience to the scope of research covered. This review paper stems from exchanges of a long-standing network of academic, government agency, and practice professionals working to identify research, policy, and practice gaps. It traces the evolution of US brownfield revitalization research as was informed by, and informed, policy, program and practice. This review summarizes the literature and identifies research gaps and opportunities to further community and agency actions related to investigating, remediating, and redeveloping brownfield sites. It outlines site and area options to build climate resilience, strengthen community action for dismantling structural racism and disinvestment, and reduce the disproportionate risks experienced by communities of colour and areas of low income. The authors propose a new research agenda to address the gaps identified.",1
"Perennial energy cropping systems are hailed as a sustainable way of mitigating and potentially adapting to climate change. As a result of the absence of tillage, soils cropped with perennials like cup plant (Silphium perfoliatum) promote abundant and functionally diverse earthworm communities. Hence, ecosystem service provision because of earthworm activity and functional redundancy, for example, litter decomposition, water infiltration and nutrient turnover, is considerably enhanced in perennial cropping systems. We studied the abundance and functional role of earthworms in non-tilled perennial systems and reduced-tilled annual systems to assess their relationship with the respective above-ground organic residues and their implications for the soil water dynamic. We sampled earthworms and simultaneously measured the saturated infiltration rate for two consecutive years in cup plant and maize (Zea mays) fields. Furthermore, we sampled above-ground litter each trimester in both systems and analysed the total C and N content and CN ratios. Our field investigations revealed significantly higher earthworm abundance, species diversity and richness in cup plant systems likely because of the absence of tillage and the formation of a litter layer. High abundances of juveniles in both maize and cup plant systems pointed to harsh habitat conditions likely because of temperature variations, waterlogging and bulk density. The respective field litter was of minor importance as a food source in both systems because of poor quality, but may positively affect the soil water balance in cup plant systems. Earthworm populations in maize may have been supported by organic fertilizer while earthworm populations in cup plants may have additionally benefitted from the extensive root network and a higher on-site plant diversity. Reduced tillage regimes in maize systems may have enhanced saturated infiltration rates. A direct link between earthworms and infiltration was not validated, but may not be excluded in the future, as earthworm populations may develop slowly because of adverse habitat conditions. Our results show that perennials support abundant and diverse earthworm populations and indicate the importance of functional redundancy and the diversity of food sources. The combination of both earthworm abundance and perennial cropping systems is capable of increasing on-site ecosystem stability and supporting adaptation to climate change by increasing functional redundancy and, ultimately, providing ecosystem services. The noticeable occurrence of the latter, however, may be delayed because of the slow establishment of earthworm communities and delayed build-up of ecosystems stability. Hence, a transitional phase is inevitable to reap the benefits of perennial energy cropping systems and must be accounted for.",1
"The uncertainty of climatic or weather variations makes human adaptation a challenging task. Though lots of techno developments have taken place addressing the need of predictions and forecasting of climatic behavior, the uncertainty of atmospheric and geoprocesses poses a severe challenge to the effectivity of efforts in dealing with disasters. It has become very crucial to understand the future atmospheric uncertainty process and further predict and forecast for analysis of different activities based on geographical locations. Climate parameters are mandatorily required to improve system activities and output analysis of acquired data. For a sustainable adaptation, this is very important on how the uncertainty of variations in climatic parameters is dealt and the decisions based upon appropriate forecasting model are taken. The work has primarily focused on the development of an appropriate model, training the model with massive monthly rainfall and temperature data which can be used to analyze any climatic predictions and provide support to deal with adverse future situations. This model determines the appropriate amount of rainfall and temperature varied during the dry season and helps set a relationship with other input variables like humidity and maximum and minimum temperature. The model has been trained and tested using the obtained data and performed well with better accuracy. The model developed using long short-term memory algorithm of deep learning for predicting rainfall and temperature climatic variables is supported with the study of the main factors affecting monthly climatic change analysis. Monthly precipitation, rainfall intensity, and temperature have been used in the multipurpose prediction model to analyze the monthly and yearly climatic change prediction. The model has also been optimized for precision, accuracy, and computational speed, which are affected by number of iterations, neurons of a hidden layers, epochs, and batch size.",1
"The spatial and temporal characteristics of the frequencies of four types of high-impact weather (HIW), i.e. snowfall, thunderstorms, fog and hailstorms, were analysed in China during 1959-2014. Results indicate a significant decrease in the number of snowfall days, thunderstorm days and thunderstorm spells in all six regions of China, with regional decreasing rates of 0.1-3.4 days, 1.6-5.1 days and 0.23-0.77 times per decade respectively. The number of foggy days, hailstorm days and snowfall spells decreased at rates of 0.2-1.8 days, 0.1-0.7 days and 0.14-0.44 times per decade respectively in almost all regions and fog and hailstorm spells decreased at rates of 0.06-0.17 and 0.001-0.043 times per decade respectively in most regions of China. Spatially, there was more snowfall in northeastern China and western China, and more thunderstorms in southern China and southwestern China. The number of fog events was larger in some high mountain stations, eastern China and central China. Hailstorms were concentrated on Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Over the past 56 years, snowfall days, thunderstorm days and thunderstorm spells decreased in most parts of China, and hailstorm days decreased in northeastern China, most parts of northern China and Tibet, southern Qinghai and western Sichuan. The spatial trends of foggy days, foggy spells, snowfall spells and hailstorm spells were not significant in most parts of China. With global warming, some types of HIW are likely to increase in their intensities, so more mitigation and adaptation strategies are still essential for local government and the public in China.",1
"Understanding coping and adaptation behaviour of different population groups in the context of global environmental change has become increasingly important, especially in regions with high vulnerability such as Sub-Saharan drylands. In this regard, household strategies tend to be dependent on local and context-specific conditions. However, the strategic development of climate change adaptation measures, as well as natural resource and migration management on national and international level require transferable results and recommendations. In this paper, a first attempt is made to address the lack of meta-knowledge and to create a bigger trans-regional picture on the topic. It provides an exploratory and systematic synthesis of quantitative and qualitative data from 63 studies covering more than 9700 rural households from Sub-Saharan African drylands. Relevant household coping and adaptation strategies under different types of environmental change are assessed with a particular focus on the role and relative significance of migration. The results demonstrate that strategies related to crop, livestock, soil and water management are, by far, the most common. Yet, various forms of migration are reported as strategy by about 23% of the households. Corroborated by qualitative findings, this emphasises the importance of migration for responding to unfavourable environmental conditions at the household level. Based on the synthesised literature, future directions for research needed to support socially and ecologically sustainable coping and adaptation are provided.",1
"The main characteristics of the heat accumulation period and the possible existence of different types of biological response to the environment in different populations of olive through the Mediterranean region have been evaluated. Chilling curves to determine the start date of the heat accumulation period were constructed and evaluated. The results allow us to conclude that the northern olive populations have the greatest heat requirements for the development of their floral buds, and they need a period of time longer than olives in others areas to completely satisfy their biothermic requirements. The olive trees located in the warmest winter areas have a faster transition from endogenous to exogenous inhibition once the peak of chilling is met, and they show more rapid floral development. The lower heat requirements are due to better adaptation to warmer regions. Both the threshold temperature and the peak of flowering date are closely related to latitude. Different types of biological responses of olives to the environment were found. The adaptive capacity shown by the olive tree should be considered as a useful tool with which to study the effects of global climatic change on agro-ecosystems.",1
"Higher-order finite element method requires valid curved meshes in three-dimensional domains to achieve the solution accuracy. When applying adaptive higher-order finite elements in large-scale simulations, complexities that arise include moving the curved mesh adaptation along with the critical domains to achieve computational efficiency. This paper presents a procedure that combines B,zier mesh curving and size-driven mesh adaptation technologies to address those requirements. A moving mesh size field drives a curved mesh modification procedure to generate valid curved meshes that have been successfully analyzed by SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory researchers to simulate the short-range wakefields in particle accelerators. The analysis results for a 8-cavity cryomodule wakefield demonstrate that valid curvilinear meshes not only make the time-domain simulations more reliable, but also improve the computational efficiency up to 30%. The application of moving curved mesh adaptation to an accelerator cavity coupler shows a tenfold reduction in execution time and memory usage without loss in accuracy as compared to uniformly refined meshes.",0

"Insect life cycles are adapted to a seasonal climate by expressing alternative voltinism phenotypes-the number of generations in a year. Variation in voltinism phenotypes along latitudinal gradients may be generated by developmental traits at critical life stages, such as eggs. Both voltinism and egg development are thermally determined traits, yet independently derived models of voltinism and thermal adaptation refer to the evolution of dormancy and thermal sensitivity of development rate, respectively, as independent influences on life history. To reconcile these models and test their respective predictions, we characterized patterns of voltinism and thermal response of egg development rate along a latitudinal temperature gradient using the matchstick grasshopper genus Warramaba. We found remarkably strong variation in voltinism patterns, as well as corresponding egg dormancy patterns and thermal responses of egg development. Our results show that the switch in voltinism along the latitudinal gradient was explained by the combined predictions of the evolution of voltinism and of thermal adaptation. We suggest that latitudinal patterns in thermal responses and corresponding life histories need to consider the evolution of thermal response curves within the context of seasonal temperature cycles rather than based solely on optimality and trade-offs in performance.This article is part of the theme issue 'Physiological diversity, biodiversity patterns and global climate change: testing key hypotheses involving temperature and oxygen'.",1
"The impact of climate change on economic growth has been the subject of numerous studies in recent years, with macro-econometric analyses estimating the effect of rising temperatures on gross domestic product (GDP) growth rates at the country-level. However, the distributional impact of warming on inequality and poverty at the micro-level remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between temperature and inequality in South Africa at the national and sub-national level. Our analysis reveals a significant U-shaped relationship between temperature and inequality indices, with inequality lowest at moderate temperatures (11 degrees C-18 degrees C) and increasing sharply as temperatures increase. We find that the optimal temperatures are lower for inequality measures than for income levels. This indicates that substantial increases in inequality are expected at higher temperatures compared to growth impacts. This effect is particularly noticeable for the poorer segments of the population, whose productivity and wages decline as temperatures increase, while the impact on the richer segments is less significant due to their greater adaptive capacity. In terms of mechanisms, we find that agricultural households are more likely to experience an increase in inequality due to warming. Our findings suggest that global warming has two adverse effects on hot countries: reducing average growth and increasing inequality. We compare the outcomes of the moderate RCP6.0 scenario to a reference scenario without warming and find that by the end of the century, the Gini coefficient in South Africa is expected to increase by 3-6 points, resulting in a potential welfare loss of approximately 50% when combined with the impact of warming on GDP (which alone can reach up to 43% by 2100 in South Africa). Our findings highlight the importance of investigating the distributional effects of climate change at the micro-level, particularly in low-or middle-income countries where vulnerable populations are more susceptible to its impacts.",1
"Urban waterbodies can effectively mitigate the increasing UHI effects and thus enhance climate resilience of urban areas. To contribute to our limited understanding in cooling effect ofwaterbodies on surrounding thermal environments, we examine the quantitative relationship between the spatial distribution of urban waterbodies and the land surface temperature (LST) in Wuhan, China. This paper 1) applies two indicators, the fractional water cover and the gravitywater index, formeasuring the spatial distribution of urbanwaterbodies; 2) conducts simple linear regression and spatial regression analyses to explore the LST-water relationship atmultiple scales; and 3) compares the individual regression results fromdifferent land use types. The results showthat the spatial distribution of urban waterbodies affects the LST significantly, and the gravity water index sufficiently explains the LST variation at various scales. Furthermore, the impact of urban waterbody distribution on the LST does vary across different land use types. Conclusions from this study provide insights of the cooling effect of urban waterbodies, which can further assist city planners and decision makers in utilizing cooling effects ofwaterbodies to improve the thermal environment of urban areas.

"In Italy, the current reform of the planning system intends to modify the land-use planning model and to address regeneration and environmental issues in contemporary cities, involving both public and private actors. In this perspective, Performance-based planning can use market-based tools such as urban and territorial equalisation, compensation and local taxation to support and incentivise the design of Nature-based solutions, Green and blue infrastructures and Ecosystem services. This article presents research developed for the Metropolitan City of Milan. The research identifies a number of environmental indicators that evaluate the outcomes of the metro-politan and local planning process and actions. The evaluation will allow the Metropolitan City to differentiate financing policies and promote multiple actors to achieve sustainability goals using the territorial and urban equalisation tool and a connected bonus reward system.",1
"A community's adaptive capacity in relation to a rapidly changing coastline is strongly related to the perception of environmental risks. Such perceptions are, however, not well understood at the level of communities and have seldom been compared from one country to another. A framework for natural hazard perception is presented using the concept of functional awareness. This level of consciousness sufficient to influence behaviour is represented by a set of indicators that reflect the perception 1) of dreadfulness, 2) of uncertainty and 3) behavioural change. We conducted a survey (n = 125) in three communities exposed to coastal erosion and coastal flooding in Avignon (Quebec), Kilkeel (Northern Ireland) and Chipiona (Andalucia) to measure three themes: 1) the citizen's general knowledge about coastal change, 2) the perception of coastal changes in their community compared to that reported in the scientific literature and 3) their preferences for adaptation solutions. Multivariate analysis was used to identify the main socio-demographical descriptors. The main factors that influence perception were the site characteristics, the cultural experience of the coast, educational level, and duration in the community. Accounting for all three communities, the functional awareness scores exposed that the weakest ability lays in the fragmentation of preferences towards potential solutions. For Kilkeel and Chipiona, this was related to the difficulty of accurately identifying the environmental hazard trends and a lower degree of personal experience of coastline change. In Avignon, which is more functionally aware, partly thanks to targeted education & information and repeated experiences of hazards, the fragmentation of solution preferences would rather be related to inner community variation. Robustly used in these three countries, the functional awareness framework helped identify each community perception breaks and could be used to identify activities to strengthen community adaptive capacity.

"This paper examines the determinants affecting adaptation strategies adopted by men and women in char farming households in Zanjira, Bangladesh, to deal with floods. The term char land refers to a mid-channel island that periodically appears in the riverbed owing to accretion. The study used primary and secondary data. Primary data were collected from a household survey from 115 men and 128 women, interviews with key informants, focus group discussions and in-depth interviews with farmers. For a gender analysis, the study used two separate step-wise regression models. Results showed that significant variables determining adaptation strategies included agricultural land access, availability of agricultural labor, experience in farming, literacy, age, and training. Both regressions showed a good fit of the model. The higher adjusted R-2 values for the female model revealed that the determinants included are more critical for flood adaptation strategies than those in the male model. Regression results revealed that agricultural land access, agricultural labor, and literacy were the most important determinants for both groups. Agriculture land access and literacy were more important for women than men. This suggests that women's land accessibility and literacy need to be improved to help them better adapt to floods. The influence of agricultural labor also seemed equally important for men and women. These findings inform useful policy recommendations for dealing with floods. Promoting less labor-intensive but more remunerative adaptation strategies would help men and women manage farming effectively.",1

"Climate change continues to impact the livelihoods of smallholder farmers due to low adaptive capacity. In South Africa, the challenge is exacerbated by water scarcity and shortened crop-growing seasons. Climate-smart irrigation innovative technologies (CSIT) enhance smallholder farmers' resilience to climate change. However, there is still a limited level of effective adoption and usage of these technologies in smallholder communities. This study investigated the barriers affecting the adoption of CSIT in rural areas of the Vhembe and Capricorn districts in Limpopo Province, South Africa. We explored the farmers' socioeconomic factors extracted from farmers' perceptions of CSIT-specific attributes. A multi-stage randomized sampling technique was used to select 100 smallholder farmers (SHF). Data analyzed by descriptive statistics such as percentages and frequency distribution are presented in graphs and tables. According to the findings, insufficient communication channels, a lack of financial availability, unstable land tenure systems, and insufficient training are the main obstacles to implementing CSIT. There is a need for policy and decision-makers to improve the communication channels for disseminating agro-meteorological information to the intended beneficiaries.",1
"We develop a potentially widely applicable framework for analysing the vulnerability, resilience risk and exposure of chondrichthyan species to all types of anthropogenic stressors in the marine environment. The approach combines the three components of widely applied vulnerability analysis (exposure, sensitivity and adaptability) (ESA) with three components (exposure, susceptibility and productivity) (ESP) of our adaptation of productivity-susceptibility analysis (PSA). We apply our 12-step ESA-ESP analysis to evaluate the vulnerability (risk of a marked reduction of the population) of each of 132 chondrichthyan species in the Exclusive Economic Zone of southern Australia. The vulnerability relates to a species' resilience to a spatial (or suitability) reduction of its habitats from exposure to up to eight climate change stressors. Vulnerability also relates to anthropogenic mortality added to natural mortality from exposure to the stressors of five types of fishing and seven other types of anthropogenic hazards. We use biological attributes as risk factors to evaluate risk related to resilience at the species or higher taxonomic level. We evaluate each species' exposure to anthropogenic stressors by assigning it to one of six ecological groups based on its lifestyle (demersal versus pelagic) and habitat, defined by bathymetric range and substrates. We evaluate vulnerability for 11 scenarios: 2000-2006 when fishing effort peaked; 2018 following a decade of fisheries management reforms; low, medium and high standard future carbon dioxide equivalent emissions scenarios; and their six possible climate-fishing combinations. Our results demonstrate the value of refugia from fishing and how climate change exacerbates the risks from fishing.",1
"This article examines whether the use of climate change as a 'spice' in order to attract donor funding may instead exacerbate existing environmental problems. The World Bank's latest adaptation project in coastal Bangladesh aims to create higher and wider embankments against rising sea levels. This disregards a long history of how embankments, by stopping beneficial monsoon inundations, result in dying rivers and damaging floods that devastate rural livelihoods. Bangladeshi 'development brokers' must therefore balance their roles as project employees supporting embankments as adaptation, and as locals knowledgeable about their harmful effects. The article shows how donors, NGOs, consultants and government bodies with different agendas, priorities and knowledge backgrounds 'translate' climate change to legitimise their activities. It contributes to debates about the politics of environmental knowledge production by arguing that development brokerage helps explain why some climate adaptation projects increase environmental vulnerability, while others address local needs.",1
"Adaptation and resilience are two concepts originally developed in dissimilar problem contexts but which are of significant importance for our ability to respond to a changing climate. While both concepts encompass processes of change they differ in several important areas. This article discusses the relationship between the two concepts and highlights three issues concerned with our ability to respond to and manage change. First, although adaptation responses can help to build resilience, they just as easily can undermine resilience. Second, the magnitude of change may be outside our abilities to adapt, and thus it is not always possible to maintain system resilience. Finally, resilience is not a normative concept. The desirability of a resilient system, or community, must be considered in light of social goals and how benefits and risks are distributed. Better appreciation of the relationship between the concepts of adaptation and resilience will provide more effective tools to plan for, and respond to, current and future change.

"There is an imperative worldwide need to identify effective approaches to deal with water-related risks, and mainly with increasingly frequent floods, as well as with severe droughts. Particularly, policy and decision-makers are trying to identify systemic strategies that, going beyond the mere risk reduction, should be capable to deal simultaneously with multiple challenges (such as climate resilience, health and well-being, quality of life), thus providing additional benefits. In this direction, the contribution of Nature Based Solutions (NBS) is relevant, although their wider implementation is still hampered by several barriers, such as the uncertainty and lack of information on their long-term behavior and the difficulty of quantitatively valuing their multidimensional impacts. The activities described in the present paper, carried out within the EU funded project NAIAD, mainly aim at developing a participatory System Dynamic Model capable to quantitatively assess the effectiveness of NBS to deal with flood risks, while producing a multiplicity of co-benefits. The adoption of a participatory approach supported both to increase the available knowledge and the awareness about the potential of NBS and hybrid measures (e.g. a combination of NBS and socio-institutional ones). Specific reference is made to one of the demos of the NAIAD project, namely the Glinscica river case study (Slovenia). (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.",1
"Vulnerability of agriculture to drought conditions is closely related to the challenges of sustainable agriculture and food security. Information on agricultural drought vulnerability status at different scales is crucial for prescription, development and implementation of long-term drought management measures. This study is on developing a composite index for measuring crop-generic agricultural drought vulnerability at disaggregated level, in the erstwhile Andhra Pradesh state of India. By analyzing the data on soils, irrigation, farm holdings, rainfall, rainy days, cropping pattern and satellite-based crop condition, 22 input indicators for 1038 spatial units called Mandals (within-the-district administrative units) were generated and segregated into exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity components of vulnerability. The composite index was computed for each component by generating the weights for inputs through variance approach. Agricultural drought vulnerability index was generated for each Mandal by combining the three component indices and beta distribution was fitted to it to generate vulnerability classes. Results indicate that the vulnerable group of Mandals represents 57% of agricultural area and 67% of rain-fed crop area of the state. The geographical pattern of vulnerability is well captured by the composite index. Districts dominant with vulnerable Manclals showed frequent drought occurrence and higher crop yield variability. The vulnerability map can be instrumental in prioritizing the areas for drought management interventions. Since the methodology was applied over a large geographic area with diverse conditions of weather, soil and crop, its utility over other geographies is also established. Indicators selection and weights generation are the critical aspects for further research. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",1
"By using micro-farm household survey data from six counties in the Hubei and Yunnan provinces, warm days, heavy precipitation, and consecutive dry days were selected as extreme weather measures, and the RClimDex software was used to empirically examine the impacts of extreme weather on farm household poverty vulnerability by setting percentile thresholds to measure extreme weather indicators in each district and county in 2017. Based on the improved Department for International Development sustainable livelihoods analysis framework, the entropy value method was used to synthesize the variables in the farm household sustainable livelihood capacity to examine their mediating effects. The results were as follows: 1) Extreme weather significantly affected farm household poverty vulnerability. Warm days were significantly and negatively related to farmers' poverty vulnerability, while total heavy precipitation and consecutive dry days were significantly and positively related to farmers' poverty vulnerability. 2) The impacts of extreme weather on farmers with different vulnerability characteristics varied. 3) The sustainable livelihood capacity of farm households played a partially mediating role in the process of extreme weather indicators of persistent drought index affecting the poverty vulnerability of farm households. 4) As compared to rural households engaged in non-agricultural industries, agricultural production and operation-based farming households were more vulnerable to shocks from extreme weather. Accordingly, we recommended that to improve farmers' climate resilience, differentiated policies should be adopted according to local conditions; climate-sensitive vulnerable groups should be identified; agricultural insurance coverage should be expanded; farmers should be guided into entrepreneurship; and equalization of public services should be equalized so as to avoid farmers becoming impoverished due to extreme weather.",1
"With the enactment of Air Pollution Action Plan in 2013, the air quality improved in most Chinese cities, except that surface ozone (O-3) increased markedly. Some recent studies have examined this issue and presented controversial opinions, but only focus on summertime ozone increase. This study extends a comprehensive analysis of the influencing factors on China's ozone changes from 2013 to 2017 out of the summer season, combining satellite data, ground measurements and model analyses. The annual trends of air pollutants, e.g., increase in 95th percentile O-3 concentration (+1.4-8.7 mu g m(-3) yr(-1)), and decreases in fine particulate matter (PM2.5; -4.0 similar to-7.5 mu g m(-3) yr(-1)) and sulfur dioxide (-2.6 similar to-9.7 mu g m(-3) yr(-1)) are uncovered by satellite and observational data. Model results show that the attributions of surface O-3 changes from 2013 to 2017 vary spatially and seasonally, and most regions are more affected by emission changes (-9.5-47.0 mu g m(-3)) rather than meteorological changes (-8.1-21.3 mu g m(-3)). In specific regions and seasons, e.g., south/southwestern and eastern China south of 35 degrees N in May and July, the surface O-3 responses to climate variability could have an equal or even greater importance than emission changes. In these major pollution control regions, e.g. northern and mid-eastern China, the precursor emissions control (11-35%) contributes in the same degree as the changes in aerosol effects (35-38%) to surface ozone enhancement in the warm seasons. More scientific emission controls and climate adaptation strategies are required to attain the synergetic control of atmospheric particulate matter and ozone in China.",0
"Increasingly, climate change policies are emerging across Europe. Policies addressing adaptation (adjusting the effects of climate change on public health) are being implemented after the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to identify issues in climate adaptation implementation for public health and understand the health implications from responses after COVID-19.METHODS: Key informant interviews were undertaken with decision makers in international, national, and local governments across 20 European countries (Norway, England, Cyprus, Spain, Ireland, Finland, Lithuania, Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden, Latvia, Italy, Estonia, Austria, Croatia, France, Germany, Hungary, Denmark, and Scotland). A WHO stakeholder analytical framework was followed for developing the interview themes. Participants were recruited if based in European governments, working in public or environmental health, and involved in climate adaptation policy. Participants were recruited through known networks and geographical coverage was obtained (eight per European region). An interview schedule with key themes (barriers, public health agenda, levers, networks, evidence needs, and COVID-19 recovery) was used. Interviews were conducted online, recorded, transcribed, and analysed through Nvivo.FINDINGS: 32 interviews were completed between June and October, 2021; four international stakeholders, five national-level decision makers, 23 city-level decision makers or network representatives. Most reported inadequate resources for health adaptation implementation (funding, training, and personnel) and the marginal role of health in climate adaptation policy. A key reported challenge was limited departmental cross-collaboration across governance levels, because city-level stakeholders were less aware of the public health role in climate change policy. COVID-19 recovery strategies were not perceived as opportunistic for future adaptation. However, several respondents identified benefits for health system resilience, for example improved emergency planning and disaster management.INTERPRETATION: Across Europe, there is varied progress in the implementation of climate change and health adaptation. Providing appropriate resource, inter-departmental collaboration, knowledge mobilisation, and multi-level governance support will facilitate climate and health policy implementation. Overcoming these barriers and learning from COVID-19 through strengthened emergency planning and responses to climate events can strengthen UK public health system resilience and beyond.FUNDING: This project has received part-funding from the Enhancing Belmont Research Action to support EU policy making on climate change and health project, which is part of the EU's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant agreement number 101003966).

"In the last decades, climate change and the rapid urbanization due to the development of the coastal economy have led to biodiversity loss and the fragmentation of habitat in many coastal zones. The presence of protected areas cannot prevent the progress of land degradation. However, these areas are very important because they provide significant ecosystem services and affect local tourism. With regard to increasing adaptation strategies to human pressures and climate change, the present study proposes a detailed monitoring activity and an ecological restoration plan which could improve the resilience of a protected coastal zone in the Pantano forest of Policoro, located on the Ionian coast (southern Italy). In this area, continuous phenomena of intensive deforestation, hydraulic reclamation actions, and fires have reduced the native species of particular naturalistic value, favouring the advancement of desertification, coastal erosion, and saltwater intrusion. The proposed actions are derived from a preliminary analysis on maps, UAV-images, climate data and from meetings with the local community. The operative process detailed in this article could be applied to other protected areas which are subjected to the same phenomena and problems.",1
"The device has a U type plate (1) whose upper surface is provided with a fixing plate (2). A lower surface of the fixing plate is provided with two symmetrical clamping plates (3). The clamping plate and the U type plate are provided with multiple first fixing holes that are distributed in equal distance. The U type plate and the fixing plate are provided with a second fixing hole (6) that is provided with a bolt (7). A three-ring chain (5) is sleeved with the bolt. The fixing plate and the U type plate are fixedly connected with the two symmetrical mounting seats (8). A sliding block assembly (9) is connected with a buffer assembly. An end of the buffer component is connected with a fixing block (12) that is connected with a collision block (13). USE - Mining endless rope vehicle transportation anti-falling road connecting and protecting device. ADVANTAGE - The device improves endless rope transportation in variable slope, adaptive capacity of steering, solving the problem that the shuttle car and the connected vehicle end buffer are mutually extruded and easy to turn off. The buffer assembly mounted on the sliding block assembly is good for keeping the distance between two vehicles to prevent the end head from colliding and extruding. The chain will not bite the chain in the narrow frame, it greatly reduces the vehicle due to the turning, caused by changing slope phenomenon, which not only reduces the occurrence of accident, creates good environment for the production of worker safety but also reduces the labor intensity of the worker to a certain degree, and saves cost.

"Appeals to the importance of place are limited in the adaptation literature. While place has been acknowledged to contribute to individual and collective identity, its broader role representing meaningful connection between people and location has not been sufficiently developed or acknowledged in this literature, and is largely absent from key IPCC documents. As climate change disconnects people from their surroundings, it can compromise their sense of place. The loss of connection with one's environs generates difficulties, not only in that under such conditions it is harder to find food, water, and shelter, but also in that under such conditions one is unable to recognize what choices and options are available. This paper contends that these choices and options are vital for human flourishing. Relying on the capabilities approach, according to which human flourishing should be understood not in terms of whether some state has been achieved, but whether an individual has the capacity to bring about certain chosen and endorsed states of being, this paper argues that place and place-making are central to human flourishing and should play a significant role in our adaptation strategies.",1
"Whether old-growth (OG) forests have higher genetic diversity and effective population size, consequently higher conservation value and climate adaptive potential than second-growth (SG) forests, remain an unresolved issue. We have tested the hypothesis that old-growth forest tree populations have higher genetic diversity, effective population size (N-E), climate adaptive potential and conservation value and lower genetic differentiation than second-growth forest tree populations, employing a keystone and long-lived conifer, eastern white pine (EWP; Pinus strobus). Genetic diversity and population structure of old-growth and second-growth populations of eastern white pine (EWP) were examined using microsatellites of the nuclear and chloroplast genomes and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in candidate nuclear genes putatively involved in adaptive responses to climate and underlying multilocus genetic architecture of local adaptation to climate in EWP. Old-growth and second-growth EWP populations had statistically similar genetic diversity, inbreeding coefficient and inter-population genetic differentiation based on nuclear microsatellites (nSSRs) and SNPs. However, old-growth populations had significantly higher chloroplast microsatellites (cpSSRs) haploid diversity than second-growth populations. Old-growth EWP populations had significantly higher coalescence-based historical long-term N-E than second-growth EWP populations, but the linkage disequilibrium (LD)-based contemporary N-E estimates were statistically similar between the old-growth and second-growth EWP populations. Analyses of population genetic structure and inter-population genetic relationships revealed some genetic constitution differences between the old-growth and second-growth EWP populations. Overall, our results suggest that old-growth and second-growth EWP populations have similar genetic resource conservation value. Because old-growth and second-growth EWP populations have similar levels of genetic diversity in genes putatively involved in adaptive responses to climate, old-growth, and second-growth populations may have similar adaptive potential under climate change. Our results could potentially be generalized across most of the boreal and temperate conifer forest trees. Our study contributes to address a long-standing issue, advances research field and knowledge about conservation and ecological and climate adaptation of forest trees.",0

"Erosion and flooding are the main threats for most coastal regions. Nature-based solutions, such as coastal vegetation (CV) fields, have received significant attention in recent years because they effectively dissipate wave energy while maintaining biodiversity. In this study, a porous medium model was implemented in an in-house software to simulate the three-dimensional, two-phase (water/air) flow induced by wave propagation past CV fields. First, the model was validated against experimental measurements of wave propagation past a CV field on a horizontal bed. Then, the model was used to assess the influence on wave behaviour of the equivalent porosity, n(eq), and the cross-shore length, L-CV, of a CV field with a constant plant height on a beach with a constant bed slope. Results were obtained for the non-vegetated case (n(eq) = 1) and five vegetated cases with different n(eq) and L-CV values. It was found that decreasing n(eq) moves wave breaking offshore at larger depths (40% increase for the case with n(eq) = 0.82), while it does not affect much the breaking height (4% was the largest difference). For very high n(eq) (0.98 in the present study) and/or small L-CV (83% of the wavelength just offshore of the CV field in the present study), wave breaking may occur at depths smaller than in the non-vegetated situation due to increased wave shoaling over the corresponding CV fields. The undertow distribution is strongly modified and an increased wave setup (highest for n(eq) = 0.82) is observed for all vegetated cases in comparison to the non-vegetated one.",1

"Climate is one of the main factors controlling winegrape production. Bioclimatic indices describing the suitability of a particular region for wine production are a widely used zoning tool. Seven suitable bioclimatic indices characterize regions in Europe with different viticultural suitability, and their possible geographical shifts under future climate conditions are addressed using regional climate model simulations. The indices are calculated from climatic variables (daily values of temperature and precipitation) obtained from transient ensemble simulations with the regional model COSMO-CLM. Index maps for recent decades (1960-2000) and for the 21st century (following the IPCC-SRES B1 and A1B scenarios) are compared. Results show that climate change is projected to have a significant effect on European viticultural geography. Detrimental impacts on winegrowing are predicted in southern Europe, mainly due to increased dryness and cumulative thermal effects during the growing season. These changes represent an important constraint to grapevine growth and development, making adaptation strategies crucial, such as changing varieties or introducing water supply by irrigation. Conversely, in western and central Europe, projected future changes will benefit not only wine quality, but might also demarcate new potential areas for viticulture, despite some likely threats associated with diseases. Regardless of the inherent uncertainties, this approach provides valuable information for implementing proper and diverse adaptation measures in different European regions.",1
"To better understand the genetic outcomes of the translocation and inform future management strategies, we quantified the genetic diversity of translocated individuals, and then simulated how genetic diversity would erode over time under different scenarios: single translocation, additional augmentations, and rates of natural immigration. For such isolated populations, which are typical for many translocations, future augmentations and maintaining connectivity through the planning of a recovery network is critical to meet the stated goals of increasing genetic diversity and population persistence. In particular, we argue that an a priori assessment will improve translocation practices that define goals, feasibility, and adaptive strategies to maintain genetic diversity of at-risk populations.",1
"Organic farming (OF) has been believed to be capable of curtailing some hazardous effects associated with chemical farming (CF). However, debates also exist on whether OF can feed a world with increasing human population. We hypothesized that some improvements on OF may produce adequate crops and reduce environmental pollutions from CF. This paper makes comparative analysis of crop yield, soil organic matter and economic benefits within the practice on Biodiversity Management of Organic Farming (BMOF) at Hongyi Organic Farm (HOF) over eight years and between BMOF and CF. Linking crop production with livestock to maximal uses of by-products from each production and avoid xenobiotic chemicals, we have achieved beneficial improvement in soil properties, effective pest and weed control, and increased crop yields. After eight years experiment, we have obtained a gradual but stable increase in crop yields with a 9.6-fold increase of net income. The net income of HOF was 258,827 dollars and 24,423 dollars in 2014 and 2007 respectively. Thus, BMOF can not only feed more population, but also increase adaptive capacity of agriculture ecosystems and gain much higher economic benefits.",1
"Natural resource managers are tasked with assessing the impacts of climate change on conservation targets and developing adaptation strategies to meet agency goals. The complex, transboundary nature of climate change demands the collaboration of scientists, managers, and stakeholders in this effort. To share, integrate, and apply knowledge from these diverse perspectives, we must engage in social learning. In 2009, we initiated a process to engage university researchers and agency scientists and managers in collaborative learning to assess the impacts of climate change on terrestrial fauna in the state of Wisconsin, USA. We constructed conceptual Bayesian networks to depict the influence of climate change, key biotic and abiotic factors, and existing stressors on the distribution and abundance of 3 species: greater prairie-chicken (Tympanuchus cupido), wood frog (Lithobates sylvaticus), and Karner blue butterfly (Plebejus melissa samuelis). For each species, we completed a 2-stage expert review that elicited dialogue on information gaps, management opportunities, and research priorities. From our experience, collaborative network modeling proved to be a powerful tool to develop a common vision of the potential impacts of climate change on conservation targets.

"Understanding covariation patterns of drought resistance, post-drought recovery and phenotypic plasticity, and their variability at the intra-population level are crucial for predicting forest vulnerability to increasing aridity. This knowledge is particularly urgent at the trailing range edge since, in these areas, tree species are proximal to their ecological niche boundaries. While this proximity increases their susceptibility, these populations are recognized as valuable genetic reservoirs against environmental stressors. The conservation of this genetic variability is critical for the adaptive capacity of the species in the current context of climate change. Here we examined intra-population patterns of stem basal growth, gas exchange and other leaf functional traits in response to an experimental drought in seedlings of 16 open-pollinated families within a marginal population of European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) from its southern range edge. We found a high degree of intra-population variation in leaf functional traits, photosynthetic performance, growth patterns and phenotypic plasticity in response to water availability. Low phenotypic plasticity was associated with higher resistance to drought. Both drought resistance and post-drought recovery of photosynthetic performance varied between maternal lines. However, drought resistance and post-drought recovery exhibited independent variation. We also found intra-population variation in stomatal sensitivity to soil drying, but it was not associated with either drought resistance or post-drought recovery. We conclude that an inverse relationship between phenotypic plasticity and drought resistance is not necessarily a sign of maladaptive plasticity, but rather it may reflect stability of functional performance and hence adaptation to withstand drought. The independent variation found between drought resistance and post-drought recovery should facilitate to some extent microevolution and adaption to increasing aridity. The observed variability in stomatal sensitivity to soil drying was consistent with previous findings at other scales (e.g., inter-specific variation, inter-population variation) that challenge the iso-anisohydric concept as a reliable surrogate of drought tolerance.",1
"Climate change is an emerging challenge that is triggering natural variabilities and disasters globally. In Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) region of Pakistan, Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) have been occurring frequently due to glacier surges, increasing the vulnerability of mountain communities, particularly small farmers. This research aims to investigate the climate change-induced GLOFs of the Shishper glacier in Hunza valley of GB with the intent of studying the farming activities; local awareness and perceptions toward climate change; impacts of climate change and GLOFs on agriculture; and adaptation mechanisms based on indigenous knowledge. Mixed-methods research approach was employed for a field survey in two villages inhabited by farmers of the Burusho community. Quantitative data were gathered from a sample of 180 respondents by using a structured questionnaire, whereas field observation coupled with photography and spot interviews were undertaken to accumulate qualitative data. Results revealed that many farmers lost their fertile land, and their crops and fruit orchards were severely damaged as a result of the devastating effects of climate change and recent GLOFs in 2019 and 2020, resulting in low crop yield and agricultural income. Local communities typically respond to GLOFs through self-help strategies and indigenous methods to sustain their livelihoods. However, our findings suggest that current adaptation practices are insufficient in light of rising climate risks. Thus, there is an urgent need to assist mountain communities by providing maximum support and interventions to enhance their resilience to future GLOFs and to increase people's adaptive capacity by strengthening their socioeconomic conditions.",1
"Rapid and interacting change poses an increasing threat to livelihoods and food production, and pastoralists in Nordland, northern Norway, are at a crossroads both economically and culturally. Some of these changes are localized and pertain to changing weather and grazing conditions caused by climate change and land fragmentation. Others, driven by national management policies and governance specifically related to predators, are poorly adjusted for the different and localized contexts. The pastoralists are inherently adaptive and have a long history of responding well to variable changing conditions. This is now changing with the continued increasing pressures from many directions. The central government systematically ignores pastoralists' traditional knowledge and enforces narrow sector policies to be implemented at regional and local levels. We address the effect of how institutional, physical, and societal constraints challenge pastoralists' prospects for sustainable adaptation. Our results show how pastoralists' livelihoods become compromised and potentially threatened because they are forced to respond in ways that they know are counterproductive in the long run. Adaptation outcomes are affected by different approaches and epistemologies that are situated across scale and context in terms of regional and national regulations versus local empirical reality among the pastoral communities. This study concludes that radical change is needed toward a more holistic governance in which multiple knowledge systems are integrated to ensure sustainable adaptation at all levels. This study is based on extensive and long-term fieldwork among reindeer herders and sheep farmers in Nordland, through a collaborative process of knowledge coproduction.",1
"Droughts significantly impact forest ecosystems, reducing forest health and productivity, compromising ecosystem functioning, and nature-based solutions for climate change. The response and resilience of riparian forests to drought are poorly understood despite their key role in the functioning of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Here we investi-gate riparian forest drought responses and resilience to an extreme drought event at a regional scale. We also examine how drought event characteristics, average climate conditions, topography, soil, vegetation structure, and functional diversity shape the resilience of riparian forests to drought. We used a time series of the Normalized Difference Vege-tation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) to calculate the resistance to and recovery after an extreme drought (2017-2018) in 49 sites across an Atlantic-Mediterranean climate gradient in North Portugal. We used generalized additive models and multi-model inference to understand which factors best explained drought re-sponses. We found a trade-off between drought resistance and recovery (maximum r = -0.5) and contrasting strate-gies across the climatic gradient of the study area. Riparian forests in the Atlantic regions showed comparatively higher resistance, while Mediterranean forests recovered more. Canopy structure and climate context were the most relevant predictors of resistance and recovery. However, median NDVI and NDWI had not returned to pre-drought levels (RcNDWI mean = 1.21, RcNDVI mean = 1.01) three years after the event. Our study shows that riparian forests have contrasting drought response strategies and may be susceptible to extended legacy effects associated with extreme and/or recurring droughts, similarly to upland forests. This work highlights the drought vulnerability of riparian eco-systems and emphasises the need for further studies on long-term resilience to droughts.",1
"This article investigates the transition dynamics related to Jatropha developments in Mozambique. The analysis focuses on how structural conditions (infrastructure, institutions, interaction and collaboration and capabilities and resources) enable or constrain interactions between niche-level Jatropha experiments and incumbent energy, agriculture and rural development regimes in Mozambique. Investors in agro-industrial Jatropha projects focused on establishing projects in areas with relatively good infrastructure, rather than in remote rural areas. Furthermore, they predominantly focused on Jatropha production instead of investing in the entire Jatropha value chain, which turned out to be a challenge in itself, as growing a productive Jatropha crop was much more complex than initially anticipated. The development of institutions that could nurture and protect Jatropha projects from the prevailing regimes lagged behind Jatropha project establishment, leading to an insecure investment climate. Strong inter-ministerial collaboration and organized civil society interaction and representation contrasted with non-organized private sector and rather isolated smallholder Jatropha projects. The global financial crisis and limited adaptive capacity reduced the time and space for experimentation and learning to overcome disappointing crop performance. Together, this hampered Jatropha's potential to challenge the energy, agricultural and rural development regimes. Nevertheless, the Jatropha experience did initiate the development of policy and regulation and stimulated interaction and collaboration between specific groups of stakeholders, which could provide the basis to capture future biofuel momentum in Mozambique.",0
"Early-stage fitness variation has been seldom evaluated at broad scales in forest tree species, despite the long tradition of studying climate-driven intraspecific genetic variation. In this study, we evaluated the role of climate in driving patterns of population differentiation at early-life stages in Pinus sylvestris and explored the fitness and growth consequences of seed transfer within the species range. We monitored seedling emergence, survival and growth over a 2-yr period in a multi-site common garden experiment which included 18 European populations and spanned 25 degrees in latitude and 1700 m in elevation. Climate-fitness functions showed that populations exhibited higher seedling survival and growth at temperatures similar to their home environment, which is consistent with local adaptation. Northern populations experienced lower survival and growth at warmer sites, contrary to previous studies on later life stages. Seed mass was higher in populations from warmer areas and was positively associated with survival and growth at more southern sites. Finally, we did not detect a survival-growth trade-off; on the contrary, bigger seedlings exhibited higher survival probabilities under most climatic conditions. In conclusion, our results reveal that contrasting temperature regimes have played an important role in driving the divergent evolution of P. sylvestris populations at early-life stages.",1
"As in the past, most Pacific Island people live today along island coasts and subsist largely on foods available both onshore and offshore. On at least two occasions in the 3500 years that Pacific Islands have been settled, sea level changes affected coastal bioproductivity to the extent that island societies were transformed in consequence. Over the past 200 years, sea level has been rising along most Pacific Island coasts causing loss of productive land through direct inundation (flooding), shoreline erosion and groundwater salinization. Responses have been largely uninformed, many unsuccessful. By the year 2100, sea level may be 1.2m higher than today. Together with other climate-linked changes and unsustainable human pressures on coastal zones, this will pose huge challenges for livelihoods. There is an urgent need for effective and sustainable adaptation of livelihoods to prepare for future sea level rise in the Pacific Islands region. There are also lessons to be learned from past failures, including the need for adaptive solutions that are environmentally and culturally appropriate, and those which appropriate decision makers are empowered to design and implement. Around the middle of the twenty-first century, traditional coastal livelihoods are likely to be difficult to sustain, so people in the region will need alternative food production systems. Within the next 20-30 years, it is likely that many coastal settlements will need to be relocated, partly or wholly. There are advantages in anticipating these needs and planning for them sooner rather than later. In many ways, the historical and modern Pacific will end within the next few decades. There will be fundamental irreversible changes in island geography, settlement patterns, subsistence systems, societies and economic development, forced by sea level rise and other factors.",1
"Climate uncertainties pose a problem for decision makers as they cannot choose and implement an effective adaptation strategy in infrastructure. An effective adaptation strategy can be derived only when the potential damage induced by climate change is well understood. This study proposed a decision making model to evaluate the economic feasibility of the adaptation projects in an urban area. The climate scenarios and the economic and technical factors were used to calculate the volatility that reflects the potential damage reduction of an urban area. The model relies on a type of real options, called the chooser option, to consider managerial flexibility for long-term management of urban infrastructure. The proposed model can estimate the economic value of investment with reasonable accuracy based on the representative concentration pathway (RCP) climate scenarios. A case study involving a disaster prevention facility in Seoul, Korea was conducted to demonstrate the model's applicability. The model is expected to provide guidance for the development of effective adaptation strategies for urban infrastructure. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",1
"The bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa is well known to have a remarkable adaptive capacity allowing it to colonise many environments. A recent study on environmental isolates from dental unit waterlines (DUWLs) hinted at a genetic clustering into two groups. Isolates from one of these groups, named cluster III, were shown to have unusual phenotypes for environmental isolates, such as an increased biofilm production. To have a better ecological view, more specifically on isolates from cluster III, the complete genomes of 39 isolates including 16 from DUWLs were sequenced. In addition to an investigation of antibiotic resistance and secretion system gene content, a molecular phylogeny allowed confirmation of the split of the 16 environmental isolates in two groups and also sheds light on a correlation between the phylogenetic positions and the serotypes of the isolates. Isolates from cluster III harboured insertion sequences ISPa11 inserted into the O-specific antigen biosynthesis clusters and the gene lasR, encoding for a master regulator of the quorum sensing. Investigation of key regulators revealed another truncated gene, gacS. Alteration in lasR and gacS genes was consistent with phenotypic assays confirming their inactivation. These results bring new perspectives regarding the ecological adaptive potential of P. aeruginosa.",0

"An emerging solution in mine waste remediation is the use of biological processes, such as microbial sulfate reduction (MSR), to immobilize metals, reducing their bioavailability and buffering the pH of acid mine drainage. Apart from laboratory tests and local observations of natural MSR in, for example, single wetlands, little is known about spatiotemporal characteristics of freshwater MSR from multiple locations within entire hydrological catchments. We here applied an isotopic fractionation (delta S-34 values in SO42-) and a Monte Carlo-based mixing analysis scheme to detect MSR and its variation across two major mining regions (Imetjoki, Sweden and Khibiny, Russia) in the Arctic part of Europe under different seasonal conditions. Results indicate a range of catchment-scale MSR values in the Arctic of similar to 5%-20% where the low end of the range was associated with the non-vegetated, mountainous terrain of the Khibiny catchment, having low levels of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). The high end of the range was related to vegetated conditions provided by the Imetjoki catchment that also contains wetlands, lakes, and local aquifers. These prolong hydrological residence times and support MSR hot spots reaching values of similar to 40%. The present results additionally show evidence of MSR persistence over different seasons, indicating large potential, even under relatively cold conditions, of using MSR as part of nature-based solutions to mitigate adverse impacts of (acid) mine drainage. The results call for more detailed investigations regarding potential field-scale correlations between MSR and individual landscape and hydroclimatic characteristics, which, for example, can be supported by the isotopic fractionation and mixing scheme utilized here.",1
"The need to assess and measure how social vulnerability influences the health impacts of climate change has resulted in a rapidly growing body of research literature. To date, there has been no overarching, systematic examination of where this evidence is concentrated and what inferences can be made. This scoping review provides an overview of studies published between 2012 and 2022 on social vulnerability to the negative health effects of climate change. Of the 2115 studies identified from four bibliographic databases (Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, and CAB Direct), 230 that considered indicators of social vulnerability to climate change impacts on health outcomes were selected for review. Frequency and thematic analyses were conducted to establish the scope of the social vulnerability indicators, climate change impacts, and health conditions studied, and the substantive themes and findings of this research. 113 indicators of social vulnerability covering 15 themes were identified, with a small set of indicators receiving most of the research attention, including age, sex, ethnicity, education, income, poverty, unemployment, access to green and blue spaces, access to health services, social isolation, and population density. The results reveal an undertheorisation and few indicators that conceptualise and operationalise social vulnerability beyond individual sociodemographic characteristics by identifying structural and institutional dimensions of vulnerability, and a preponderance of social vulnerability research in high-income countries. This Review highlights the need for future research, data infrastructure, and policy attention to address structural, institutional, and sociopolitical conditions, which will better support climate resilience and adaptation planning.",1
"Biological invasions provide opportunities to study evolutionary processes occurring over contemporary timescales. To explore the speed and repeatability of adaptation, we examined the divergence of life-history traits to climate, using latitude as a proxy, in the native North American and introduced European and Australian ranges of the annual plant Ambrosia artemisiifolia. We explored niche changes following introductions using climate niche dynamic models. In a common garden, we examined trait divergence by growing seeds collected across three ranges with highly distinct demographic histories. Heterozygosity-fitness associations were used to explore the effect of invasion history on potential success. We accounted for nonadaptive population differentiation using 11 598 single nucleotide polymorphisms. We revealed a centroid shift to warmer, wetter climates in the introduced ranges. We identified repeated latitudinal divergence in life-history traits, with European and Australian populations positioned at either end of the native clines. Our data indicate rapid and repeated adaptation to local climates despite the recent introductions and a bottleneck limiting genetic variation in Australia. Centroid shifts in the introduced ranges suggest adaptation to more productive environments, potentially contributing to trait divergence between the ranges.",0

"Fish resources are critical to the food security of many nations. Similar to most contemporary food systems, many fisheries and aquaculture resource supply chains are heavily dependent on fossil fuels. Energy price increases and volatility may hence undermine food security in some contexts. Here, we explore the relationships between energy price changes, fish resource supply chain viability, seafood availability and food security outcomes - both for producers and consumers of fish resources. We begin by characterizing the energy intensities of fish resource supply chains, which are shown to be highly variable. We subsequently assess the comparative magnitude and distribution of potential food security impacts of energy price increases for nation states by scoring and ranking countries against a set of vulnerability criteria including metrics of national exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity. Considerable variability in the vulnerability of populations and high levels of exposure for already food-insecure populations are apparent. Developed countries are likely to be most exposed to the effects of energy price increases due to their high rates of fleet motorization and preference for energy-intensive seafood products. However, heavy reliance on seafood as a source of food and income, as well as limited national adaptive capacity, translates into greater overall vulnerability in developing countries. At the level of individual producers, a variety of adaptation options are available that may serve to reduce vulnerability to energy price changes and hence contribute to increased food security for producers and consumers, but uptake capacity depends on numerous situational factors.

"Urban areas are expected to continue their rapid growth in the twenty-first century. Globally, cities are major sources of greenhouse gases emissions and their high population densities make them potential focal points of vulnerability to global environmental change. Moreover, their reach, in terms of flows of materials and resources, extends far outside their borders. Evidently, it is no longer tenable to consider urban systems to be static artefacts constructed in a stable environment, nor continue to divorce them from the global context that influences many of the climatic and socioeconomic changes within cities. Furthermore, the uncertainty in the future climatic and socio-economic conditions poses significant challenges for planners. A framework is proposed for analysing urban systems with evidence-based tools over extended time scales. This forms the basis of a manifesto for future challenges and research directions for this critical subject area, which ultimately will help engineers and urban planners to better understand the areas for which they are responsible and to develop adaptation strategies that can tackle the challenges posed by long-term global change and lead to more sustainable cities.",1
"This paper is based on a study of Palestinian intermarried families (Palestinian men married to American and European women) residing in Palestinian cities of the West Bank. Specifically, it addresses the interface of cultural adaptation and the socialization of children (children socialization) in the midst of political conflict. Cultural adaptation strategies were typified by the extent to which each spouse embraces the partner's culture, while children socialization patterns were typified according to dominant cultural setting chosen by the family. The findings show that parental choices of cultural adaptation were reflected in the ways they chose to socialize their children. Conflicts over children socialization occurred only when the parents opted for opposing cultural adaptation styles. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict was found to influence parents' cultural adaptation and children socialization, deepening existing conflicts and cultural differences within the family.",0

"Climate change continues to supress food and water security in the world and its impacts are worse in Sub-Saharan Africa where there are limited mitigation and adaptation strategies. Although African continent has received massive attention in the development of EWSs, number of researches have highlighted ineffectiveness of these systems such as lack of community engagement throughout their developments. As such, many rain-fed agricultures and rural communities remain vulnerable in the presence of EWSs and persist to be demoralised by harsh realities of climate change. In this paper, we develop English-isiZulu language translator that will be embedded into the EWS that integrates both indigenous and scientific knowledge to aid farmers in cropping decisions and foreseeing of climate related events. The translator is built around agricultural vocabulary related to weather and cropping decisions. The aim of this translator is to enhance communication and dissemination element of the EWS by translating EWMs to isiZulu language to bridge the language barrier between semi-literate isiZulu speakers and EWS.",1
"This research uses a game-theoretic approach to analyze electric power provision for irrigation in Andhra Pradesh, based on results from interview and survey data. Farmers face a coordination problem of collectively preserving electric power quality and a linked dilemma of obtaining sufficient electric infrastructure capacity from utilities. Low equilibria prevail due to asymmetric payoffs and farmers not knowing electric network properties. The findings derived from survey data, empirical tests, and model synthesis indicate how the capacity dilemma can be overcome to enable coordinated technology adoption via farmers' and utilities' investment into energy-efficient and economically viable technology. Coordinated demand-side measures could effectively reduce energy use and support adaptation to climate change. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",1
"New Zealand's agricultural sector faces the challenge of maintaining productivity while minimizing impacts on freshwaters. This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of various green infrastructure systems designed to reduce diffuse agricultural sediment and nutrient loads. Utilizing a quantitative economic and contaminant reduction modeling approach, we analyze the impacts of five interceptive mitigation systems: riparian grass filter strips, constructed wetlands, woodchip bioreactors, filamentous algal nutrient scrubbers, and detainment bunds. Our approach incorporates Monte Carlo simulations to address uncertainties in costs and performance, integrating hydrological flow paths and contaminant transport dynamics. Mitigation systems are assessed individually and in combination, using a greedy cyclical coordinate descent algorithm to find the optimal combination and scale of a system for a particular landscape. Applying the model to a typical flat pastoral dairy farming landscape, no single system can effectively address all contaminants. However, strategic combinations can align with specific freshwater management goals. In our illustrative catchment, the mean cost to remove the full anthropogenic load is NZD 1195/ha for total nitrogen, NZD 168 for total phosphorus, and NZD 134 for suspended solids, but results will vary considerably for other landscapes. This study underscores the importance of tailored deployment of green infrastructure to enhance water quality and support sustainable agricultural practices.",1

"Climate variability in recent decades has intensified in the SSA region, which makes it imperative to explore adequate adaptation and mitigation strategies to offset its current and future adverse impacts. Farmers' perception of climate variability can significantly influence their coping, mitigation, and adaptation potential. This study assessed farmers' perceptions of indicators and consequences of climate variability and explored factors influencing their perception of climate variability and adoption of climate coping strategies. A crosssectional survey design was used to sample 300 farmers in the Central Highlands of Kenya. Binary logistic regression models were used to determine factors that influenced the perception of climate variability, adaptation, and mitigation strategies based on three predictor sets, including socioeconomic, institutional, and environmental dimensions. Three climate adaptation and mitigation strategy groups adopted by farmers, including crop adjustment, nutrient management, and soil and water management practices, were subjected to binary logistic regression models. The core determinants of farmers' perception of climate variability included tropical livestock unit (TLU, p = 0.008), access to agricultural training (p = 0.022), change in agricultural production (p = 0.005), change in forest cover (p = 0.014), soil fertility status (p = 0.039), and perceptions of soil erosion (p = 0.001). Most farmers reported changes in all climatic indicators during the decade preceding the survey, including increasing temperature (80%), reduced precipitation (78%), and declining season lengths (76%). There were significant relationships between climate variability perceptions and coping strategies, with the soil and water management set showing stronger links with climate perceptions compared to crop adjustment and nutrient management strategies. Critical mitigation and adaptation strategies to cope with climate variability implemented by farmers included the use of fertilizer and manure in combination (71%), terracing (66%), and crop rotation (60%). Farmers' perceptions significantly determined the adoption of climate-smart agriculture technologies, and environmental determinants strongly influenced climate variability coping strategies. Therefore, while formulating climate sustainability-related policies, farmers' perceptions should be considered.",1
"Local governments are expected now more than ever to lead climate action planning as climate change intensifies and urbanization increases rapidly. However, studies indicate limitations in the comprehensiveness and level of integration of adaptation and mitigation in existing climate action plans. To develop suitable climate action plans that are comprehensive and consistent with globally accepted standards and benchmarks, this study proposed an Urban Climate Action Planning framework and pilot-tested it with 257 urban climate action plans. Overall, 43 criteria are included in the framework across three stages of climate planning. The pilot test revealed that more than half of the sampled plans have a medium level of suitability, with 39% having a weak level of suitability. About 51% of plans from Europe have a weak level of suitability. Surprisingly, none of the plans sampled from Africa and Latin America achieved a weak level of suitability despite lacking a significant share of global climate research and development funding. A Kruskal-Wallis test shows a statistically significant association between stages of climate planning and (a) city types (p-value of 0.004326) and (b) year of adoption or publication of climate plans and suitability scores (p-value of 0.0001027). Urban climate action plans adopted or published more recently (2018-2022) are likely more suitable than those adopted or published earlier. The sampled urban climate action plans from the Global South had higher average suitability scores than those from the Global North. The study presents key findings and considerations for urban climate action planning and future research.",1
"Assessments of adaptation options generally focus on incremental, homogeneous ecosystem responses to climate even though climate change impacts can be big, fast, and patchy across a region. Regional drought-induced tree die-off in semiarid woodlands highlights how an ecosystem crash fundamentally alters most ecosystem services and poses management challenges. Building on previous research showing how choice of location is linked to adaptive capacity and vulnerability, we developed a framework showing how the options for retaining desired ecosystem services in the face of sudden crashes depend on how portable the service is and whether the stakeholder is flexible with regard to the location where they receive their services. Stakeholders using portable services, or stakeholders who can move to other locations to obtain services, may be more resilient to ecosystem crashes. Our framework suggests that entering into cooperative networks with regionally distributed stakeholders is key to building resilience to big, fast, patchy crashes.",1
"Climate Adaptation Plans (CAPs) usually include a section on urban resilience, in which policymakers are expected to address human needs created or exacerbated by climate-related emergency events. However, the urban resilience sections of CAPs tend to remain under-developed, with welfare-related risks often overlooked. Until recently, there has been limited acknowledgement of the barriers preventing the positioning of human need at the core of CAPs. To conceptualize and understand the impact of such barriers, this study used an agenda-setting approach. We examined the incorporation of vulnerable populations' needs into CAPs drawn up by municipal authorities in Israel, using the COVID-19 pandemic as a prompt for the assessment of barriers to agenda setting and lessons learned. Drawing on twenty interviews with senior administrators in Israeli municipal authorities, we identified three administrative barriers hindering the integration of vulnerable populations' intensified needs into CAPs. The barriers were created by disparities between confidence in their succeesful emergency management and their knowledge of unmet needs; between acceptance of responsibility and access to training, resources or impact; and between local initiatives and reliance on national funds. Overlooking administrative barriers is bound to leave scholarly understanding of the slow pace at which CAPs translate lessons learned from human crises into policy, limited or lacking.",1
"Objectives: To assess changes in pulp blood flow (PBF) and pulp sensibility (PS) in teeth of patients with a history of dental trauma undergoing maxillary expansion.Materials and Methods: Twenty-five patients requiring rapid maxillary expansion (RME) had the pulp status of their maxillary anterior teeth assessed using laser Doppler flowmetry, electric pulp testing, and thermal testing (CO2 snow). Each patient was tested at T1 (prior to expansion), T2 (2 weeks after rapid expansion), and T3 (3 months after expansion). Relationships between PBF, time interval, and history of trauma were evaluated using linear mixed modelling.Results: Within the Trauma group, PBF was significantly lower (P <= .05) at T2 and T3 in comparison to T1 and significantly lower (P <= .05) at T2 in comparison to T3. In the Non-trauma group, PBF at T2 was significantly lower (P <= .05) than PBF at T1 and T3; however, no significant difference (P>.05) in PBF was observed when comparing PBF at T1 and T3. In both groups, PS was maintained in almost all teeth (>90%).Conclusions: RME in healthy teeth causes reduction of PBF before reestablishment of pretreatment values. RME in traumatized teeth causes reduction of PBF without PBF being reestablished to pretreatment levels. Teeth with a history of compromise may have reduced adaptive capacity under insults such as RME, which should be appreciated during the informed consent process.",0

"Cities have experienced rapid urbanization-induced harsh climatic events, especially flooding, inevitably resulting in negative and irreversible consequences for urban resilience and endangering residents' lives. Numerous studies have analyzed the effects of anthropogenic practices (land use changes and urbanization) on flood forecasting. However, non-structural mitigation's effectiveness, like Nature-Based Solutions (NBS), has yet to receive adequate attention, particularly in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, which have become increasingly significant and indispensable for operationalizing cities efficiently. Therefore, our study investigated the predictive influence of incorporating one of the most common NBS strategies called low-impact development tools (LID) (such as rain gardens, bio-retention cells, green roofs, infiltration trenches, permeable pavement, and vegetative swale) during the urban planning of Alexandria, Egypt, which experiences the harshest rainfall annually and includes various urban patterns. City characteristics-dependent 14 LID scenarios were simulated with recurrence intervals ranging from 2 to 100 years using the LID Treatment Train Tool (LID TTT), depending on calibrated data from 2015 to 2020, by the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency index and deterministic coefficient, and root-mean-square error with values of 0.97, 0.91, and 0.31, respectively. Our findings confirmed the significant effectiveness of combined LID tools on total flood runoff volume reduction by 73.7%, revealing that different urban patterns can be used in flood-prone cities, provided LID tools are considered in city planning besides grey infrastructure to achieve optimal mitigation. These results, which combined multiple disciplines and were not explicitly mentioned in similar studies in developing countries, may assist municipalities' policymakers in planning flood-resistant, sustainable cities.",1
"This study constructed and evaluated the livelihood vulnerability index of small scale tea farming households in Lam Dong Province. It then determined the factors that can increase or reduce their vulnerability. The vulnerability to stresses of weather, climate, production linkages, and product consumption was viewed as a function of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. The results showed that most of the households had very high exposure indices to changes in weather, climate, and natural conditions, showing that tea farming activities depended immensely on nature. The sensitivity to pressures of livelihoods, product consumption, or damages from climate variability was moderate. Tea farming households in Lam Dong province had relatively low adaptive capacity indices. The composite vulnerability index was calculated and provided an average of 0.56. The moderately vulnerable group comprised of 71 households (equal to 26.3% of the sample), the highly vulnerable group had 198 households (73.3%), and the extremely vulnerable group had one household (0.4%). The regression model revealed that risk-dependent livelihood, poverty, receiving support from acquaintances or the local government could worsen the vulnerability, while training and production experience can help lessen it.",1

"The purpose of this study is to identify types of adaptation strategies used by unskilled migrant workers living in South Korea as they acculturated to life in the country and to determine specific characteristics by acculturation patterns. To this end, a Q methodology was used. A total of fifty-nine statements were drawn through in-depth interviews with eight migrant workers and two South Koreans working in related organizations as well as from thirteen other studies, and four factor types of acculturation patterns were identified by conducting a Q sorting on thirty-eight subjects. Interpretation of the study revealed that the subjects used four types of adaptation strategies: accepted separation, compromising integration, conflict marginalization, and harmonious assimilation. The subjects in each type showed concrete socio-psychological adaptation strategies in response to South Korea's unique culture and policies of discriminative exclusion.",0
"The need to design measures for adapting to climate change is increasingly recognized as important and has encouraged research on the role of local ecological knowledge (LEK) in supporting adaptation. Studies of how LEK can help adapt to increasing climate variability remain limited. This article develops an approach through which the process of adaptation can be tracked at a community level.We describe how community residents in the Amazon floodplains incorporate natural hydrologic and ecological processes into their management systems to optimize ecosystem functioning. We describe two case studies where LEK is used as a resource by small-scale fisher-farmers in the Amazon floodplains to adapt to the increasing impacts on their livelihoods generated by changing climate patterns. This article draws on local histories and seeks to identify the critical factors that either facilitate or impede household ability to reduce their vulnerability. We found that the LEK of small fisher-farmers has facilitated the adaptation of a resource management system to optimize production across a broad range of floodplain habitats and conditions. There are, however, significant challenges to operationalizing these approaches, including an absence of systematically collected data on adaptation strategies and outcomes. In addition, local people must be integrated into policymaking processes so their knowledge can contribute to the design of locally appropriate policies for adapting to-the impacts of climate related events.

"Bangladesh is one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world. In particular, its riverine-island (char) dwellers face continuous riverbank erosion, frequent flooding, and other adverse effects of climate change that increase their vulnerability. This paper aims to assess the livelihood vulnerability of riverine communities by applying the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) vulnerability framework and the livelihood vulnerability index (LVI). Results indicate substantial variation in the vulnerability of char dwellers based on mainland proximity. The main drivers of livelihood vulnerability are char-dweller adaptation strategies and access to food and health services. The study further reveals that riverbank erosion, frequent flood inundation, and lack of employment and access to basic public services are the major social and natural drivers of livelihood vulnerability. Char-based policy focusing on short- and long-term strategy is required to reduce livelihood vulnerability and enhance char-dweller resilience.",1
"The mixed salt stress is common in nature. Salt stress always affects plant growth. Different plant species have different adaptive capacity to salty soils. Leymus chinensis is an herbaceous plant with different leaf colors. However, little research was conducted to explore the different tolerance mechanisms to salt stress among the three different leaf colour genotypes of Leymus chinensis (grey green, transitional color, yellow green). Pot experiments for Leymus chinensis in three leaf colors were conducted under mixed salt treatments in 2010. Malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein concentrations, and the activity of various antioxidant enzymes [i.e., superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), glutathione reductase (GR), dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR) and monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR)] were determined and compared among the three leaf color genotypes of Leymus chinensis. The concentrations of MDA and protein, and the activity of antioxidant enzymes showed an increasing trend with increasing pHs in almost all three leaf colors, and all of them became highest when salt stress and pH values were also highest. Moreover, antioxidant enzymes were the highest in the grey-green leaf color, and the lowest in the yellow green leaf color after exposure to the same pH treatment. The results suggested that all three leaf colors of Leymus chinensis were tolerant to salt stress, and the salt-tolerance declined according to the order of grey green > transitional color > yellow green of Leymus chinensis. This study can give us a better understanding of the intra-species adaptation to mixed salt soils.",0

"Drought and heat are major abiotic stresses that significantly reduce crop yield and seed quality. In this study, we examined the impact of heat, drought and combined effect of heat and drought stress imposed during the grain filling stage in 18 US spring barley varieties. These impacts were assessed based on dry biomass, seed yield and six important malting quality traits, namely, beta-glucan, free amino nitrogen, soluble protein, refractive index, diastatic power and alpha-amylase activity. Singly applied heat or drought stress evoked a diverse set of responses among these varieties with respect to biomass, seed yield and malt quality traits suggesting these varieties can be exploited for enhancing barley production based on local conditions. Majority of the tested varieties performed poorly with reference to seed yield when the stresses were applied in combination, suggesting a lack of genetic diversity in the currently grown spring barley varieties to overcome co-occurring episodic drought and heat regimes, especially during heading stages. In the wake of global climate change, enhancing adaptive capacity of barley varieties by introducing novel germplasm into breeding programs or via new technologies is vital to sustain US barley production and meet the demands of the rapidly growing brewing industry.

"This paper describes a comparative study of four different cases on vulnerability, hazards and adaptive capacity to climate threats in coastal areas and communities in four developing countries: Bangladesh, Brazil, Cameroon and Uruguay. Coastal areas are vulnerable to sea-level rise (SLR), storm surges and flooding due to their (i) exposure, (ii) concentration of settlements, many of which occupied by less advantaged groups and (iii) the concentration of assets and services seen in these areas. The objective of the paper is twofold: (i) to evaluate current evidence of coastal vulnerability and adaptive capacity and (ii) to compare adaptation strategies being implemented in a sample of developing countries, focusing on successful ones. The followed approach for the case evaluation is based on (i) documenting observed threats and damages, (ii) using indicators of physical and socioeconomic vulnerability and adaptive capacity status and (iii) selecting examples of successful responses. Major conclusions based on cross-case comparison are (a) the studied countries show different vulnerability, adaptive capacity and implementation of responses, (b) innovative community-based (CBA) and ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) and (c) early warning systems are key approaches and tools to foster climate resilience. A recommendation to foster the resilience of coastal communities and services is that efforts in innovative adaptation strategies to sea-level rise should be intensified and integrated with climate risk management within the national adaption plans (NAPAs) in order to reduce the impacts of hazards.",1
"The aim of this study is to lay a framework for evaluating flood vulnerabilities. Specifically, it applies the proposed methodology to evaluate flood vulnerability index (FVI) across 21 districts comprising a significantly large part (drainage area of 85 859 km(2)) of Narmada River basin in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. The study assesses sensitivity, adaptive capacity indices, and the exposure risk over a chosen set of 22 climatic, demographic, social and economic parameters, and applies principal component analysis to evolve a composite FVI. The results rank various districts for their vulnerabilities to floods. The analysis indicates that, in the study area, around a third of the vulnerability is accounted by two factors: a lack of adaptive capacity of the community and heightened sensitivity to floods. There exists significant scope to modify these two factors by appropriate policy interventions at the social and economic levels. It is expected that the framework would be of use to stakeholders such as planners, policymakers, flood management authorities, field engineers, district administration and local non-governmental organisations who strive to make the community less vulnerable to floods.",1
"Background: The association between heat and daily mortality and its temporal variation are well known. However, few studies have analyzed the inter-annual variations in both the risk estimates and impacts of heat The aim is to estimate inter-annual variations in the effect of heat for a fixed temperature range, on mortality in 9 European cities included in the PHASE (Public Health Adaptation Strategies to Extreme weather events) project for the period 1990-2010. The second aim is to evaluate overall summer effects and heat-attributable deaths for each year included in the study period, considering the entire air temperature range (both mild and extreme temperatures).Methods: A city-specific daily time-series analysis was performed, using a generalized additive Poisson regression model, restricted to the warm season (April-September). To study the temporal variation for a fixed air temperature range, a Bayesian Change Point analysis was applied to the relative risks of mortality for a 2 degrees C increase over the 90th percentile of the city-specific distribution. The number of heat attributable deaths in each summer were also calculated for mild (reference to 95th percentile) and extreme heat (95th percentile to maximum value).Results: A decline in the effects of heat over time was observed in Athens and Rome when considering a fixed interval, while an increase in effects was observed in Helsinki. The greatest impact of heat in terms of attributable deaths was observed in the Mediterranean cities (Athens, Barcelona and Rome) for extreme air temperatures. In the other cities the impact was mostly related to extreme years with 2003 as a record breaking year in Paris (+ 1900 deaths) and London (+ 1200 deaths).Conclusions: Monitoring the impact of heat over time is important to identify changes in population vulnerability and evaluate adaptation measures.",1

"Water uptake and water use efficiency of poikilochlorophyllous resurrection plants considerably differ from other vascular plants due to their special ecological adaptation strategies. Histological traits of the living and dead leaves of desiccation-tolerant Xerophyta scabrida (Pax) Th., Dur. et Schinz. were investigated after safranin staining to examine the dynamics of rehydration and the process of water transport by safranin impregnation differences. Staining that appeared on the leaf's surface epidermal glands after 30 min of remoistening in living X. scabrida leaves suggested that glandular complexes could take part in the water uptake from the beginning of the rehydration process, when the xylem might not have been filled up, yet. The leaves of living X scabrida became fully impregnated faster than the dead leaves: Sclerenchyma staining started from the xylem while dead X. scabrida leaves were not able to rehydrate fully. The dynamics of rehydration by the orientation of immersing leaves was also studied. Leaves immersed into the solution with their base downward became fully impregnated earlier than the leaves sank into the dye with their apex downward. Faster water supply in the former case might have been related to the earlier recovery of xylem integrity and the resultant spatially continuous water supply. The results indicate that the living leaves of desiccation-tolerant X. scabrida were able to uptake significant water amount not only (and not primarily) through their vascular tissues but by external water conduction. Due to the specific binding of safranin to lignifying cell walls and its fast spread from the xylem to the sclerenchymatous bundle sheaths also confirm the potential role of sclerenchyma in the water movement of leaf tissues.

"Climate change tends to negatively affect the power sector, inter alia, by causing cooling problems in power plants and impairing the water supply required for hydropower generation. In the future, when global warming is expected to increase, autonomous adaptation to climate change via international electricity markets inducing reallocations of power generation may not be sufficient to prevent supply disruptions anymore. Furthermore, the consequent changes of supply patterns and electricity prices might cause an undesirable redistribution of wealth both between individual power suppliers and between suppliers and consumers. This study ascertains changes in European power supply patterns and electricity prices caused by on-going global warming as well as the associated redistribution of wealth for different climate change scenarios. The focus of the analysis is on short-term effects. Our results confirm that autonomous adaptation in the power sector should be complemented by planned public adaptation in order to preserve energy security and to prevent undesired distributional effects.",1
"Water stress in many regions is a consequence of precipitation that is spatially and temporally distant and the cumulative effects of withdrawals, inter-basin transfers, and reservoirs. Most maps of water risk  do not account for the role of infrastructure and rely on local runoff metrics, which may be a poor proxy for experienced water stress. We present a new spatial and multi-sectoral optimization model of resource networks, applied here to water resources in the United States. The model, AWASH, includes a detailed representation of surface water and reservoirs, and relates water risk directly to failures to meet water demand as a function of climate. We find that considering the role of water conveyance and storage infrastructure in managing supply leads to a radically different picture of water risk, with substantial reductions due to both types of infrastructure - up to 60% reduction in risk due to conveyance and 38% due to storage. This highlights the importance of accounting of the role of infrastructure in national climate risk assessment and adaptation strategies.",1
"Abstract Industrial areas located in the west of Vitoria-Gasteiz caused ecological fragmentation in the territory due to their rapid urban growth. The area of work (Mendebaldea 30 ha) had derelict and polluted soils before the intervention, lacking of any public use or activity. The Vitoria-Gasteiz City Council, the University of the Basque Country and the Neiker-Tecnalia Research Center proposed the restoration of the area by using nature-based solutions to create a large green infrastructure that would provide several environmental benefits such as climate change mitigation, soil recovery and landscape restoration. The project was developed over 6 years (10 hectares restored every 2 years) including: soil and forest carbon sinks through organic amendments and plantings, artificial ponds for biodiversity, green water filters and pathways network. For soil decontamination, phytoremediation was used combining organic amendments and agroforestry systems due to the participation in the European phytoremediation projects PhytoSudoe and Phy2Sudoe. The project test plots are being monitored in the long term with the help of public participation, offering a demonstration space for learning new soil remediation techniques.",1

"Maple syrup is an important non-timber forest product derived from the sap of the sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marshall). However, maple syrup producers are facing a diversity of challenges, including: potential range shifts in the maple resource; increasing variability in the timing, duration and yield of sap flow and syrup operations; invasive species, pests and diseases; and intergenerational land and business transfer challenges. Members of Maple Syrup Producer Associations in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan were surveyed to learn about their operations, adaptation strategies, concerns, and information needs. While many respondents indicated they have undertaken or plan to undertake adaptation activities, only 11% had done so out of specific concern over changing climate conditions. Climate-motivated activities included: being prepared to tap earlier and utilizing newer technology such as vacuum tubing or reverse osmosis to enhance sap collection and processing efficiency. Respondents were generally unlikely to consider planting climate-resilient maple cultivars or tapping trees other than sugar maple. They expressed the greatest concerns over tree health and forest pests, as well as their physical ability and family member interest to continue their operations. Boil season variability and weather issues were viewed with less concern. Respondents were generally optimistic that they can adapt to future conditions, likely in large measure through the adoption of new technologies, and they expect their syrup production levels to slightly increase in the future. If future climate scenarios play out, however, additional planning and adaptation strategies may be called for, particularly as they relate to forest health and productivity issues.",1
"This paper examines climate change adaptation and gender issues through an application of a feminist intersectional approach. This approach permits the identification of diverse adaptation responses arising from the existence of multiple and fragmented dimensions of identity (including gender) that intersect with power relations to shape situation-specific interactions between farmers and ecosystems. Based on results from contrasting research cases in Bihar and Uttarakhand, India, this paper demonstrates, inter alia, that there are geographically determined gendered preferences and adoption strategies regarding adaptation options and that these are influenced by the socio-ecological context and institutional dynamics. Intersecting identities, such as caste, wealth, age and gender, influence decisions and reveal power dynamics and negotiation within the household and the community, as well as barriers to adaptation among groups. Overall, the findings suggest that a feminist intersectional approach does appear to be useful and worth further exploration in the context of climate change adaptation. In particular, future research could benefit from more emphasis on a nuanced analysis of the intra-gender differences that shape adaptive capacity to climate change.",1
"Background Crossbreeding is an important way to improve production beef cattle performance. Pinan cattle is a new hybrid cattle obtained from crossing Piedmontese bulls with Nanyang cows. After more than 30 years of cross-breeding, Pinan cattle show a variety of excellent characteristics, including fast growth, early onset of puberty, and good meat quality. In this study, we analyzed the genetic diversity, population structure, and genomic region under the selection of Pinan cattle based on whole-genome sequencing data of 30 Pinan cattle and 169 published cattle genomic data worldwide. Results Estimating ancestry composition analysis showed that the composition proportions for our Pinan cattle were mainly Piedmontese and a small amount of Nanyang cattle. The analyses of nucleotide diversity and linkage disequilibrium decay indicated that the genomic diversity of Pinan cattle was higher than that of European cattle and lower than that of Chinese indigenous cattle. De-correlated composite of multiple selection signals, which combines four different statistics including theta pi, CLR, F-ST, and XP-EHH, was computed to detect the signatures of selection in the Pinan cattle genome. A total of 83 genes were identified, affecting many economically important traits. Functional annotation revealed that these selected genes were related to immune (BOLA-DQA2, BOLA-DQB, LSM14A, SEC13, and NAALADL2), growth traits (CYP4A11, RPL26, and MYH10), embryo development (REV3L, NT5E, CDX2, KDM6B, and ADAMTS9), hornless traits (C1H21orf62), and climate adaptation (ANTXR2). Conclusion In this paper, we elucidated the genomic characteristics, ancestry composition, and selective signals related to important economic traits in Pinan cattle. These results will provide the basis for further genetic improvement of Pinan cattle and reference for other hybrid cattle related studies.",1
"The North Western Mediterranean basin (NWMB) is characterised by a highly complex topography and an important variability of temperature and precipitation patterns. Downscaling techniques are required to capture these features, identify the most vulnerable areas to extreme changes and help decision makers to design strategies of mitigation and adaptation to climate change. A Regional Climate Model, WRF-ARW, is used to downscale the IPCC-AR4 ECHAM5/MPI-OM General Circulation Model results with high resolution (10 km), considering three different emissions scenarios (B1, A1B and A2) for 2001-2050. Model skills to reproduce observed extremes are assessed for a control period, 1971-2000, using the ERA40 reanalysis to drive the WRF-ARW simulations. A representative set of indices for temperature and precipitation extremes is projected. The modelling system correctly reproduces amplitude and frequency of extremes and provides a high degree of detail on variability over neighbouring areas. However, it tends to overestimate the persistence of wet events and consequently slightly underestimate the length of dry periods. Drier and hotter conditions are generally projected for the NWMB, with significant increases in the duration of droughts and the occurrence of heavy precipitation events. The projected increase in the number of tropical nights and extreme temperatures could have a negative effect on human health and comfort conditions. Simulations allow defining specifically vulnerable areas, such as the Ebro Valley or the Pyrenees, and foreseeing impacts on socio-economic activities in the region.",1
"The competitive and adaptive capacity of Cochliobolus sativus were determined using the two major pathotypes in populations on barley in Syria Pt1 and Pt4, which differed widely in their virulence. Following greenhouse co-inoculation with the two pathotypes, Pt4 frequency average increased from the first to the last of four infection cycles, but decreased for Pt1. The number of lesions caused by Pt4 was individually higher than their mixture on both barley cultivars, Bowman and WI 2291. Moreover, the number of lesions was increased over the four cycles on both cultivars. The results suggest that isolates of different pathotypes would adapt at different rates in a mixed environment due to competitive advantage imposed by their virulence properties.",0
"The Baltic Sea is a shallow basin of brackish water in which the spatial salinity gradient is one of the most important factors contributing to species distribution. The Baltic Sea is infamous for its annual cyanobacterial blooms comprised of Nodularia spumigena, Aphanizomenon spp., and Dolichospermum spp. that cause harm, especially for recreational users. To broaden our knowledge of the cyanobacterial adaptation strategies for brackish water environments, we sequenced the entire genome of Dolichospermum sp. UHCC 0315, a species occurring not only in freshwater environments but also in brackish water. Comparative genomics analyses revealed a close association with Dolichospermum sp. UHCC 0090 isolated from a lake in Finland. The genome closure of Dolichospermum sp. UHCC 0315 unraveled a mixture of two subtypes in the original culture, and subtypes exhibited distinct buoyancy phenotypes. Salinity less than 3 g L-1 NaCl enabled proper growth of Dolichospermum sp. UHCC 0315, whereas growth was arrested at moderate salinity (6 g L-1 NaCl). The concentrations of toxins, microcystins, increased at moderate salinity, whereas RNA sequencing data implied that Dolichospermum remodeled its primary metabolism in unfavorable high salinity. Based on our results, the predicted salinity decrease in the Baltic Sea may favor toxic blooms of Dolichospermum spp.",0

"Populus fremontii (Fremont cottonwood) is recognized as one of the most important foundation tree species in the southwestern USA and northern Mexico because of its ability to structure communities across multiple trophic levels, drive ecosystem processes and influence biodiversity via genetic-based functional trait variation. However, the areal extent of P. fremontii cover has declined dramatically over the last century due to the effects of surface water diversions, non-native species invasions and more recently climate change. Consequently, P. fremontii gallery forests are considered amongst the most threatened forest types in North America. In this paper, we unify four conceptual areas of genes to ecosystems research related to P. fremontii's capacity to survive or even thrive under current and future environmental conditions: (i) hydraulic function related to canopy thermal regulation during heat waves; (ii) mycorrhizal mutualists in relation to resiliency to climate change and invasion by the non-native tree/shrub, Tamarix; (iii) phenotypic plasticity as a mechanism for coping with rapid changes in climate; and (iv) hybridization between P. fremontii and other closely related Populus species where enhanced vigour of hybrids may preserve the foundational capacity of Populus in the face of environmental change. We also discuss opportunities to scale these conceptual areas from genes to the ecosystem level via remote sensing. We anticipate that the exploration of these conceptual areas of research will facilitate solutions to climate change with a foundation species that is recognized as being critically important for biodiversity conservation and could serve as a model for adaptive management of arid regions in the southwestern USA and around the world.",1

"With the advances in middleware and Web set-vices technologies, network services are evolving from simple client-server applications to self-configuring services that can compose primitive components distributed in the Internet into a value-added service configuration that provides rich functionalities to users. A resulting research problem is how to continuously adapt such composite service configurations at run time in order to cope with the increasingly dynamic and heterogeneous network environments and computing platforms. In this paper, we propose a self-adaptation architecture that allows service developers to specify their service-specific adaptation knowledge as externalized adaptation strategies. These adaptation strategies are used by a general, shared adaptation framework to perform run-time adaptation operations that automatically incorporate service-specific knowledge. In addition to the strategies, we also identify another aspect of adaptation knowledge that is not addressed by previous solutions: adaptation coordination. Our framework provides integrated support for the specification and execution of both aspects of developers' adaptation knowledge.",0
"In recent years, an increasing number of local governments are recognizing the impact of climate change on different urban sectors. This has led many to pursue climate adaptation planning, seeking to achieve preparedness through reducing vulnerability and enhancing resilience of populations, assets, and municipal operations. Although cities typically share these common goals, many are electing to pursue different planning approaches. In this paper, we examine three climate adaptation planning approaches in the cities of Quito (Ecuador), Surat (India), and Durban (South Africa) and analyze the trade-offs associated with different planning pathways and different forms of stakeholder involvement. We assess the potentials and limitations of these different approaches, including their implications for enhancing government integration and coordination, promoting participation and adaptive capacity of vulnerable groups, and facilitating overall urban resilience. We find that, in order to gain widespread commitment on adaptation, sustained political leadership from the top, departmental engagement, and continued involvement from a variety of stakeholders are integral to effective decision-making and institutionalization of programs in the long run. When climate adaptation is advanced with a focus on learning, awareness, and capacity building, the process will likely lead to more sustained, legitimate, and comprehensive adaptation plans and policies that enhance the resilience of the most affected urban areas and residents.

"Climate change and related ocean warming have affected marine ecological and socioeconomic systems worldwide. Therefore, it is critically important to assess the performance of conservation mechanisms, particularly marine protected areas (MPAs) to moderate the risks of climate-related impacts. In this study, sea surface temperature trends of Australian Commonwealth MPAs are assessed against climate change management criteria, as defined in Adapting to Climate Change: Guidance for Protected Area Managers and Planners. Monthly sea surface temperature trends between 1993 and 2017 were statistically assessed using the Mann-Kendall trend test and management plans were subject to a thematic analysis. Temperature trends showed variable SST changes among the regions, with the northern reserves all showing statistically significant increases in temperature, and the Southwest Network having the least number of reserves with statistically significant increases in temperature. The thematic analysis shows that management plans address approximately half of the climate change adaptation criteria. Several management strategies, such as dynamic MPAs, replication, and translocations, are currently absent and have been suggested as necessary tools in supporting the climate readiness of Australian MPAs. This study is significant because it helps to identify and synthesize regions most vulnerable to the impacts of ocean warming and provides management suggestions make MPAs climate ready.",1

"Anomalies in the frequency of river floods, i.e., flood-rich or -poor periods, cause biases in flood risk estimates and thus make climate adaptation measures less efficient. While observations have recently confirmed the presence of flood anomalies in Europe, their exact causes are not clear. Here we analyse streamflow and climate observations during 1960-2010 to show that shifts in flood generation processes contribute more to the occurrence of regional flood anomalies than changes in extreme rainfall. A shift from rain on dry soil to rain on wet soil events by 5% increased the frequency of flood-rich periods in the Atlantic region, and an opposite shift in the Mediterranean region increased the frequency of flood-poor periods, but will likely make singular extreme floods occur more often. Flood anomalies driven by changing flood generation processes in Europe may further intensify in a warming climate and should be considered in flood estimation and management.Changes in the processes that can generate floods, such as rain falling on wet rather than dry soil, affect the occurrence of regional floods more than changes in extreme rainfall, according to an analysis of flood anomalies observed in Europe combined with a flood process typology.",1
"This article examines the factors shaping the perception of climate change and the relationship between climate change perception and migration. Drawing on a 691-case survey of climate perceptions in Cambodia, it explores three dimensions of climate change perception. The first is the relationship of climate change perceptions to space, geography, and scale. Second is the influence of livelihoods to climate change perceptions, and third is the relationship of climate perceptions to migration. The results show that perceptions of climate change are not significantly influenced by spatial distance, meaning that divergent or even opposite climate perceptions might coexist within a relatively small geographical area. The data, however, show that climate perceptions are significantly influenced by both engagement in certain primary livelihoods and contextually specified socioeconomic marginality. Despite this subjectivity of climate perceptions, a strong, statistically significant relationship exists between climate change perception and the prevalence of migrants in the household. Overarchingly, the article challenges efforts to infer direct linkages between climate data and human behavior, arguing instead for a more subjectively attuned understanding of the impacts of climate change on migration, to account for the multiple factors that influence perceptions of and responses to climate change.",1
"Green and blue infrastructure, nature-based solutions, and cultural and built heritage play a key role in enhancing ecosystem services provision and shaping urban quality and communities' wellbeing calling for an integrated approach to ecosystem services in urban policy and planning and decision-making. On the other side, under-used spaces and buildings have social, cultural, economic, as well as ecological functions and benefits, which are essential to sustainable urban development. The EU has been developing and implementing policies for an integrated approach to urban development and sustainable land use through the implementation of the Urban Agenda for the EU and fourteen associated Partnerships. Thus, it engaged a broad range of institutions and stakeholders across Europe in promoting local projects and sharing best practices on sustainable land use and nature-based solutions, the circular economy, and cultural heritage. This paper reviews the experiences of cities involved in the Partnerships of the Urban Agenda for the EU by illustrating how they related to different modes of ecosystem governance and associated challenges, discussing how three case studies integrate different dimensions of ecosystem services and regeneration in under-used areas and what type of knowledge as well as regulation and governance modes they have developed for supporting innovation in land use planning and management for urban ecosystem services. The results show that appropriate alternative regulations and policies are little explored and that cities adopt an integrated approach, combining cultural, environmental, economic, and social dimensions in their interventions, directly or indirectly enhancing the benefits of built and natural heritage and urban ecosystems in under-used areas. However, some issues, such as nature-based solutions and climate change, are still partially integrated into the projects while priority is given to the cultural, aesthetic, and economic dimensions.",1
"For the 2nd and 3rd river basin management cycles (2015-2027) of the Water Framework Directive (WFD), EU Member States are required to fully integrate climate change into the process of river basin management planning (RBMP). Complying with the main WFD objective of achieving 'good ecological status' in all water bodies in Denmark requires Programmes of Measures (PoMs) to reduce nitrogen (N) pollution from point and diffuse sources. Denmark is among the world's most intensively farmed countries and in spite of thirty years of significant policy actions to reduce diffuse nutrient emissions, there is still a need for further reductions. In addition, the impacts of climate change are projected to lead to a situation where nutrient loads will have to be reduced still further in comparison to current climate conditions. There is an urgent need to address this challenge in WFD action programmes in order to develop robust and cost-effective adaptation strategies for the next WFD RBMP cycles. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate and discuss how a map-based PoMs assessment tool can support the development of adaptive and cost-effective strategies to reduce N losses in the Isefjord and Roskilde Fjord River Basin in the north east of Denmark. The tool facilitates assessments of the application of agri-environmental measures that are targeted towards low retention agricultural areas, where limited or no surface and subsurface N reduction takes place. Effects of climate change on nitrate leaching were evaluated using the dynamic agro-ecosystem model 'Daisy'. Results show that nitrate leaching rates increase by approx. 25% under current management practices. This impact outweighs the expected total N reduction effect of Baseline 2015 and the first RBMP in the case study river basin. The particular PoMs investigated in our study show that WFD N reduction targets can be achieved by targeted land use changes on approx. 4% of the agricultural area under current climate conditions and approx. 9% of the agricultural area, when projected climate change impacts on nitrate leaching rates are included in the assessment. The study highlights the potential of the PoMs assessment tool to assist in evaluation of alternative WFD RBMP scenarios to achieve spatially targeted and cost-effective reductions of N loads at catchment scale in the context of a changing climate.

"The ixodid tick Haemaphysalis concinna Koch, 1844 is a proven vector of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus and Francisella tularensis, the causative agent of tularaemia. In the present study, up-to-date maps depicting the geographical distribution and climate adaptation of H. concinna are presented. A dataset was compiled, resulting in 656 georeferenced locations in Eurasia. The distribution of H. concinna ranges from the Spanish Atlantic coast to Kamchatka, Russia, within the belt of 28-64 degrees N latitude. H. concinna is the second most abundant tick species after Ixodes ricinus collected from birds, and third most abundant tick species flagged from vegetation in Central Europe. To investigate the climate adaptation of H. concinna, the georeferenced locations were superimposed on a high-resolution map of the Koppen-Geiger climate classification. A frequency distribution of the H. concinna occurrence under different climates shows three peaks related to the following climates: warm temperate with precipitation all year round, boreal with precipitation all year round and boreal, winter dry. Almost 87.3 % of all H. concinna locations collected are related to these climates. Thus, H. concinna prefers climates with a warm and moist summer. The remaining tick locations were characterized as cold steppes (6.2%), cold deserts (0.8%), Mediterranean climates (2.7%) or warm temperate climates with dry winter (2.9%). In those latter climates H. concinna occurs only sporadically, provided the microclimate is favourable. Beyond proven vector competence pathogen findings in questing H. concinna are compiled from the literature.",0

"Recent high impact wildfires and droughts in California and Nevada have been linked to extremes in the Evaporative Demand Drought Index (EDDI) and Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), respectively. Both indices are dependent on reference evapotranspiration (ET0). Future changes in ET0 for California and Nevada are examined, calculated from global climate model simulations downscaled by Localized Constructed Analogs (LOCA). ET0 increases of 13-18% at seasonal timescales are projected by late century (2070-2099), with greatest relative increases in winter and spring. Seasonal ET0 increases are most strongly driven by warmer temperatures, with increasing specific humidity having a smaller, but noteworthy, counter tendency. Extreme (95th percentile) EDDI values on the 2-week timescale have coincided with recent large wildfires in the area. Two-week EDDI extremes are projected to increase by 6-10 times during summer and 4-6 times during autumn by the end of the century. On multiyear timescales, the occurrence of extreme droughts based on 3-year SPEI below the historical fifth percentile, similar to that experienced during the 2012-2016 drought across the region, is projected to increase 3-15 times by late century. Positive trends in extreme multiyear droughts will further increase seasonal fire potential through degraded forests and increased fuel loads and flammability. Understanding how these drought metrics change on various climate timescales at the local level can provide fundamental information to support the development of long-term adaptation strategies for wildland fire and water resource management.",1
"Impacts of climate change adaptation strategies need to be evaluated using principled methods spanning sectors and longer time frames. We propose machine-learning approaches to study the long-term impacts of flood protection in Bangladesh. Available data include socio-economic survey and events data (death, migration, etc.) from 1983-2014. These multidecadal data, rare in their extent and quality, provide a basis for using machine-learning approaches even though the data were not collected or designed to assess the impact of the flood control investments. We test whether the embankment has affected the welfare of people over time, benefiting those living inside more than those living outside. Machine-learning approaches enable learning patterns in data to help discriminate between two groups: here households living inside vs. outside. They also help identify the most informative indicators of discrimination and provide robust metrics to evaluate the quality of the model. Overall, we find no significant difference between inside/outside populations based on welfare, migration, or mortality indicators. However, we note a significant difference in inward/outward movement with respect to the embankment. While certain data gaps and spatial heterogeneity in sampled populations suggest caution in any conclusive interpretation of the flood protection infrastructure, we do not see higher benefits accruing to those living with higher levels of protection. This has implications for Bangladesh's planning for future and more extreme climate futures, including the national Delta Plan, and global investments in climate resilient infrastructure to create positive social impacts.",1
"Simple Summary Livestock breeds represent the diversity of livestock animals. They participate in the delivery of ecosystem services (ES), i.e., the benefits to humans provided by nature. In recent years, the contribution of livestock breeds to ES has received attention in livestock research. Additionally, there is increasing interest in integrating this knowledge into policies to make agriculture more sustainable. In this work, we elaborate on livestock breed characteristics that are key to the study of livestock breed contributions to ES. Thus, we explore the natural and human factors that have produced livestock breeds as ecologically and culturally mediated entities. In addition, we review the different roles of livestock breeds as biodiversity components. Finally, we examine how livestock breeds participate in livestock system heterogeneity. By integrating these aspects, we might better understand how livestock breeds provide and modulate ES provision and, therefore, how to improve breed conservation and livestock policies toward more sustainable farming. There is an increasing interest in assessing livestock breed contributions to ecosystem services (ES) and including this knowledge in decision making. However, this task has been limited due to the complexity of the multidimensional relationship between livestock diversity and ecosystem services. In this work, we elaborate on the livestock breed characteristics central to developing a comprehensive approach to livestock breed inclusion in the ecosystem services framework. Thus, we explore the multidimensional nature of livestock breeds, i.e., as eco-cultural entities, biodiversity components, and drivers of livestock system heterogeneity and functioning. First, anthropogenic and natural factors have acted jointly to develop breeds as eco-cultural entities. This fact represents an opportunity to move toward farming system sustainability by Nature-Based Solutions and Nature's Contribution to People paradigms. Second, livestock breeds are components of biodiversity, and as such, can be framed as goods, as final ecosystem services, and as regulators of ecosystem processes. Third, livestock breeds contribute to livestock system heterogeneity and resilience. By integrating these aspects, we might better understand how livestock breeds provide and modulate ecosystem service provision and, therefore, how to improve breed conservation and livestock policies toward farming system sustainability.",1

"Despite significant engagement with new and emerging issues in public health practice, the public health literature has few theoretical explanations for how new practices emerge, take root, and become institutionalized. In this contribution, we utilize Pierre Bourdieu?s sociological concepts of field, habitus and capital, and in-depth interviews with public health practitioners to document and describe the emerging field of public health adaptation to climate change Ontario, Canada. In doing so, we identify and explain three types of climate change action and associated practices ? ?wait and see?, repackaging existing actions and championing new actions ? that practitioners relate to climate change adaptation in Ontario (i.e. business as usual, repackaging existing actions and championing climate new actions). We discuss the typology in relation to the dominant and emerging logics that practitioners ascribe to promoting practical action on this sub-field of environmental health practice to promote a discussion of how social change occurs within a well-established field of professional practice. Findings suggest, that change and innovation can result from exogenous shocks that force practitioners to adopt new practices (e.g. the increasing frequency and intensity of climate-related impacts on health), how the ?rules? of a given field are interpreted by practitioners and made actionable, and through the negotiation of new rules by practitioners with a ?radical habitus? who champion particular issues, albeit resulting in significant professional risk. We discuss these findings in relation to Bourdieu?s theory, concluding there is significant room for practitioner agency to cultivate normative dispositions and influence the adoption of policy and practice-change.",1
"Accelerating climate change from the thermal expansion of oceans and losses from terrestrial glaciers and ice sheets causes sea level rise (SLR), damaging coastal ecosystems and generating non-market value losses. Using an innovative Artificial Intelligence (AI) projection method and 18 existing geographical SLR projections, we project future sea level rise and storm surge (SLR/S) for the 1600 km coastline of the Kimberley Region, Western Australia, a region with a larger surface area than Great Britain, Ireland, and Portugal combined and with a permanent population of 40,000 people of which more than 16,000 identify as Indigenous. Using our projected coastal area inundation from future SLR, we estimated the non-market value losses of the Kimberley's coastal ecosystem and wetlands with projected SLR/S to 2050 and 2100 for Representative Concentration Pathway (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5. Average annual non-market losses from SLR/S in 2050 and 2100 in the Kimberley are large relative to the size of the regional economy and are estimated to range from A$2.7 to A$4.3 billion (2050) and A $8.1 to A$15.8 billion (2100), depending on the RCP and temperature pathway. Our findings highlight the need for adequately resourced community-based approaches to climate adaptation.",1

"The main goal of this research is the proposal of an integrated approach, considering sustainability indicators related to energy life cycle of the building, for evaluation of energy efficiency measures with adaptation to climate change in Brazilian social housing projects. A Sustainability Index in the Energy Life Cycle was proposed that includes indicators associated to environmental, energy, economic aspects and user thermal comfort. A case study applied in the city of Sao Paulo, considered a representative project of the sector and cases with energy efficiency adaptation measures for three climate scenarios, considering climate change. The integrated approach highlighted the importance of the initial selection of materials, considering their associated impacts as well as the thermal and energy performance of the building during its life time, and the importance of climate change for the operational phase of the building. With the Sustainability Index in the Energy Life Cycle, large reductions were obtained comparing cases with adaptation measures to current practice. Results of this research contribute to improve project's decisions with the incorporation of a holistic approach for the projects that are being produced for the housing deficit, considering better energy performance and lower resource consumption for users and the country in the long term.(c) 2021 Published by Elsevier B.V.",1
"The Pampas is among the major agricultural regions in the world; a large proportion of Argentina crop production is originated in this region. The exportation of grain and oil crop represents more than 40% of the total national exportations.Impact of future climate on wheat, maize and soybean yield and crop adaptation in the Pampas region (60 million hectares) are assessed using climatic inputs generated by CCSM4 climate model (National Center for Atmospheric Research, US). Projections show an increase in the seasonal means maximum and minimum temperature for both the near (2015-2039) and the far (2075-2099) future, as well as a seasonal annual precipitation increase in the near future and a significant increase in the far future with extreme emissions scenarios.In the near future the crop model projects a reduction in wheat yield, an increase in maize yield and a significant increment in soybean yield compared to the regional baseline for moderate (RCP4.5) and extreme (RCP8.5) emissions. In the far future the projection shows a decrease in wheat yield in the RCP4.5 scenario and an increase in the RCP8.5 scenario, maize and soybean shown a yield increase in both scenarios. Adaptation strategies for the near and far future are proposed for wheat and maize that result in up to 45% yield increases. Adaptation strategies are not proposed for soybean because yield increases were predicted in all scenarios and horizons.",1
"The pace of current climate change is expected to be problematic for alpine flora and fauna, as their adaptive capacity may be limited by small population size. Yet, despite substantial genetic drift following post-glacial recolonization of alpine habitats, alpine species are notable for their success surviving in highly heterogeneous environments. Population genomic analyses demonstrating how alpine species have adapted to novel environments with limited genetic diversity remain rare, yet are important in understanding the potential for species to respond to contemporary climate change. In this study, we explored the evolutionary history of alpine ground beetles in the Nebria ingens complex, including the demographic and adaptive changes that followed the last glacier retreat. We first tested alternative models of evolutionary divergence in the species complex. Using millions of genome-wide SNP markers from hundreds of beetles, we found evidence that the N. ingens complex has been formed by past admixture of lineages responding to glacial cycles. Recolonization of alpine sites involved a distributional range shift to higher elevation, which was accompanied by a reduction in suitable habitat and the emergence of complex spatial genetic structure. We tested several possible genetic pathways involved in adaptation to heterogeneous local environments using genome scan and genotype-environment association approaches. From the identified genes, we found enriched functions associated with abiotic stress responses, with strong evidence for adaptation to hypoxia-related pathways. The results demonstrate that despite rapid demographic change, alpine beetles in the N. ingens complex underwent rapid physiological evolution.",1

"Purpose - This paper aims to propose a collaborative approach toward an integrated vulnerability assessment to climate change in Germany that attempts to bridge the gap between scientific output and policy demand.Design/methodology/approach - Conceptually, the approach follows the definition of vulnerability as used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, but it has modified this basic concept. It clearly distinguishes between three time slices (presence, near and remote future) not only regarding the change in the climatic conditions but also socio-economic development trends.Findings - The paper concentrates on the selected methodological framework, the collaborative research design and those preliminary results of the nationwide vulnerability assessment that are transferable to other settings.Practical implications - A Vulnerability Network (Netzwerk Vulnerabilitaet) emerged from an applied research project commissioned under the Adaptation Action Plan of the German Strategy for Adaptation to Climate Change by the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety and the Federal Environment Agency. The assessment serves as evidence basis for the implementation of the German Adaptation Strategy. Thus, all relevant federal authorities and agencies are represented in the Vulnerability Network.Originality/value - The approach is the first really integrative vulnerability assessment for the whole Germany, as it considers not only 16 sectors but also interconnections between these sectors and cumulative effects for three different time slices. Moreover, the normative component of the assessment was clearly separated from the analytic one. The Vulnerability Network as a whole has been responsible for all normative decisions to be taken during the assessment procedure thus ensuring a wide understanding and acceptance of commonly achieved results.",1

"Railway infrastructure is vulnerable to extreme weather events such as elevated temperature, flooding, storms, intense winds, sea level rise, poor visibility, etc. These events have extreme consequences for the dependability of railway infrastructure and the acceptable level of services by infrastructure managers and other stakeholders. It is quite complex and difficult to quantify the consequences of climate change on railway infrastructure because of the inherent nature of the railway itself. Hence, the main aim of this work is to qualitatively identify and assess the impact of climate change on railway infrastructure with associated risks and consequences. A qualitative research methodology is employed in the study using a questionnaire as a tool for information gathering from experts from several municipalities in Sweden, Swedish transport infrastructure managers, maintenance organizations, and train operators. The outcome of this questionnaire revealed that there was a lower level of awareness about the impact of climate change on the various facets of railway infrastructure. Furthermore, the work identifies the challenges and barriers for climate adaptation of railway infrastructure and suggests recommended actions to improve the resilience towards climate change.

"The ecological impact of continental scale land-use policies that influence forest management is often difficult to quantify. European forest conservation began in 1909 with a marked increase in designated areas with the inception of Natura 2000 in the early 1990s. It has been shown that increases in European forest mortality may be linked to climate variability. Measuring productivity response to climate variability may be a valid proxy indicating a forest's ability to bear this disturbance. Net Primary Production (NPP) response to climate variability has also been linked to functional diversity within forests. Using a European specific annual MODIS NPP estimates, we assess the NPP response to climate variability differences between actively managed forests, which experience human interventions and conserved, Protected Area (PA) forests with minimal to no human impact. We found, on the continental scale, little to no differences in NPP response between managed and conserved forests. However, on the regional scale, differences emerge that are driven by the historic forest management practices and the potential speciation of the area. Northern PA forests show the same NPP response to climate variability as their actively managed counter parts. PA forests tend to have less NPP response to climate variability in the South and in older conserved forests. As the time a forest has been designated, as a PA, extends past its typically actively managed rotation length, greater differences begin to emerge between the two management types.",1
"Different ways of thinking and understanding urban problems and imagining solutions are needed to redress the suite of serious challenges facing cities. Focusing on urban nature, this conceptual paper begins from the standpoint that nature-based solutions (NBS) could help remake cities as places for more than just people; in other words, cities could encourage the flourishing of multiple species and ecosystems, including but not limited to, humans. Although cities were once considered 'biodiversity wastelands', they are now recognised as providing important habitat. However, NBS have been plagued by criticisms of anthropocentrism whereby human needs are prioritised over those of other species and ecosystems. To overcome this problem, the paper provides an outline of more-than-human thinking and suggests how relational concepts can help NBS move beyond an inherent anthropocentrism, and also begins to work through some of the complexities of making this shift. More-than-human thinking and theories have arisen in several disciplines, but despite a considerable presence in the literature, they have not yet been brought into conversation with NBS. The paper concludes that more-than-human thinking can generate deeper understanding of the interdependencies between all the entities that comprise cities, such that more inclusive NBS could be implemented.",1

"Bacterial communities display an astonishing degree of heterogeneities among their constituent cells across both the genomic and transcriptomic levels, giving rise to diverse social interactions and stress-adaptation strategies indispensable for proliferating in the natural environment (Ackermann in Nat Rev Microbiol 13:497-508, 2015). Our knowledge about bacterial heterogeneities and their physiological ramifications critically depends on our ability to unambiguously resolve the genetic and phenotypic states of the individual cells that make up the population. In this short review, I highlight several recently developed methods for studying bacterial heterogeneities, primarily focusing on single-cell techniques based on advanced sequencing and microscopy technologies. I will discuss the working principle of each technique as well as the types of problems each technique is best positioned to address. With significant improvements in resolution and throughput, these emerging tools together offer unprecedented and complementary views of various types of heterogeneities found within bacterial populations, paving the way for mechanistic dissections and systematic interventions in laboratory and clinical settings.",0
"The foremost role of forest vegetation in storing biomass and carbon (C) stock constitutes one of the main nature-based solutions to mitigate climate change. In this study, we aimed to quantify biomass and C stock partitioning in multiple vegetation strata (tree, shrub, herb, and ground floor layers) of major forest types in Jammu and Kashmir, Western Himalaya, India. We used a stratified random cluster sampling strategy to collect field data in 96 forest stands of 12 forest types (altitudinal range: 350 to 3450 m) in the study region. We evaluated the degree to which the carbon stock of the entire ecosystem was dependent on the multiple vegetation strata using the Pearson method. Across all the forest types, the average total ecosystem-level biomass was estimated to be 181.95 Mgha(-1) (range: 60.64-528.98). Forest strata-wise, the maximum biomass of 172.92 Mgha(-1) (range: 50.64-514.97) was found in the tree vegetation, followed by 5.58 Mgha(-1) (range: 2.59-8.93) in understory vegetation (shrubs and herbaceous), and 3.44 Mgha(-1) (range: 0.97 and 9.14) in the forest floor. The total ecosystem-level biomass showed a peak at mid-elevation coniferous forest types, whereas the lowest was observed in low-elevation broad leaved forest types. At the ecosystem-level, on average, the understory contributed 3% and the forest floor 2% to the total C stock across the forest types. The shrub layer contributed up to 80% of total understory C, with the herbaceous layer accounting for the remaining 20%. The ordination analysis clearly shows that anthropogenic and environmental variables significantly (p <= 0.002) influence the forest types' C stock in the region. Our findings have significant implications for conserving natural forest ecosystems and restoring degraded forest landscapes in this Himalayan region, which in turn can lead to better carbon sequestration and climate mitigation outcomes.",1
"The climate change adaptation field has evolved considerably in recent years. Important contributions have been made, with scholars developing methods for assessing vulnerability in different countries and communities, documenting broad strategies for adaptation and identifying opportunities for and barriers to adaptation as well as ways to enhance adaptive capacity. Issues of sustainability are, however, not readily argued and embraced. Predominantly, our analysis exposes that current adaptation discourse, particularly in Africa, offers a narrow conceptualisation of sustainability. The paper argues for a clear framework of sustainability in adaptation discourse which encompasses awareness to contextual aspects in responding to climate variability and change as well as resilience aspects. The paper also calls for an expansion of the knowledge base around the concept of climate-smart agriculture' towards effectively incorporating sustainability aspects in climate change adaptation discourse.",1
"The sustainable livelihoods framework (SLF) highlights the positive relationship between a broad portfolio of household livelihood capitals and adaptive capacity to climate change. However, the SLF overlooks the interactions and transformations that occur between different types of capital. To test our hypothesis that complementarity-substitution exists between the five livelihood capitals, and that only increasing complementary capital can improve adaptive capacity, we assessed the adaptive capacity of apple farmers to drought events in the Loess Plateau, China. This was done through a substitutive-complementary analysis of the relationships between social, human, physical, natural, and financial capital. Using Pearson's correlation analysis, we tested the impact of 13 livelihood capital indicators on farmers' adaptive capacity. We found that some forms of capital have a substitutive effect, some have a complementary effect, and others have both. It is the overall product of these complementary indicators that increases adaptive capacity. We conclude that a substitutive-complementary approach can enhance our understanding of the role of livelihood capital in reducing farmers' vulnerability and strengthen approaches to increasing adaptive capacity.",1
"The evolutionary reasons for variation in nose shape across human populations have been subject to continuing debate. An import function of the nose and nasal cavity is to condition inspired air before it reaches the lower respiratory tract. For this reason, it is thought the observed differences in nose shape among populations are not simply the result of genetic drift, but may be adaptations to climate. To address the question of whether local adaptation to climate is responsible for nose shape divergence across populations, we use Qst-Fst comparisons to show that nares width and alar base width are more differentiated across populations than expected under genetic drift alone. To test whether this differentiation is due to climate adaptation, we compared the spatial distribution of these variables with the global distribution of temperature, absolute humidity, and relative humidity. We find that width of the nares is correlated with temperature and absolute humidity, but not with relative humidity. We conclude that some aspects of nose shape may indeed have been driven by local adaptation to climate. However, we think that this is a simplified explanation of a very complex evolutionary history, which possibly also involved other non- neutral forces such as sexual selection.",0
"Vulnerability to climate change of the Moldavian part of the Dniester river was assessed as the function of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity of its basin's natural and socioeconomic systems. As a spatial scale of the assessment, Moldova's administrative-territorial units (ATUs) were selected. The exposure assessment was based on the climatic analysis of baseline (1971-2000) temperature and precipitation and projections of their changes in 2021-2050, separately for cold and warm periods. The sensitivity assessment included physiographical and socioeconomic characteristics, described by a set of specific indicators. The adaptive capacity was expressed by general economic and agricultural indicators, taking into consideration the medical provision and housing conditions. Through a ranking approach, the relative vulnerability of each ATU was calculated by summing its sensitivity and adaptive capacity ranks; the latter were obtained as combinations of their primary indicator ranks, arranged in an increasing and decreasing order, respectively. Due to lack of sound knowledge on these components' importance in overall assessment of vulnerability, their weights were taken as conventionally equal. Mapping of vulnerability revealed that ATUs neighboring to municipalities are the most vulnerable and need special attention in climate change adaptation. The basin's hotspots were discussed with public participation.",1

"Directly or indirectly, positively or negatively, climate change will affect all sectors and regions of the United States. The impacts, however, will not be homogenous across regions, sectors, population groups or time. The literature specifically related to how climate change will affect rural communities, their resilience, and adaptive capacity in the United States (U. S.) is scarce. This article bridges this knowledge gap through an extensive review of the current state of knowledge to make inferences about the rural communities vulnerability to climate change based on Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scenarios. Our analysis shows that rural communities tend to be more vulnerable than their urban counterparts due to factors such as demography, occupations, earnings, literacy, poverty incidence, and dependency on government funds. Climate change impacts on rural communities differs across regions and economic sectors; some will likely benefit while others lose. Rural communities engaged in agricultural and forest related activities in the Northeast might benefit, while those in the Southwest and Southeast could face additional water stress and increased energy cost respectively. Developing adaptation and mitigation policy options geared towards reducing climatic vulnerability of rural communities is warranted. A set of regional and local studies is needed to delineate climate change impacts across rural and urban communities, and to develop appropriate policies to mitigate these impacts. Integrating research across disciplines, strengthening research-policy linkages, integrating ecosystem services while undertaking resource valuation, and expanding alternative energy sources, might also enhance coping capacity of rural communities in face of future climate change.",1

"The increasing uncertainty related to disaster risk under climate change brings about new challenges for sustainable urban management. The emergence of the urban resilience concept can improve the ability and extent to which cities can absorb and resolve risks, providing insight into the sustainable development of cities and regions. Yet, to date, the impact of climate change on regional urban resilience is not well understood. 'this paper measures the changes in urban resilience of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region from 1998 to 2019, and then explores the contribution of climate influencing factors such as temperature, precipitation and wind speed to urban resilience using econometric models. Results demonstrate the following: (1) Urban resilience shows a large spatial heterogeneity in the BTH region. Overall, Beijing and Tianjin have better and more stable resilience than Hebei Province. (2) Regarding the static impact of climate change on urban resilience, a 1 unit increase in Ln temperature and Ln precipitation will respectively increase Ln resilience by 1.01 units and 0.54 units, indicating that it has a significant positive impact on urban resilience. Each 1 unit increase in Ln wind speed will decrease resilience by 1.65 units, representing a significant negative effect. (3) Regarding the dynamic impact of climate change on urban resilience, a positive 1 unit impact of climatic factors indicates that an increase in temperature will first increase and then decrease urban resilience, and an increase in precipitation and wind speed will initially support improvement in urban resilience. Based on these findings, this article offers policy recommendations to improve urban resilience.",1
"This study advances theory articulating the micro-level processes behind public organization adaptation to extreme weather. It tackles a persistent puzzle about the limited adaptation to extreme weather among public organizations: why does adaptation remain deficit after public organizations have experienced repeated extreme weather and some catastrophic consequences? We develop a computational agent-based model that integrates extant theory and data from semi-structured interviews of U.S. public transit agency managers, and use the model to investigate how micro-level cognition and behavior interact with environmental constraints to facilitate or impede the diffusion of adaptation. We articulate in greater detail how experience with influential extreme weather events matters to adaptation, highlighting that such experience is insufficient for adaptation to occur. A key insight is that the potential benefits from both increased risk perception and additional financial resources stemming from disaster- or non-disaster-induced opportunities can be underutilized, absent effective coupling between heightened risk perception and availability of resources that creates windows for adaptation. Using this insight, we further identify managerial and policy interventions with maximum leverage to promote adaptation to extreme weather in public organizations. The experiments show that slowing risk perception decay and synchronizing opportunities with extreme weather occurrences can stimulate adaptation.",1
"The paper argues that policies towards upland communities in Vietnam tend to reinforce land use strategies that increase vulnerability to climate-related risk and undermine adaptive capacity of upland communities. It is argued that the division of land use between intensive agriculture/tree plantation and protected forest is increasing both livelihood- and environmental risk. Qualitative interviews and group discussion with upland villagers and local government staff in two districts of north and central Vietnam suggest that farmers are facing frequent loss and damage due to floods, storms and drought. Changing production patterns, together with the increase in climate-related hazards and stresses, is changing the character of vulnerability of upland communities. The study primarily explores village-level perspectives regarding impacts of hazards and stresses, ideas of how to reduce risk, along with how related policies and institutions influence local possibilities of risk reduction and adaptation. Our fieldwork results suggest that many villagers and local leaders see adaptation and risk reduction in terms of improved irrigation and in terms of access to land and forests for their livelihoods. The findings support arguments for more integration of agriculture and forestry land use, allowing for more flexibility in the development of upland livelihoods, with the aim of facilitating adaptation to climate change.",1
"Starting from the existing wind energy potential in Romania, from the possibilities of recovery and its use by developing wind power parks / farms in appropriate areas, the paper presents some research conducted both globally, but, also, at the national level, for developing and testing of hydrostatic transmissions, in order to be use in the wind power plants, instead of the existing mechanical transmission (gear-box). The results showed a flexible dynamic behavior, energy efficiency and possibilities of increasing the energy efficiency in mechanical energy conversion chain of wind power into electric power, through hydrostatic transmission, which offers the advantages of high power density and an increased dynamic adaptive capacity at strong variation of the wind turbine speed, at the required quasi-constant speed at the electrical generator.",0
"Projections of future streamflow extremes are subjected to various sources of uncertainties. Uncertainties arising from different stages in the modelling process of extremes contribute to the overall uncertainty in the final estimates. In this study, some important sources of uncertainties that occur in the modelling chain for projection of future extremes are analysed. The contribution of climate models, hydrological models, representative concentration pathways (RCPs) and the parameters of the extreme value distribution to the overall uncertainty in the streamflow return levels of the Chaliyar river basin in Kerala, India, was quantified using analysis of variance. 5, 10, 25, and 50-year return levels for the near (2021-2050) and far (2070-2099) future periods were computed. Results of the study indicate that the median values of return levels for the near (0.6-13.5%) and far (21.5-37.3%) future periods are higher than the corresponding values for the observed data. Also the uncertainty ranges of the return levels in the near (2-2.4 times) and far (3-3.7 times) future for different return periods are higher compared to that of the observed. The contribution to uncertainties in the return levels from climate models, parameters of the extreme value distribution employed and hydrological models is higher than that from the RCPs. The contribution of parameter uncertainty increases with the return period and that of the climate models reduces with the return period for the two future periods considered in this study, indicating that parameter uncertainty is an important source of uncertainty and has to be considered while predicting the future extremes. The contribution to uncertainty by the hydrological models and by the RCPs does not exhibit much variation for different return periods in both the future time periods considered. Understanding the uncertainties in future extremes would help to devise proper adaptation strategies to mitigate the probable impacts of climate change.",1
"Weather variability over the long run exhibits the trends of change in climate and forewarns for development and deployment of adaptation measures. Gangetic plain of Uttar Pradesh in India is an agriculturally important geographical region of South East Asia. The region is vulnerable to weather variability led glacier melting, climate change impacts and increased competition for land. In addition, changes in rainfall, groundwater and weather patterns are deteriorating the agricultural and water systems that are bound to affect the food production and throw the poor populace into chaotic conditions. As weather variability trends are being increasingly used for sustaining the food production in climate-sensitive regions, the present study was taken up in Lucknow district of Uttar Pradesh. Daily meteorological datasets of temperature, rainfall, rainy days, evaporation, wind speed, relative humidity and bright sunshine hours during the past 63 years (1956-2018) were analysed for long-term trends. The study indicated conspicuous long-term trends of reduction in annual rainfall (- 28.97 mm decade(-1)), rising level of daily Tmin (0.09 degrees C a decade) and RH (1.08% decade(-1)) coupled with significant declining trends in evaporation (- 0.31 mm day(-1)), wind speed (- 0.29 km h(-1)) and bright sunshine hours (- 0.19 h day(-1)), that poignantly elucidates a clear warming trend over the period in the region. Multi-pronged adaptation strategies comprising of development of water efficient crop varieties, cropping system diversification with less water requiring crops, adoption of water efficient irrigation techniques, surface water harvesting and copious ground water recharge have been proposed for coping up.",1
"Water for the Seasons was a five-year collaborative research project which aimed to assess the climate resiliency of the Truckee-Carson River System, a snow-fed river system in the western United States. The collaborative research design featured iterative interactions involving an interdisciplinary research team and local stakeholders that produced climate science information identified by stakeholders as necessary to support adaptation to climate-induced water supply variability. This information included plausible climate scenarios to test the resiliency of the river system and models simulating hydrologic results to examine changes in water availability. In this paper, we present formative and summative evaluation data collected over the course of the project to determine the extent to which this collaborative research project met stakeholders' climate science information needs. Results indicate that over a five-year period, the project: 1) co-produced new climate science information to support local climate adaptation; 2) consistently engaged stakeholders in research that facilitated social learning to identify innovative strategies to adapt water management; 3) provided iterative interactions between stakeholders and researchers to ensure resulting information services were useful to stakeholders; 4) combined diverse, practical stakeholder knowledge with rigorous scientific research to co-produce legitimate climate science information; and 5) effectively utilized Extension as a boundary organization to design, implement, and evaluate collaborative research processes and outcomes. Further empirical work is necessary to continue testing and standardizing metrics that illuminate collaborative research successes and failures, and to identify best practices that guide future collaborations to co-produce climate science information.",1
"Climate change is driving new challenges for farmers around the world, provoking a sense of urgency in the search for on -farm solutions and pathways to sustainable agricultural systems. While agroecology has gained recognition as a promising option for climate resilience, it remains nascent in the Canadian Prairies- a significant agricultural region dominated by large-scale conventional agriculture. Amid the sprawling fields of grains and oilseeds primarily destined for export markets, growing farm consolidation, and increased land concentration, farmers committed to ecological principles are building a prefigurative foundation for prairie agroecology. Far from cohering into a unified definition, this article captures what agroecology on the Prairies looks like. Through a community -engaged research design and in consultation with the National Farmers Union of Canada, we explore farmers' reflections on agroecology and provide a participatory platform for farmer -led constructions of agroecology. Through dialogue with 19 farmers of different farm sizes and production types that began in the 2021 farming season-one marked by drought and extreme heat-we use photovoice, visual elicitation interviews, and participatory video to document and mobilize visual constructions of an emerging prairie agroecology. Despite a shared vision among the farmer participants about the need for a sustainability transition through diversified farming practices, three key questions emerged about the future of prairie agroecology: (1) Can prairie agroecology scale up and out, and if so, under what conditions? (2) To what extent is prairie agroecology possible without dense, place -based social networks? and (3) What are the possibilities for prairie agroecology when the future of farming in the region is uncertain, especially given the changing farmer demographics and Canada's settler colonial context? We explore these questions and provide reflections on key issues confronting the future of prairie agroecology.",1
"Global sustainability targets demand transformative changes. Nature-based solutions (NbS) are gaining traction in science and policy, but their potential for transformative change remains unexplored. We provide a framework to evaluate how NbS contribute to transformative change and apply it to 93 NbS from mountain social-ecological systems (SES). The framework serves to assess what elements may catalyze transformative change, how transformative change occurs, and what its outcomes are. Our results show that NbS are as much people based'' as nature based.'' Most NbS are based on four elements with transformation poten-tial: nature's values, knowledge types, community engagement, and nature management practices. Our results confirm the potential of NbS for transformative change, observed through changes in non-sustainable trajectories of SES. We illustrate the components of our framework through a novel classification of NbS. The framework provides key components for assessing the effectiveness of NbS and allows tracking long-term transformative change processes.",1
"Background: Cognitive-walking interference is manifested when simultaneously performing a cognitive task while walking. However, majority of the dual-task walking paradigms incorporated relatively short testing trials and were focused on posing a cognitive challenge by adding a secondary cognitive task but not introducing walking perturbations.Research question: How do healthy young adults adapt to concurrent cognitive challenges and walking perturbations in terms of task prioritization and adaptation strategies to control walking stability?Methods: Eighteen healthy young participants walked with and without (1) continuous treadmill platform sways (Perturbed and Unperturbed walking), and (2) performing one of the cognitive tasks: visual and auditory Stroop tasks, Clock task, Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT), and walk only. Primary outcome measures included cognitive task performance, mediolateral dynamic margins of stability (MOSML), M-L local dynamic stability, stride time variability and the dual-task interference (DTI) on these measures.Results: Gait adjustments made during Perturbed walking did not improve walking stability but instead, showing more local instability and greater gait variability (all p < 0.001) than Unperturbed walking. Participants increased average MOSML during Clock and PASAT compared to Walk Only for both Perturbed and Unperturbed walking (THSD, p < 0.05). Participants had significantly less DTI on stride time variability during Unperturbed walking than during Perturbed walking (p < 0.001). Participants also had significantly greater DTI on PASAT performance during Perturbed than during Unperturbed walking (THSD, p < 0.05)Significance: Participants prioritized the walking task under a more challenging walking condition although the adjustments made during Perturbed walking were not sufficient to maintain a similar level of walking stability as Unperturbed walking. Adjustments to the cognitive-walking challenges were differed by the type of cognitive tasks. The current findings suggest that cognitive tasks involving both working memory and information processing or visuospatial recognition or attention have greater impact on gait especially during the perturbed walking condition.",0
"Ambient temperatures are major factors regulating the growth rates, yields, and geographical distribution of crop species. The cultivation of sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) is expanding with the rising demand in regions where it is not traditionally grown, and sub-optimal yields due to extremely low or high temperatures could occur. Currently literature lacks information on the temperature responses of sesame growth. An experiment was conducted to quantify the effects of different temperatures on vegetative growth and reproductive development of sesame, and to estimate its cardinal temperature limits (T-opt; T-min; T-max). Plants were subjected to six different day/night temperature treatments of 40/32, 36/28, 32/24, 28/20, and 20/12 degrees C using walk-in growth chambers. Vegetative growth of sesame was sensitive to low temperatures (< 15 degrees C), but tolerant of high temperatures. The cardinal temperature limits of 15.7 degrees C (T-min), 27.3 degrees C (T-opt), and 44.6 degrees C (T-max) were observed for rate of biomass accumulation. Sesame reached the flowering stage under moderate to high temperature conditions; however, reproductive yields progressively declined above 25 degrees C, and no seed yields were obtained beyond 33 degrees C. The estimated temperature limits could be employed to develop crop models for simulating management and adaptation strategies of sesame under current and future climate scenarios, and adaptation to regions where the crop is not currently grown. Future research should focus on understanding factors controlling the temperature tolerance of reproductive development in sesame, to provide a broader geographical adaptation.",1

"Objective: This study examined whether a wellbeing approach to resilience and adaptation would provide practical insights for prioritizing support to communities experiencing environmental and socio-economic stressors. Methods: A cross-sectional survey, based on a purposive sample of 2,196 stakeholders (landholders, hobby farmers, town resident and change agents) from three irrigation-dependent communities in Australia's Murray-Darling Basin. Respondents' adaptive capacity and wellbeing (individual and collective adaptive capacity, subjective wellbeing, social support, community connectivity, community leadership, in the context of known life stressors) were examined using chi-square, comparison of mean scores, hierarchical regression and factor-cluster analysis. Results: Statistically significant correlations (p < 0.05) were observed between individual (0.331) and collective (0.318) adaptive capacity and wellbeing. Taking into account respondents' self-assessed health and socio-economic circumstances, perceptions of individual (15%) and collective adaptive capacity (10%) as well as community connectivity (13%) were associated with wellbeing (R-2 = 0.36; F (9, 2099) = 132.9; p < 0.001). Cluster analysis found that 11% of respondents were particularly vulnerable, reporting below average scores on all indicators, with 56% of these reporting below threshold scores on subjective wellbeing. Conclusions: Addressing the capacity of individuals to work with others and to adapt to change, serve as important strategies in maintaining wellbeing in communities under stress. The human impacts of exogenous stressors appear to manifest themselves in poorer health outcomes; addressing primary stressors may in turn aid wellbeing. Longitudinal studies are indicated to verify these findings. Wellbeing may serve as a useful and parsimonious proxy measure for resilience and adaptive capacity.",1
"Spontaneous nystagmus (SN) is a symptom of acute vestibular tone asymmetry. Alexander's Law (AL) states that slow-phase velocity of SN is higher when looking in the direction of fast-phases of nystagmus and lower in the slow-phase direction. Earlier explanations for AL predict that during SN, slow-phase eye velocity is a linear function of eye position, increasing linearly as eye deviates towards the fast-phase direction. Recent observations, however, show that this is often not the case; eye velocity does not vary linearly with eye position. Such new findings necessitate a re-evaluation of our understanding of AL. As AL may be an adaptive response of the vestibular system to peripheral lesions, understanding its mechanism could shed light on early adaptation strategies of the brain. Here, we propose a physiologically plausible mechanism for AL that explains recent experimental data. We use a dynamic control system model to simulate this mechanism and make testable predictions. This mechanism is based on the known effects of unilateral vestibular deficit on the response of the ipsi- and contralesional vestibular nuclei (VN) of the brainstem. This hypothesis is based on the silencing of the majority of ipsilesional VN units, which creates an asymmetry between the responses of the ipsi- and contralesional VN. Unlike former explanations, the new hypothesis does not rely on lesion detection strategies or signals originating in higher brain structures. The proposed model demonstrates possible consequences of acute peripheral deficits for the function of the velocity-to-position neural integrator of the ocular motor system and the vestibulo-ocular reflex.",0
"Grain amaranth is an underutilized crop with high nutritional quality from the Americas. Emerging genomic and biotechnological tools are becoming available that allow the integration of novel breeding techniques for rapid improvement of amaranth and other underutilized crops.Out of thousands of edible plants, only three cereals-maize, wheat and rice-are the major food sources for a majority of people worldwide. While these crops provide high amounts of calories, they are low in protein and other essential nutrients. The dependence on only few crops, with often narrow genetic basis, leads to a high vulnerability of modern cropping systems to the predicted climate change and accompanying weather extremes. Broadening our food sources through the integration of so-called orphan crops can help to mitigate the effects of environmental change and improve qualitative food security. Thousands of traditional crops are known, but have received little attention in the last century and breeding efforts were limited. Amaranth is such an underutilized pseudocereal that is of particular interest because of its balanced amino acid and micronutrient profiles. Additionally, the C-4 photosynthetic pathway and ability to withstand environmental stress make the crop a suitable choice for future agricultural systems. Despite the potential of amaranth, efforts of genetic improvement lag considerably behind those of major crops. The progress in novel breeding methods and molecular techniques developed in model plants and major crops allow a rapid improvement of underutilized crops. Here, we review the history of amaranth and recent advances in genomic tools and give a concrete perspective how novel breeding techniques can be implemented into breeding programs. Our perspectives are transferable to many underutilized crops. The implementation of these could improve the nutritional quality and climate resilience of future cropping systems.",1

"Purpose - This paper aims to discuss the roles of social protection in reducing and facilitating climate-induced migration. Social protection gained attention in the international climate negotiations with the establishment of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage. Yet, its potential to address migration, considered as a key issue in the loss and damage debate, has not been sufficiently explored. This paper aims at identifying key characteristics of social protection schemes which could effectively address climate-induced migration and attempts to derive recommendations for policy design.Design/methodology/approach - Based on the existing literature, the paper links empirical evidence on the effects of social protection to climate-related drivers of migration and the needs of vulnerable populations. This approach allows conceptually identifying characteristics of effective social protection policies.Findings - Findings indicate that social protection can be part of a proactive approach to managing climate-induced migration both in rural and urban areas. In particular, public work programmes offer solutions to different migration outcomes, from no to permanent migration. Benefits are achieved when programmes explicitly integrate climate change impacts into their design. Social protection can provide temporary support to facilitate migration, in situ adaptation or integration and adaptation in destination areas. It is no substitution for but can help trigger sustainable adaptation solutions.Originality/value - The paper helps close research gaps regarding the potential roles and channels of social protection for addressing and facilitating climate-induced migration and providing public support in destination, mostly in urban areas.",1

"Air temperatures are increasing because of global climate change. A warming phenomenon strongly related to global climate change is the urban heat island. It has been shown that the hotter temperatures occurring in cities during the summer negatively affect human wellbeing, but little is known about the potential mechanisms underlying the relationships between hotter temperatures, cognitive psychological resources and wellbeing. The aim of the present research is to understand whether, and how, spending time in urban green spaces, which can be considered as a specific kind of Nature-Based Solution (NBS), helps the recovery of cognitive resources and wellbeing. The main hypothesis is that contact with urban green is related to wellbeing through the depletion of cognitive resources (i.e., ego depletion). Moreover, we expected that individuals showing higher scores of ego depletion also report a higher estimate of the maximum temperature reached during the summer. The results of a survey (N = 115) conducted among visitors to Parco Nord Milano, a large urban park located in Milan (Italy), point out that people visiting the park during the summer show a higher level of wellbeing as well as a lower level of ego depletion. A mediation analysis shows that visiting urban green spaces is associated with greater wellbeing through less ego depletion. Our results also point out that, as expected, people showing a higher level of ego depletion tend to overestimate the maximum air temperature. Implications for future studies and applied interventions regarding the role of NBS to promote human wellbeing are discussed.",1
"Background: Little is known about the potential of Brachypodium distachyon as a model for low temperature stress responses in Pooideae. The ice recrystallization inhibition protein (IRIP) genes, fructosyltransferase (FST) genes, and many C-repeat binding factor (CBF) genes are Pooideae specific and important in low temperature responses. Here we used comparative analyses to study conservation and evolution of these gene families in B. distachyon to better understand its potential as a model species for agriculturally important temperate grasses.Results: Brachypodium distachyon contains cold responsive IRIP genes which have evolved through Brachypodium specific gene family expansions. A large cold responsive CBF3 subfamily was identified in B. distachyon, while CBF4 homologs are absent from the genome. No B. distachyon FST gene homologs encode typical core Pooideae FST-motifs and low temperature induced fructan accumulation was dramatically different in B. distachyon compared to core Pooideae species.Conclusions: We conclude that B. distachyon can serve as an interesting model for specific molecular mechanisms involved in low temperature responses in core Pooideae species. However, the evolutionary history of key genes involved in low temperature responses has been different in Brachypodium and core Pooideae species. These differences limit the use of B. distachyon as a model for holistic studies relevant for agricultural core Pooideae species.",1
"Organismal traits may experience conflicting selection pressures if they fulfil different functions simultaneously. This can require trade-offs between functions or alternatively functional separation between elements of the trait. An important multifunctional trait in insects is the cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) layer. CHCs cover the body of nearly all insects, protect against desiccation and serve as a communication signal. In social insects like ants, they provide cues for nestmate recognition. To maintain their waterproofing function, insects have to adjust CHC composition to current temperatures. These changes might affect information content and interfere with communication, which would be especially detrimental in social insects. Here, we studied how acclimation affects nestmate recognition in two sister species of the ant genus Lasius. Colony fragments were exposed to three climate regimes. We analysed behaviour towards same and differently acclimated conspecifics, and determined which CHCs were related to acclimatory changes, colony differences and inter-individual aggression. Differential acclimation led to higher aggression and chemical distances among former nestmates. We identified small CHC subsets, which only differed among colonies or among acclimation treatments. Moreover, few compounds sufficed to explain inter-individual aggression, suggesting that ants do not use the entire CHC profile for nestmate recognition and that colony identity is encoded in a redundant way. Across individual CHCs, their contribution to colony differences and to differences among acclimatory treatments was negatively correlated, indicating that there is some degree of functional separation. However, CHC classes could not be clearly assigned to one or another function, indicating that the role of each CHC is idiosyncratic and may differ among species. Acclimatory effects and colony differences were more independent from each other in L. platythorax than in L. niger, indicating that functional separation can differ even among sister species. Our results show that CHC functions are more intertwined than previously assumed, suggesting that insects cannot optimise all functions independently. The main constraint might be the need to maintain a certain phase behaviour of the CHC layer, which depends on CHC composition and affects functionality. The need to separate functions might depend on species-specific ecological and life-history parameters. Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.",0

"The aim of our study was to use the coupled climate-carbon cycle model HadCM3C to quantify climate impact of ecosystem changes over recent decades and under future scenarios, due to changes in both atmospheric CO2 and surface albedo. We use two future scenarios - the IPCC SRES A1B scenario, and a climate stabilisation scenario (2C20), allowing us to assess the impact of climate mitigation on results. We performed a pair of simulations under each scenario - one in which vegetation was fixed at the initial state and one in which vegetation changes dynamically in response to climate change, as determined by the interactive vegetation model within HadCM3C.In our simulations with interactive vegetation, relatively small changes in global vegetation coverage were found, mainly dominated by increases in shrub and needleleaf trees at high latitudes and losses of broadleaf trees and grasses across the Amazon. Globally this led to a loss of terrestrial carbon, mainly from the soil. Global changes in carbon storage were related to the regional losses from the Amazon and gains at high latitude. Regional differences in carbon storage between the two scenarios were largely driven by the balance between warming-enhanced decomposition and altered vegetation growth. Globally, interactive vegetation reduced albedo acting to enhance albedo changes due to climate change. This was mainly related to the darker land surface over high latitudes (due to vegetation expansion, particularly during December-January and March-May); small increases in albedo occurred over the Amazon. As a result, there was a relatively small impact of vegetation change on most global annual mean climate variables, which was generally greater under A1B than 2C20, with markedly stronger local-to-regional and seasonal impacts. Globally, vegetation change amplified future annual temperature increases by 0.24 and 0.15K (under A1B and 2C20, respectively) and increased global precipitation, with reductions in precipitation over the Amazon and increases over high latitudes. In general, changes were stronger over land - for example, global temperature changes due to interactive vegetation of 0.43 and 0.28K under A1B and 2C20, respectively. Regionally, the warming influence of future vegetation change in our simulations was driven by the balance between driving factors. For instance, reduced tree cover over the Amazon reduced evaporation (particularly during June-August), outweighing the cooling influence of any small albedo changes. In contrast, at high latitudes the warming impact of reduced albedo (particularly during December-February and March-May) due to increased vegetation cover appears to have offset any cooling due to small evaporation increases.Climate mitigation generally reduced the impact of vegetation change on future global and regional climate in our simulations. Our study therefore suggests that there is a need to consider both biogeochemical and biophysical effects in climate adaptation and mitigation decision making.",1
"In world climate science, Bangladesh is considered a poster child of vulnerability. The primary stressors that affect the vulnerability of the Bangladeshi population include sea-level rise, biodiversity degradation, saltwater intrusion, desertification, social exclusion, unstable political conditions, and weak governance systems. Governance is an important non-climatic stressor that has not received sufficient attention. Within this framework, this paper explores the impacts of bribery and extortion on livelihoods and adaptive capacity in the face of climate change and argues that corruption significantly reduces the ability to respond to climatic stressors. Findings draw attention to this critical issue in climate change adaptation and international development in general, particularly for developing countries.",1

From the framework, we quantify the impacts of different parameters/settings of ARQ, AMC, and the FSO link on TCP throughput performance. We also discuss several optimization aspects for TCP performance.",0

"Coastal island communities face significant risks associated with increased natural hazards and other impacts associated with climate change. Further, deeply rooted social issues, lack of awareness or information, and inadequate infrastructure and planning may exacerbate risks to island socio-ecological systems. Understanding these relationships is often difficult, given the lack of methods available for communities to explicitly explore anticipated risks and potential adaptation strategies, in relation to the characteristics of their community socio-ecological system. Social learning has also been shown to foster adaptation to environmental changes, build social trust and empower diverse stakeholders, by offering opportunities for groups of individuals to challenge, negotiate and propose new norms, policies or programs. We present a three-phase social learning framework to facilitate stakeholder-driven scenario-based modeling, in order to inform community disaster planning in relation to the potential impacts of a tsunami. The participatory research was conducted in conjunction with a community disaster committee, representing the communities of the North Shore of O'ahu, Hawai'i. Through a series of iterative participatory modeling workshops using fuzzy-logic cognitive mapping, the community committee represented, explored and actively questioned their beliefs about the natural hazards that their community faces. Further, the modeling process allowed the committee to represent the communities' dynamic nature, run tsunami hazard scenarios to quantify potential direct and indirect effects, and explicitly compare trade-offs of competing adaptation strategies. Changes in the committee's model representations that took place over time demonstrate a progression through single-, double- and triple-loop learning, indicating that social learning occurred across individual to institutional levels, and over short- to longterm time scales.

"This article analyses the implementation and outcomes of national development programs in a mountainous commune in Vietnam. The article traces the history of State intervention and the capacity of households and the community to adapt to change. The assessment reveals unintended consequences of the programs which strongly influence the ability of households to adapt to change. Some households possess more adaptive capacity given their better access to capital while others remain vulnerable because they are constrained in accessing resources and engage in nondiversified livelihoods. If shock events become more frequent, the livelihoods that are nondiversified will be most at risk. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",1
"Reef corals are examples of metazoans that engage in mutualisms with a variety of microorganisms, including dinoflagellates, Bacteria, Archaea, and viruses. The high adaptive capacity of these microbial symbionts can be co-opted by their coral hosts, and various emergent traits of these associations, such as thermotolerance, are undergoing strong selection due to climate change. This selection may spur the rise of microbial 'disaster taxa': opportunistic, cosmopolitan generalists that can proliferate and increase host survivorship following disturbances. Coral bleaching (a stress-induced loss of dinoflagellates) constitutes one type of catastrophic disturbance for resident symbiont communities, and opens novel patches of host for colonization by microbial disaster taxa. Moreover, the compartmentalization of microbial symbionts within coral polyps reduces their effective population size and thus facilitates the spread of disaster taxa during times of environmental change. These phenomena suggest that, despite widespread loss of coral cover as a result of climate disturbances, the potential spread of resilient microbial disaster taxa in surviving colonies can have important implications for coral reef persistence over the coming decades.",1

"To cope with complex environmental impacts in a changing climate, researchers are increasingly being asked to produce science that can directly support policy and decision making. To achieve such societal impact, scientists are using climate services to engage directly with stakeholders to better understand their needs and inform knowledge production. However, the wide variety of climate-services outcomes-ranging from establishing collegial relationships with stakeholders to obtaining specific information for inclusion into a pre-existing decision process-do not directly connect to traditional methods of measuring scientific impact (e.g., publication citations, journal impact factor). In this paper, we describe how concepts from the discipline of evaluation can be used to examine the societal impacts of climate services. We also present a case study from climate impacts and adaptation research to test a scalable evaluation approach. Those who conduct research for the purposes of climate services and those who fund applied climate research would benefit from evaluation from the beginning of project development. Doing so will help ensure that the approach, data collection, and data analysis are appropriately conceived and executed.",1
"Adaptation to exogenous change occurs on both intensive and extensive margins. Whether and how one accounts for human adaptation directly affects estimates of the economic consequences of environmental change, estimates that are both critical in informing policy decisions and notoriously difficult to value. This paper introduces and applies an analytical framework for placing an economic value on adaptation. We explore the issue first in a stylized model that facilitates making concrete generalizations about the kinds of adaptations that generate high or low economic value. We then test the soundness of our insights by incorporating learning and adaptive decision-making into a structural dynamic forestry model where climate change is imposed exogenously and agents respond optimally. Using downscaled climate projections integrated with site- and species-specific timber productivity data, we estimate the economic value of adaptation to climate change within the California timber industry. We find on the intensive margin, changing the rotation intervals will yield a low value of adaptation, but on the extensive margin, replanting more suitable tree species can yield significant value.

"Large-area, long-duration droughts are among Canada's costliest natural disasters. A particularly vulnerable region includes the Canadian Prairies where droughts have, and are projected to continue to have, major impacts. However, individual droughts often differ in their stages such as onset, growth, persistence, retreat, and duration. Using the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index, this study assesses historical and projected future changes to the stages and other characteristics of severe drought occurrence across the agricultural region of the Canadian Prairies. Ten severe droughts occurred during the 1900-2014 period with each having unique temporal and spatial characteristics. Projected changes from 29 global climate models (GCMs) with three representative concentration pathways reveal an increase in severe drought occurrence, particularly toward the end of this century with a high emissions scenario. For the most part, the overall duration and intensity of future severe drought conditions is projected to increase mainly due to longer persistence stages, while growth and retreat stages are generally shorter. Considerable variability exists among individual GCM projections, including their ability to simulate observed severe drought characteristics. This study has increased understanding in potential future changes to a little studied aspect of droughts, namely, their stages and associated characteristics. This knowledge can aid in developing future adaptation strategies.",1
"The combined effects of climate change and urban expansion are elevating urban temperatures, amplifying health risks, and increasing summertime energy demand. Effective heat reduction and adaptation strategies rely on a thorough understanding of urban heat island (UHI) dynamics, which vary within cities and over time due to local urban form and meteorological conditions. While existing studies have examined the spatiotemporal structure of UHIs, they have not examined the space-time variability of air temperature at high spatial and temporal resolutions. This study addresses this gap by utilizing a ground-based sensor network of 53 iButton thermochrons, synoptic weather stations, and satellites to capture these spatiotemporal patterns. Using these data, we developed generalized additive models to predict daily, daytime and nighttime air temperature anomalies throughout Baltimore City. We found that 1) meteorological variables are more influential in characterizing the nighttime UHI than the daytime UHI; 2) spatiotemporal variability of nighttime UHIs is greatest in areas with sparse vegetation canopy cover; and 3) interactions between urban form and meteorology have a systematic but modest impact on the spatial structure of UHIs. The methodology and findings presented in this study offer tools for developing outdoor heat mitigation and adaptation strategies to reduce the UHI effect.",1

"Background and Aims: Ecological restoration has focused on the physical and vegetation components of ecosystems, leaving aside studies on wild fauna and their interactions. Chelonia mydas is an endangered macroherbivore that nests on sandy beaches of Mexico and Cuba, and influences the coastal vegetation with organic matter contributions. The objectives of this study were to analyze its population recovery, a greenness index for dune vegetation, and the amount of organic matter estimated from its clutches before and after the implementation of an official Mexican norm.Methods: Biological data obtained from two and three decades of monitoring 16 Chelonia mydas nesting beaches were analyzed; based on these, three levels of demographic indexes were carried out, the contribution of organic matter by marine turtles to the beach and the vegetal vigor using remote sensing, besides implementing the pertinent statistical analysis.Key results: There was an exponential increase of the green turtle nests (between 12 and 14% per year), associated with population recruitment pulses in 2000 and 2008.

"Geobacillus kaustophilus HTA426 is a thermophilic bacterium whose genome harbors numerous insertion sequences (IS). This study was initially conducted to generate mutant genes for thermostable T7 RNA polymerase in G. kaustophilus; however, relevant experiments unexpectedly identified that the organism transposed multiple IS elements and produced derivative cells that expressed a silent gene via transposition. The transposed elements were diverse and included members of the IS4, IS701, IS1634, and ISLre2 families. The transposition was relatively active at elevated temperatures and generated 4-9 bp of direct repeats at insertion sites. Transposition was more frequent in proliferative cells than in stationary cells but was comparable between both cells when sigX, which encodes an extra-cytoplasmic function sigma factor, was forcibly expressed. Southern blot analysis indicated that IS transposition occurred under growth inhibitory conditions by diverse stressors; however, IS transposition was not detected in cells that were cultured under growth non-inhibitory conditions. These observations suggest that G. kaustophilus enhances IS transposition via sigX-dependent stress responses when proliferative cells were prevented from active propagation. Considering Geobacillus spp. are highly adaptive bacteria that are remarkably distributed in diverse niches, it is possible that these organisms employ IS transposition for environmental adaptation via genetic diversification. Thus, this study provides new insights into adaptation strategies of Geobacillus spp. along with implications for strong codependence between mobile genetic elements and highly adaptive bacteria for stable persistence and evolutionary diversification, respectively. This is also the first report to reveal active IS elements at elevated temperatures in thermophiles and to suggest a sigma factor that governs IS transposition.",0

"Nature-based solutions (NBS) are becoming increasingly important in both the EU and individual countries' political agendas, as a sustainable means to reduce the risk posed by hydrometeorological hazards. However, as the use of NBS is increasing, a number of barriers regarding their practical implementation also become apparent. A number of review studies have summarized and classified barriers, mainly in urban settings. PHUSICOS is a Horizon 2020 Innovation Action to demonstrate the use of NBS in rural and mountain landscapes. Large-scale demonstrator case sites with several sub-projects are established in Italy, Norway and in the French and Spanish Pyrenees. The present paper describes the project's NBS measures and their experienced barriers, some of which have resulted in full cancellation of the planned interventions. Many of the barriers experienced in rural settings have the same root causes as the ones described from urban areas, and the main barrier-creating mechanisms are institutional factors, resistance among stakeholders and technical and economic issues. The key element, however, is the lack of knowledge about the ability of NBS to deliver a series of co-benefits in addition to their risk-reducing effects and that long-term thinking is required to see the effect of many of these co-benefits.",1

"Complex networks of relationships among and between people and nature (social-ecological networks) play an important role in sustainability; yet, we have limited empirical understanding of their temporal dynamics. We empirically examine the evolution of a social-ecological network in a common-pool resource system faced with escalating social and environmental change over the past two decades. We first draw on quantitative and qualitative data collected between 2002 and 2018 in a Papua New Guinean reef fishing community to provide contextual evidence regarding the extent of social and environmental change being experienced. We then develop a temporal multilevel exponential random graph model using complete social-ecological network data, collected in 2016 and 2018, to test key hypotheses regarding how fishing households have adapted their social ties in this context of change given their relationships with reef resources (i.e. social-ecological ties). Specifically, we hypothesized that households will increasingly form tight-knit, bonding social and social-ecological network structures (H1 and H3, respectively) with similar others (H2), and that they will seek out resourceful actors with specialized knowledge that can promote learning and spur innovation (H4). Our results depict a community that is largely 'bunkering down' and looking inward in response to mounting risk to resource-dependent livelihoods and a breakdown in the collaborative processes that traditionally sustained them. Community members are increasingly choosing to interact with others more like themselves (H2), with friends of friends (H1), and with those connected to interdependent ecological resources (H3)-in other words, they are showing a strong, increasing preference for forming bonding social-ecological network structures and interacting with like-minded, similar others. We did not find strong support for H4. Bonding network structures may decrease the risk associated with unmonitored behaviour and help to build trust, thereby increasing the probability of sustaining cooperation over time. Yet, increasing homophily and bonding ties can stifle innovation, reducing the ability to adapt to changing conditions. It can also lead to clustering, creating fault lines in the network, which can negatively impact the community's ability to mobilize and agree on/enforce social norms, which are key for managing common resources.

"Climate change will impact coral-reef fishes through effects on individual performance, trophic linkages, recruitment dynamics, population connectivity and other ecosystem processes. The most immediate impacts will be a loss of diversity and changes to fish community composition as a result of coral bleaching. Coral-dependent fishes suffer the most rapid population declines as coral is lost; however, many other species will exhibit long-term declines due to loss of settlement habitat and erosion of habitat structural complexity. Increased ocean temperature will affect the physiological performance and behaviour of coral reef fishes, especially during their early life history. Small temperature increases might favour larval development, but this could be counteracted by negative effects on adult reproduction. Already variable recruitment will become even more unpredictable. This will make optimal harvest strategies for coral reef fisheries more difficult to determine and populations more susceptible to overfishing. A substantial number of species could exhibit range shifts, with implications for extinction risk of small-range species near the margins of reef development. There are critical gaps in our knowledge of how climate change will affect tropical marine fishes. Predictions are often based on temperate examples, which may be inappropriate for tropical species. Improved projections of how ocean currents and primary productivity will change are needed to better predict how reef fish population dynamics and connectivity patterns will change. Finally, the potential for adaptation to climate change needs more attention. Many coral reef fishes have geographical ranges spanning a wide temperature gradient and some have short generation times. These characteristics are conducive to acclimation or local adaptation to climate change and provide hope that the more resilient species will persist if immediate action is taken to stabilize Earth's climate.",1

"The vulnerability, flood hazards, and exposure are three indicators to calculating and assessing flood risk in the Mekong Delta river. Flood risk assessments allows managers to understand the probability and implications of potential damage caused by floods. The vulnerability index is based on three criteria, including sensitivity and adaptive capacity related to the economic, social, and environmental aspects and benefits that floods bring to the Mekong Delta river. The flood events occurred in the years that the flood peak at Tan Chau was over 4 m, causing the most severe damage in this area. This paper will use the vulnerability index method which is the sum of the components including the sensitivity, resilience and benefits of floods to calculate and assess the flood vulnerability of 155 communes in 11 districts of An Giang province. The results showed that there are four communes were affected by average vulnerability and 151 communes with high vulnerability.",1

"Distributed parallel applications executed on heterogeneous and dynamic environments need to adapt their configuration (in terms of parallelism degree and parallelism form for each component) in response to unpredictable factors related to the physical platform and the application semantics. On emerging Cloud computing scenarios, reconfigurations induce economic costs and performance degradations on the execution. In this context, it is of paramount importance to define smart adaptation strategies able to achieve properties like control optimality (optimizing the application global QoS) and reconfiguration stability, expressed in terms of number of reconfigurations and the average time for which a configuration is not modified. In this paper we introduce a methodology to address this issue, based on Control Theory and Optimal Control foundations. We present a first validation of our approach in a simulation environment, outlining its effectiveness and feasibility.",0
"Many studies have focused on the influence of dietary supplements on gut microbiota composition, but limited research have reported their effects on specific bacterial species in the gut. Lactiplantibacillus plantarum is one of the most widely studied probiotics, with a wide range of sources and good environmental adaptability. In this study, in order to elucidate the adaptation strategies of L. plantarum to the gut of mice supplemented with carbohydrates, peptides and minerals, whole genome resequencing and intracellular metabolites detection were performed, and high-frequency mutant genes and differential metabolites were screened. The results suggested different types of dietary supplements do have different effects on L. plantarum from the gut of mice. Additionally, KEGG annotation unveiled that the effects of these dietary supplements on the gene level of L. plantarum primarily pertained to environmental information processing, while the differential metabolites were predominantly associated with metabolism. This study provided new perspectives on the adaptive mechanism of L. plantarum in response to the host's gut environment, suggesting that the diversity of the genome and metabolome of L. plantarum was correlated with dietary supplements. Furthermore, this study offered useful guidance in the effective utilization of dietary supplements.",0
"Abstract The purpose of this article is to present a theoretical discussion about the institutional dimension of the concept of adaptive governance. We discuss examples of this institutional dimension based on an analysis of the limits to the implementation of adaptive governance in Brazilian metropolises, based on: 1) the financial resources available to the environmental management of municipalities belonging to metropolitan regions; 2) the creation of an institutional arrangement for climate governance in the municipality of Rio de Janeiro. Despite the incremental aspect, the analyzed data indicate the low fiscal relevance of the environmental issue, as well as difficulties in implementing governance arrangements that succeed in providing transversal planning capacity, mechanisms for the integrated action of different agents, and incentives to an enhanced participatory dynamics in the formulation and implementation of climate policies.",1
"Long-chain fatty acids with antimicrobial properties are abundant on the skin and mucosal surfaces, where they are essential to restrict the proliferation of opportunistic pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus. These antimicrobial fatty acids (AFAs) elicit bacterial adaptation strategies, which have yet to be fully elucidated. Characterizing the pervasive mechanisms used by S. aureus to resist AFAs could open new avenues to prevent pathogen colonization. Here, we identify the S. aureus lipase Lip2 as a novel resistance factor against AFAs. Lip2 detoxifies AFAs via esterification with cholesterol. This is reminiscent of the activity of the fatty acid-modifying enzyme (FAME), whose identity has remained elusive for over three decades. In vitro, Lip2-dependent AFA-detoxification was apparent during planktonic growth and biofilm formation. Our genomic analysis revealed that prophage-mediated inactivation of Lip2 was rare in blood, nose, and skin strains, suggesting a particularly important role of Lip2 for host - microbe interactions. In a mouse model of S. aureus skin colonization, bacteria were protected from sapienic acid (a human-specific AFA) in a cholesterol- and lipase-dependent manner. These results suggest Lip2 is the long-sought FAME that exquisitely manipulates environmental lipids to promote bacterial growth in otherwise inhospitable niches.",0
"To explore how traditional knowledge acts in the soil and water conservation in mountain agricultural systems, this study selects the Shexian Dryland Stone Terraced System (SDSTS) as the study area and employs the social-ecological system (SES) framework and ecosystem service (ES) evaluation methods in a joint way. Results of the action mechanism analysis show that local farmers, as the main actors, fully utilize a variety of traditional knowledge, which constitutes a set of action situations at both the field and landscape scales. This has not only improved the soil and water conservation capacity of the SDSTS, but also met the livelihood need of the local people. Evaluation of the action outcomes further displays that the stone terraced fields have a higher capacity for soil and water conservation than other land use types and they also show a superior performance in food production. This has led to the highest comprehensive benefit per unit area found in the stone terraced fields (1.69 x 10(4) dollars center dot ha(-1)), much higher than forests (3.48 x 10(3) dollars center dot ha(-1)) and the grasslands (2.58 x 10(3) dollars center dot ha(-1)) on slopes. The traditional knowledge is proven extremely important for the SDSTS to achieve sustainable development and effective measures are thus needed to promote its inheritance and development. The combination of these two methods makes up for the shortcomings of the current traditional knowledge research, which mainly focuses on qualitative description and is lack of systematic explanation of mechanisms. The con-joint use of them also provides theoretical reference and technical support for more case studies of traditional knowledge in the future.",1
"Sheep breeding in central Tunisia remains widespread, despite the many problems it had to face since the 1970s: climate hazards, socio-economic and cultural changes and the development of cropped area. These changes have led to a decrease in forage resources from rangelands. The aim of this study was to understand how families are able to maintain sheep breeding in such a context. The study involved a survey among a sample of 60 farmers in 2012-2013. We identified four types of livestock systems. Three types are based on the raising of ewes and the production of lean or fat lambs. Transhumant pastoralists are using long-distance mobility to access rangelands with wild vegetation, managed by the State. Crop-Livestock farmers use stubble for pasture, along with other resources derived from farmed land and have a greater adaptive capacity to cope with changes. Multi-active families are the most affected by the extension of crops at the expense of rangelands. For these three systems, many farmers are thinking of decreasing their number of ewes or even giving up sheep farming, due to the difficulties they face. A fourth trader-fattener system is strongly developing, based on fattening purchased lean lambs with grain, without raising ewes. This activity is profitable in the short term but is vulnerable to price fluctuations of feed supplements.",1
"This paper analyses the vulnerability of South African agriculture to climate change and variability by developing a vulnerability index and comparing vulnerability indicators across the nine provinces of the country. Nineteen environmental and socio-economic indicators are identified to reflect the three components of vulnerability: exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. The results of the study show that the regions most exposed to climate change and variability do not always overlap with those experiencing high sensitivity or low adaptive capacity. Furthermore, vulnerability to climate change and variability is intrinsically linked with social and economic development. The Western Cape and Gauteng provinces, which have high levels of infrastructure development, high literacy rates, and low shares of agriculture in total GDP, are relatively low on the vulnerability index. In contrast, the highly vulnerable regions of Limpopo, Kwazulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape are characterised by densely populated rural areas, large numbers of small-scale farmers, high dependency on rain-fed agriculture and high land degradation. These large differences in the extent of vulnerability among provinces suggest that policymakers should develop region-specific policies and address climate change at the local level.",1
"The building sector is critical in climate change mitigation by reducing its energy consumption. At the same time, warming climate requires adaptation measures from buildings, making it necessary to study the future thermal energy demand of buildings. This paper studies the impact of climate change on the thermal energy demand of buildings in a heating dominated climate of Finland, under representative concentration pathway(RCP) climate scenarios in near- (2030), medium- (2050) and long-term (2080) horizon. Additionally, the impact of the thermal performance level of the buildings is investigated. The thermal energy demand calculation is based on overarching standards from the European energy performance of buildingsdirective. The weather scenarios present both typical and extreme weather years, applied through morphing and future weather data from the Finnish Meteorological Institute. The results show that annual thermal energy demand in Finland in 2080 can decrease up to 74.6 kWh/m2. In addition, the decrease in heating demand will be higher than the increase in cooling demand. Cooling can become the dominant peak in long-term evaluations, especially in South Finland (Vantaa) with passive buildings under RCP8.5 climate scenario. Renovation is the most efficient action to decrease energy intensity, the earliest it is done the better.",1
"Many documents have been published and webinars held on the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on food security at international levels, which tend to blur our understanding of actual dynamics on the ground. Based on a network of researchers from Cirad and its partners in a wide diversity of countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, this paper attempts to take stock of what is happening in the food and agriculture sector. The information provided allow for a more nuanced analysis when compared to international organizations' reports. While lockdown and social distancing measures have only mildly affected world trade and production of staple food, some perishable products have been wasted, unable to reach markets. The crisis emphasizes the disconnection between food production and trade and the dire situation of many poor consumers, in cities, holding informal jobs, who have been hit very hard. The crisis should help imagining short- and long-term measures to support food systems resilience along an integrated approach and adaptation strategies already developed.",1
"This work proposes to address a lack of conceptual consensus surrounding the concept of vulnerability, by fostering a minimal definition as a measure of potential future harm, and by basing it on a stochastic controlled dynamical system framework. Harm is defined as a normative judgment on a trajectory. Considering all the possible trajectories from an initial state leads to the definition of vulnerability indicators as statistics derived from the probability distribution of harm values. This framework 1) promotes a dynamic view of vulnerability by eliciting its temporal dimension and 2) clarifies the descriptive and normative aspects of a system's representation. As illustrated by a simple model of lake eutrophication, this work makes vulnerability a precise yet flexible concept which fosters discussion on trade-offs between vulnerability sources, and also on adaptation. Links with economics, with control theory, and with algorithmic methods such as dynamic programming are highlighted. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",1

"Microbial respiration determines the accumulation of reduced solutes and negative redox potential in organic sediments, favoring the mobilization of dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP), generally coprecipitated with Fe oxyhydroxides. Macrophytes releasing oxygen from the roots can contrast DIP mobility via the oxidation of anaerobic metabolism end-products. In this work, the submerged macrophyte Vallisneria spiralis was transplanted into laboratory microcosms containing sieved and homogenized organic sediments collected from a contaminated wetland. Sediments with and without plants were incubated under light and dark conditions for oxygen and DIP fluxes measurements and pore water characterization (pH, oxidation-reduction potential, DIP, dissolved Mn, and Fe). Bare sediments were net DIP sources whereas sediments with V. spiralis were weak DIP sources in the dark and large sinks in light. V. spiralis radial oxygen loss led to less negative redox potential and lower Fe, Mn, and DIP concentrations in pore water. Roots were coated by reddish plaques with large amounts of Fe, Mn, and P, exceeding internal content. The results demonstrated that at laboratory scale, the transplant of V. spiralis into polluted organic sediments, mitigates the mobility of DIP and metals through both direct and indirect effects. This, in turn, may favor sediment colonization by less-tolerant aquatic plants. Further in situ investigations, coupled with economic analyses, can evaluate this potential application as a nature-based solution to contrast eutrophication.",1
"Ghana's economy is climate sensitive as more than 80% of its agricultural production is rainfall dependent, with only 2% of irrigation potential used. This has consequences under changing climate, with the impact projected to intensify if things go in a business-as-usual scenario. The manifestation of climate change impact is evident in other sectors of the economy, which requires proactiveness to adapt and mitigate through the development and execution of national adaptation strategies. This research reviews the impact of climate change and some interventions made toward its management. The study explored peer-reviewed journals, policy documents, and technical reports for relevant materials that chronicle programmes and measures to address the challenges of climate change. The research revealed that Ghana had experienced about 1 degrees C rise in temperature over the past four decades and sea level rise with socioeconomic consequences including decreased agricultural productivity and inundation of coastal communities. Policy interventions have resulted in the introduction of several mitigative and adaptation programmes, such as building resilience in various economic sectors. The study highlighted the progress and challenges to climate change implementation programmes and future policy implementation plans. Inadequate funding of programmes and projects was identified as a critical challenge to achieving climate change policy goals and objectives. We recommend more political will from the government and stakeholders towards policy implementation and greater commitment to providing adequate funding for programmes and project implementation to ensure the success of local climate action for adaptation and mitigation, as well as for sustainable development.",1
"Southern Africa is highly vulnerable to drought because of its dependence on climate-sensitive sectors of agriculture, hydro-energy and fisheries. Recurring droughts continue to impact rural livelihoods and degrade the environment. Drought severity in southern Africa is exacerbated by poor levels of preparedness and low adaptive capacity. Whilst weather extremes and hazards are inevitable, the preparedness to manage such hazards determines their impact and whether they become disasters. Southern Africa is often caught unprepared by drought as existing early warning systems lack the drought forecasting component, which often results in reactionary interventions as opposed to well-planned and proactive response mechanisms. This study assesses the spatio-temporal changes of rainfall and aridity in southern Africa through an analysis of long-term precipitation and evaporation trends from 1960 to 2007. Stakeholder consultation was conducted in Madagascar, Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe during the peak of the 2015/16 drought, focusing on overall drought impacts, current water resource availability, existing early warning systems, adaptation mechanisms and institutional capacity to mitigate and manage droughts as part of overall disaster risk reduction strategies. Average rainfall has decreased by 26% in the region between 1960 and 2007, and aridity has increased by 11% between 1980 and 2007. The absence of drought forecasting and lack of institutional capacity to mitigate drought impede regional drought risk reduction initiatives. Existing multi-hazard early warning systems in the region focus on flooding and drought monitoring and assessment. Drought forecasting is often not given due consideration, yet it is a key component of early warning and resilience building. We propose a regional drought early warning framework, emphasising the importance of both monitoring and forecasting as being integral to a drought early warning system and building resilience to drought.",1
"To understand human evolution it is critical to clarify which adaptations enabled our colonisation of novel ecological niches. For any species climate is a fundamental source of environmental stress during range expansion. Mammalian climatic adaptations include changes in size and shape reflected in skeletal dimensions and humans fit general primate ecogeographic patterns. It remains unclear however, whether there are also comparable amounts of adaptation in humans, which has implications for understanding the relative importance of biological/behavioural mechanisms in human evolution. We compare cranial variation between prehistoric human populations from throughout Japan and ecologically comparable groups of macaques. We compare amounts of intraspecific variation and covariation between cranial shape and ecological variables. Given equal rates and sufficient time for adaptation for both groups, human conservation of non-human primate adaptation should result in comparable variation and patterns of covariation in both species. In fact, we find similar amounts of intraspecific variation in both species, but no covariation between shape and climate in humans, contrasting with strong covariation in macaques. The lack of covariation in humans may suggest a disconnect in climatic adaptation strategies from other primates. We suggest this is due to the importance of human behavioural adaptations, which act as a buffer from climatic stress and were likely key to our evolutionary success.",0
"Nowadays, urban areas are increasingly identified as strategic fields of climate change-related actions. Climate change is an increasingly complex challenge for these territories. Tackling climate change, moreover, in a sustainable way, is a priority in the European Union, which has set several ambitious short- and long-term mitigation, adaptation, and sustainability targets. It is a central issue of how society can respond to the climate emergency that is affected by and depends on the vertical and horizontal interrelations among different stakeholders, organizations, governance actors, etc., and their activities. Countries, regions, counties, and cities around the world react by developing climate strategies. The operationalization of the high-level political agreements and discourses is uncertain, and the policies in practice should also be evaluated on regional and city levels, just as the milestones of related strategic planning processes fostering local adaptive capacity. According to regional and urban governance, it is pivotal addressing not only mitigation but adaptation issues to be able to foster sustainable regional development, also considering the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) specified in the Agenda 2030. Adaptation to climate change is increasingly becoming a priority for policy action. It also has high relevance to find the synergic interrelations towards an adaptive future. This paper evaluates the recent changes in Hungarian regional and urban planning in relation to climate policy approach and reports a state of adaptation oriented spatial planning on NUTS-3 (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics) and LAU-1 (Local Administrative Units) levels. The results are based on the collection of all relevant climate change-related strategic documents on these levels in Hungary and on the analysis of specific information. There is a lack of knowledge related to the comprehensive adaptation policy and planning on regional and local levels in Hungary. The results of the evaluation show the state-of-art knowledge related to possible adaptation pathways and the various engagement level for climate policy approach on different spatial levels in Hungary. In the case of the examined research area, the development of more mitigation oriented planning documents and low level of adaptation measures and monitoring process management tools is seen as critical.",1
"Urbanization has increased heat in the urban environment, with many consequences for human health and wellbeing. Managing climate change in part through increasing vegetation is desired by many cities to mitigate current and future heat related issues. However, little information is available on what influences the current effectiveness and availability of vegetation for local cooling. In this study, we identified the variation in the interacting relationships among vegetation (normalized difference vegetation index), socioeconomic status (neighborhood income), elevation and land surface temperature (LST) to identify how vegetation based surface cooling services change throughout the pronounced coastal to desert climate gradient of the Los Angeles, CA metropolitan region, a megacity of >18 million residents. A key challenge for understanding variation in vegetation as a climate change adaptation tool spanning neighborhood to megacity scales is developing new big data analytical tools. We used structural equation modeling (SEM) to quantify the interacting relationships among socio-economic status data obtained from government census data, elevation and new LST and vegetation data obtained from an airborne imaging campaign conducted in 2013 for the urban and suburban areas across a series of fifteen climate zones. Vegetation systematically increased in cooling effectiveness from 6.06 to 31.77 degrees with increasing distance from the coast. Vegetation and neighborhood income were positively correlated throughout all climate zones with a peak in the relationship occurring near 25 km from the coast. Because of the interaction between these two relationships, we also found that higher income neighborhoods were cooler and that this effect peaked at about 30 km from the coast. These results show the availability and effectiveness of vegetation on the local climate varies tremendously throughout the Los Angeles, CA metropolitan area. Further, using the more inland climate zones as future analogs for more coastal zones, suggests that in the warmer climate conditions projected for the region the effectiveness of vegetation for regional cooling may increase thus acting as a localized negative feedback mechanism.

"Transhumance is a form of extensive livestock production that involves seasonal movements among ecological zones or landscape types. Rangeland-based transhumance constitutes an important social and economic relationship to nature in many regions of the world, including across the Western US. However, social and ecological drivers of change are reshaping transhumant practices, and managers must adapt to increased demands for public rangeland use. Specifically, concerns for wildlife conservation have led to reduced access to seasonal public lands grazing for western US livestock producers. To understand how managers adapt to loss of grazing areas (called seasonal ranges) we create agroecological calendars from manager records spanning 35 years (1986-2021) at the US Sheep Experiment Station in Idaho and Montana, US. The calendars illustrate how a loss of winter and summer ranges after 2013 coincided with shifts in the operation's adaptive strategies, leading to more grazing of fall crop residue and purchased winter feed, and reducing flexibility to move livestock to cope with variable forage conditions. These changes shifted the job duties and experiences of farm workers and managers, and raised several new questions related to sheep production and vegetation management outcomes that merit future research. Transhumant system transformation has implications for human relationships with nature, rural communities, sheep genetics, production, and vegetation communities. For livestock operations that rely on government-managed lands to sustain transhumant traditions, innovative forms of collaboration and social adaptation that help secure access to seasonal ranges will be as important as technological innovations to address biodiversity conservation, climate change adaptation, and food system sustainability issues that are reshaping access to grazing lands.",1

"This paper aims to identify how targeted asset transfers help to build adaptive capacity and adaptive actions of the urban extreme poor to climate change phenomena. This paper explores the theoretical debates of community-based adaptation approach and failure of such approach to address urban extreme poor. The empirical evidence of these theoretical debates will be drawn from two informal settlements of Dhaka city, where a targeted asset transfer project has been implementing since 2009. This paper explains that urban extreme poor usually work as unskilled labour and lack different livelihood capitals; and climate change is an increasingly important influence exacerbating an already vulnerable livelihood context. There is growing recognition in the literature that poor urban people and communities are adapting to climate change in physical and behavioural terms. But, in the case of urban extreme poor these adaptation approaches are delivering short-term survival strategies disregarding the notion of wellbeing in the medium to long-term perspectives. It is also evident that community level initiatives structurally reproduce the exclusion of the urban extreme poor. However, poverty literatures acknowledge that poverty-centred approaches could help to reduce vulnerability. As urban extreme poor are significantly more resource constrained, it is reasonable to assert that targeted asset transfers could be a poverty-centred adaptation approach in a changing climate. Targeted asset transfers approaches are the outcomes of recent social protection revolution that especially consider accumulation of physical, financial, human, and social capital in order to build adaptive capacity of the urban extreme poor. This adaptive capacity of the extreme poor may facilitate adjustments in assets, livelihoods, behaviours, and technologies in order to reduce future climate vulnerability. In this context, this paper seeks to answer whether targeted asset transfer approaches can be considered as effective poverty-centred adaptation approaches for the urban extreme poor or not.",1
"This paper examines the topic of financing adaptation in future climate change policies. A major question is whether adaptation in developing countries should be financed under the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), or whether funding should come from other sources. We present an overview of financial resources and propose the employment of a two-track approach: one track that attempts to secure climate change adaptation funding under the UNFCCC; and a second track that improves mainstreaming of climate risk management in development efforts. Developed countries would need to demonstrate much greater commitment to the funding of adaptation measures if the UNFCCC were to cover a substantial part of the costs. The mainstreaming of climate change adaptation could follow a risk management path, particularly in relation to disaster risk reduction. 'Climate-proofing' of development projects that currently do not consider climate and weather risks could improve their sustainability.",1
"Poorly damped low-frequency inter-area oscillations are a major concern in large power systems. Wide-area damping controllers which modulate power flow using power electronic systems like HVDC links and FACTS can be used to improve the damping of the critical modes in a targeted manner. These controllers use wide-area measurements, which are communicated from several remote locations. The communication time delay is generally variable in nature, and the data from different locations arrive at the controller with different delays. The overall delay in synthesizing the controller input signal affects the closed-loop damping performance. This paper proposes a delay-handling strategy and derives a discrete-time model which is used to characterize its performance. The relative insensitivity of the mode shape of swing modes to the damping controller is used to facilitate a simplified analysis. A strategy for the adaptation of controller gain when the delays are excessive and persistent is also presented. A case study is presented to illustrate the delay-handling and gain adaptation strategies.",0
"The Integrated Agrometeorological Prediction System (IAPS) was a two-year project for the development of the long term forecast (LRF) for agricultural producers. Using LRF in decision-making, to reduce the risks and seize the opportunities, represents short-term adaptation to climate change. High-resolution ensemble forecasts (51 forecasts) were made for a period of 7 months and were initiated on the first day of each month. For the initial testing of the capacity of LRF to provide useful information for producers, 2017 was chosen as the test year as it had a very hot summer and severe drought, which caused significant impacts on agricultural production. LRF was very useful in predicting the variables which bear the memory of the longer period, such are growing degree days for the prediction of dates of the phenophases' occurrences and the soil moisture of deeper soil layers as an indicator for the drought. Other project activities included field observations, communication with producers, web portal development, etc. Our results showed that the selected priority forecasting products were also identified by the producers as being the highest weather-related risks, the operational forecast implementation with the products designed for the use in agricultural production is proven to be urgent and necessary for decision-making, and required investments are affordable. The total cost of the full upgrade of agrometeorological climate services to meet current needs (including monitoring, seamless forecasting system development and the development of tools for information dissemination) was found to be about three orders of magnitude lower than the assessed losses in agricultural production in the two extreme years over the past decade.",1
"Energy supply security is a multifaceted challenge for all countries and especially for small island nations that might have limited adaptive capacity. Previous studies showed that islands experience energy scarcity and isolation from energy markets due to their remote location making energy supply security a challenging issue. We estimate energy supply diversity and concentration for 44 islands in order to provide an island specific benchmark approach for energy supply security. We use established metrics Shannon-Wiener index (SWI), Herfindahl-Hirschman index (HHI) with Energy Information Administration (EIA) fuel mix data. To confront the issues of supply security and sustainability we test energy diversity against energy and emissions intensity. The global character of the research along with the wide range of islands covered allows useful comparisons between countries and for a means of benchmarking against the indices while creating certain defined country clusters. Overall it is found that average island energy intensity increased by 23.4% with a corresponding increase of 12.4% on their emissions intensity for the period 2000-2015. On the other hand, diversity has improved by 21.3% (SWI) and by 2% (HHI) since 2000.

"Urban flash floods represent one of the most challenging issue for city councils among climate risks: as they are expected to become more and more frequent in the changing climate local scenarios, flash floods are one of the most alarming issue for urban citizens and the quality of their lifestyles; moreover, as urban runoff is closely linked to urban land uses and related soil sealing levels, urban flash floods prevention policies deeply concern the local capacity to tackle with environmental integrated strategies, addressing the institutional capability to put them actually into practice. In this framework the integrated approach developed by the City of Rome, in Italy, shows a positive case of those tools whose horizontal replicability, environmentally oriented and scientifically sounded basis are needed both to face specific floods risks and to deal with the territorial dimension of climate adaptation's strategies.",1
"Cellular senescence is known as an anti-tumor barrier and is characterized by a number of determinants including cell cycle arrest, senescence associated beta-galactosidase activity and secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators. Senescent cells are also subjected to enlargement, cytoskeleton-mediated shape changes and organelle alterations. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for these last changes remain still uncharacterized. Herein, we have identified the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) as a player controlling some morphological aspects of the senescent phenotype. We show that senescent fibroblasts exhibit ER expansion and mild UPR activation, but conserve an ER stress adaptive capacity similar to that of exponentially growing cells. By genetically invalidating the three UPR sensors in senescent fibroblasts, we demonstrated that ATF6 alpha signaling dictates senescence-associated cell shape modifications. We also show that ER expansion and increased secretion of the pro-inflammatory mediator IL6 were partly reversed by silencing ATF6a in senescent cells. Moreover, ATF6a drives the increase of senescence associated-beta-galactosidase activity. Collectively, these findings unveil a novel and central role for ATF6a in the establishment of morphological features of senescence in normal human primary fibroblasts.",0

"Spatial simulations of crop growth under climate change have been limited to researchers who have access to the resources for high performance computing. The objective of this study was to develop an orchestration aid system for concurrent gridded simulations of crop growth, which would support the design of climate change adaptation options on crop production without expertise in distributed computing. The orchestration aid system was designed to help a user build a set of virtualized cluster computers using a simple input file, which would require little expertise in distributed computing, rather than manual configuration. The orchestration aid system, which was referred to as GROWLERS-kube, was implemented to launch multiple sets of gridded simulations using pods or containers managed by Kubernetes. As a case study, GROWLER-kube was executed using 16 Raspberry Pi 4 computers to perform 120 sets of the gridded simulations under diverse crop management options, including varying planting date and cultivar, for the period from 2001 to 2010. The wall time or the elapsed time for the given sets of the gridded simulation differed by configuration of virtualized cluster computers, such as the number of pods used for server and client nodes, although the total number of physical nodes were identical. For example, the wall time difference between virtualized cluster computer sets was about 28.9% when 15 worker nodes were used. In particular, the acceleration of the gridded simulations was at maximum using a large number of the virtualized cluster computers with a small number of nodes. It was found that the spatial distribution of planting dates and cultivars was similar to that of a previous study based on field experiments mostly in regions where rice is usually grown. These results suggest that GROWLERS-kube would facilitate the spatial assessment of climate change impact on crop production without considerable effort and expertise in distributed computing, which would aid a researcher to focus on the design of adaptation strategies.",1
"This article analyses the legal adaptive capacity for increasing sustainable fish aquaculture production in EU-Finland. Currently, fish aquaculture is driven by increasing global demand of fish, declining natural fisheries, food security and blue growth policies. At the same time, environmental policies such as the EU Water Framework Directive and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive set tightening legal-ecological requirements for the industry's nutrient emissions. Against this background, the success of blue growth policies related to aquaculture - and the hope of reconciling competing interests at sea - boil down to measures available for dealing with excess nutrients. In line with the mitigation hierarchy, the article establishes four alternative pathways for the fish aquaculture industry to grow without increasing its environmental nutrient footprint significantly, and evaluates the legal adaptive capacity and the legal risks attached to these pathways.",1
"Background and Objectives. Previous studies have reported comparable efficacy for ropivacaine and bupivacaine when used for labor analgesia at concentrations of 2.5 mg/mL. In this multicenter study, we assessed ropivacaine at the commercially available concentration of 2 mg/mL (0.2%) for labor pain management. Methods. After Institutional Review Board approval and informed consent, 128 women at term were randomly assigned to receive ropivacaine at one of the four infusion rates via a lumbar epidural catheter. Analgesia was initiated with a 5-mL test dose, followed by injections of 5-15 mt of 2 mg/mL ropivacaine. The continuous infusion was then started at 4, 6, 8, or 10 mL/hour. Rescue analgesia was provided with 5-mL top-up injections as necessary to provide maternal comfort. Pain relief was assessed by using a visual analog pain scale (VAPS) and motor block was assessed by using a modified Bromage scale. Results. All infusion regimens effectively decreased VAPS, and most patients in all groups had minimal or no motor block at the end of the first stage of labor. Mean total number of the top-up injections required per patient were 3, 2, 1.5, and 1.4 respectively, in the 4, 6, 8, and 10-mL/hour groups (P < .05, 4 mL/hour vs. all other groups). Despite receiving more total bolus dosages, the 4 mL/hour group had less motor block in the lower extremities (P < .05). Apgar scores and neurological adaptive capacity scores were similar for all groups. Conclusions. The 2 mg/mL of ropivacaine produces satisfactory labor analgesia at epidural infusion rates of 4, 6, 8, and 10 mL/hour, provided supplemental bolus dosages are available. Clinically, a rate of 6 mL/hour may be the lowest effective rate that provides the best combination of pain relief, motor block, and rebolusing, although rates of 8 and 10 mL/hour produced similar results.",0
"Climate change may affect human health through multiple and interactive pathways that include safe water scarcity. However, impacts of climate change-induced water scarcity on health and well-being are complex. About 80% of illnesses in developing countries are attributed to unsafe drinking water and waterborne diseases. In Southwestern Bangladesh, lack of safe drinking water is a severe crisis due to climate change. The study investigated the impacts of climate change on water resources and human health in a coastal area. A questionnaire survey was carried out in two villages of Shymnagar upazila on the southwestern coast to investigate the present status of safe water sources and health care facilities and their impacts on the local community. The results show that the local community believes that climate change is having substantial impacts on freshwater sources and health. More than 70% of the respondents identified diarrhea, dysentery, and skin diseases as the prime waterborne health risks that occur through climate-related safe water scarcity. By synthesizing the ground data, we suggest pathways to health adaptation to climate change effects and safe water scarcity through locally available adaptive practices such as the use of pond sand filters, rainwater harvesting, and importing potable water with the active participation of the government, nongovernmental organizations, and communities.",1
"Most previous studies investigating the interplay of ocean acidification (OA) and heavy metal on marine phytoplankton were only conducted in short-term, which may provide conservative estimates of the adaptive capacity of them. Here, we examined the physiological responses of long-term (similar to 900 generations) OA-adapted and non-adapted populations of the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum to different concentrations of the two heavy metals Cd and Cu. Our results showed that long-term OA selected populations exhibited significantly lower growth and reduced photosynthetic activity than ambient CO2 selected populations at relatively high heavy metal levels. Those findings suggest that the adaptations to high CO2 results in an increased sensitivity of the marine diatom to toxic metal exposure. This study provides evidence for the costs and the cascading consequences associated with the adaptation of phytoplankton to elevated CO2 conditions, and improves our understanding of the complex interactions of future OA and heavy metal pollution in marine waters.",1
"The quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees enabled by the new IEEE 802.11a/e Wireless LAN (WLAN) standard are specifically targeting the real-time transmission of multimedia content over the wireless medium. Since video data consume the largest part of the available bitrate compared to other media, optimization of video streaming for this new standard is a significant factor for the successful deployment of practical systems. Delay-constrained streaming of fully-scalable video over IEEE 802.11a/e WLANs is of great interest for many multimedia applications. The new medium access control (MAC) protocol of IEEE 802.11e is called the Hybrid Coordination Function (HCF) and, in this paper, we will specifically consider the problem of video transmission over HCF Controlled Channel Access (HCCA). A cross-layer optimization across the MAC and application layers of the OSI stack is used in order to exploit the features provided by the combination of the new HCCA standard with new versatile scalable video coding algorithms. Specifically, we propose an optimized and scalable HCCA-based admission control for delay-constrained video streaming applications that leads to a larger number of stations being simultaneously admitted (without quality reduction to any video flow). Subsequently, given the allocated transmission opportunity, each station deploys an optimized Application-MAC-PHY adaptation, scheduling, and protection strategy that is facilitated by the fine-grain layering provided by the scalable bitstream. Given that each video flow needs to always comply with the predetermined (a priori negotiated) traffic specification parameters, this cross-layer strategy enables graceful quality degradation whenever the channel conditions or the video sequence characteristics change. For instance, it is demonstrated that the proposed cross-layer protection and bitstream adaptation strategies facilitate QoS token rate adaptation under link adaptation mechanisms that utilize different physical layer transmission rates. The expected gains offered by the optimized solutions proposed in this paper are established theoretically, as well as through simulations.",0

"Collective adaptation' has recently become a widely used concept in climate change science and advocacy work. Yet, the current engagement with collective adaptation suffers from a few shortcomings: While the debate has been normative for the largest part, a coherent conceptual framing and theoretical engagement have been underdeveloped, hampering the empirical assessment of the extent and patterns of collective adaptation as well as the factors that foster or hinder it. In addition, the majority of emerging empirical assessments are concerned with rather homogenous sociocultural communities, while collective adaptation in heterogeneous settings such as urban melting pots has been far less in the focus - even though the most heterogeneous neighborhoods are often those with the highest vulnerability, least resources and gravest lack of formal adaptation. Sociocultural diversity has the potential to foster resilience through integrating a multitude of perspectives but, at the same time, presents a challenge for trust-building and collaboration. The paper develops and illustrates a heuristic conceptual framework on different types of collective adaptation and their formation as well as mobilization in socioculturally diverse settings. It is meant to help guide future research and inform policy debates in what is a critical decade for climate change adaptation, particularly in an increasingly diverse world.",1
"Flood and water management governance may be enhanced through partnership working, intra- and cross organisational collaborations, and wide stakeholder participation. Nonetheless, barriers associated with ineffective communication, fragmented responsibilities and 'siloed thinking' restrict open dialogue and discussion. The Learning and Action Alliance (LAA) framework may help overcome these barriers by enabling effective engagement through social learning, and facilitating targeted actions needed to deliver innovative solutions to environmental problems. By increasing the adaptive capacity of decision-makers and participants, social learning through LAAs may lead to concerted action and sustained processes of behavioural change. In this paper, we evaluate the LAA framework as a catalyst for change that supports collaborative working and facilitates transition to more sustainable flood risk management. We use a case study in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK, to demonstrate how the LAA framework brought together disparate City stakeholders to co-produce new knowledge, negotiate innovative actions and, ultimately, work towards implementing a new vision for sustainable urban flood risk management. The shared vision of Newcastle as a 'Blue-Green City' that emerged is founded on a strong platform for social learning which increased organisations' and individuals' capacities to manage differences in perspectives and behaviours, reframe knowledge, and make collective decisions based on negotiation and conflict resolution. Broad recommendations based on lessons learned from the Newcastle LAA are presented to aid other cities and regions in establishing and running social learning platforms.",1
"Temperature increment is one of the most visible aspects of climate change. Reservoirs in northern Patagonia are the main location for rainbow trout cage aquaculture activities in Argentina and here, surface water temperature shows an increment that despite leading towards better growth rates, also provokes lack of ovulation, atresia and a partial or total absence of spawning during the breeding season. During the early life history, low survival rates at hatching and first feeding are also observed. The increase in market size (> 2 kg) has changed management practices, minimizing the difference between brood stock and individuals destined for consumption. Thus, the present situation differs deeply from carrying capacities forecasted few years ago and this analysis attempts to contribute to management policies including the idea of adaptation to climate change in the making of decisions.",1
"Climatic changes have increased the world-wide frequency of extreme weather events such as heat waves, cold spells, floods, storms and droughts. These extreme events potentially affect the health status of millions of people, increasing disease and death. Since mitigation of climate change is a long and complex process, emphasis has recently been placed on the measures required for adaptation. Although the principles underlying these measures are universal, preparedness plans and policies need to be tailored to local conditions. In this paper, we conducted a review of the literature on the possible health consequences of extreme weather events in Israel, where the conditions are characteristic of the Mediterranean region. Strong evidence indicates that the frequency and duration of several types of extreme weather events are increasing in the Mediterranean Basin, including Israel. We examined the public health policy implications for adaptation to climate change in the region, and proposed public health adaptation policy options. Preparedness for the public health impact of increased extreme weather events is still relatively limited and clear public health policies are urgently needed. These include improved early warning and monitoring systems, preparedness of the health system, educational programs and the living environment. Regional collaboration should be a priority.",1

"Understanding the climatic drivers of present-day agricultural yields is critical for prioritizing adaptation strategies to climate change. However, unpacking the contribution of different environmental stressors remains elusive in large-scale observational settings in part because of the lack of an extensive long-term network of soil moisture measurements and the common seasonal concurrence of droughts and heat waves. In this study, we link state-of-the-art land surface model data and fine-scale weather information with a long panel of county-level yields for six major US crops (1981-2017) to unpack their historical and future climatic drivers. To this end, we develop a statistical approach that flexibly characterizes the distinct intra-seasonal yield sensitivities to high-frequency fluctuations of soil moisture and temperature. In contrast with previous statistical evidence, we directly elicit an important role of water stress in explaining historical yields. However, our models project the direct effect of temperature-which we interpret as heat stress-remains the primary climatic driver of future yields under climate change.",1
"Background: The leaders of health care organizations are grappling with rising expenses and surging demands for health services. In response, they are increasingly embracing artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to improve patient care delivery, alleviate operational burdens, and efficiently improve health care safety and quality. Objective: In this paper, we map the current literature and synthesize insights on the role of leadership in driving AI transformation within health care organizations. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive search across several databases, including MEDLINE (via Ovid), PsycINFO (viaOvid), CINAHL (via EBSCO), Business Source Premier (via EBSCO), and Canadian Business & Current Affairs (via ProQuest),spanning articles published from 2015 to June 2023 discussing AI transformation within the health care sector. Specifically, we focused on empirical studies with a particular emphasis on leadership. We used an inductive, thematic analysis approach to qualitatively map the evidence. The findings were reported in accordance with the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines. Results: A comprehensive review of 2813 unique abstracts led to the retrieval of 97 full-text articles, with 22 included for detailed assessment. Our literature mapping reveals that successful AI integration within healthcare organizations requires leadership engagement across technological, strategic, operational, and organizational domains. Leaders must demonstrate a blend of technical expertise, adaptive strategies, and strong interpersonal skills to navigate the dynamic healthcare landscape shaped by complex regulatory, technological, and organizational factors. Conclusions: In conclusion, leading AI transformation in healthcare requires a multidimensional approach, with leadership across technological, strategic, operational, and organizational domains. Organizations should implement a comprehensive leadership development strategy, including targeted training and cross-functional collaboration, to equip leaders with the skills needed for AI integration. Additionally, when upskilling or recruiting AI talent, priority should be given to individuals with a strong mix of technical expertise, adaptive capacity, and interpersonal acumen, enabling them to navigate the unique complexities of the healthcare environment.",0
"Plant lifespan has important evolutionary, physiological, and ecological implications related to population persistence, community stability, and resilience to ongoing environmental change impacts. Although biologists have long been puzzled over the extraordinary variation in plant lifespan and its causes, our understanding of interspecific variability in plant lifespan and the key internal and external factors influencing longevity remains limited. Here, we demonstrate the concurrent impacts of environmental, morphological, physiological, and anatomical constraints on interspecific variation in longevity among > 300 vascular dicot plant species naturally occurring at an elevation gradient (2800-6150 m) in the western Himalayas. First, we show that plant longevity (ranging from 1 to 100 years) is largely related to species' habitat preferences. Ecologically stressful habitats such as alpine and subnival host long-lived species, while productive ruderal and wetland habitats contain a higher proportion of shorter-lived species. Second, longevity is influenced by growth form with monocarpic forbs having the shortest lifespan and woody shrubs having the highest. Small-statured cushion plants with compact canopies and deep roots, most found on cold and infertile alpine and subnival soils, had a higher chance of achieving longevity. Third, plant traits reflecting plant adaptations to stress and disturbance affect interspecific differences in plant longevity. We show that longevity and growth are negatively correlated. Slow-growing species are those that have a higher chance of reaching a high age. Finally, higher longevity was associated with high leaf carbon and phosphorus, low root phosphorus and nitrogen, and with large bark-xylem ratio. Our findings suggest that plant longevity in high elevation is intricately determined by a combination of habitat preferences and growth form, as well as the plant growth rate and physiological processes.",1
"To pursue just, inclusive, and participatory climate adaptation planning and policy, it is important to understand both regional climate trends and the ecological services that reduce vulnerability and exposure to climate risks at the community level. Rapidly growing cities like Tijuana and San Diego are doubly exposed to climate change because they have fewer resources to confront them and yet responsible for basic services that support everyday life of their residents, challenges that are complicated by the divided institutional and social context of an international border region. In the binational context, the regional community is fragmented by institutional, academic, and cultural factors, leading to adaptation planning that stops at the border despite the shared ecological setting of human settlements. This fragmentation is particularly dangerous for climate adaptation planning because it obscures inequalities as well as opportunities contained in the binational region. To address this deficit, we have synthesized information from a variety of regional spatial datasets to construct a continuous binational social vulnerability index (BSVI) at the census tract level across the San Diego-Tijuana border region. This paper details the datasets and methodology used to create the BSVI and explores some of the preliminary results of the analysis by juxtaposing this score with spatially explicit information on vegetation cover and climate projections of heat and rainfall extremes across the region. We close with a discussion on use of this research as a tool for local environmental justice and regional adaptation.",1

"Climate change is undoubtedly one of the biggest crises that humanity is facing today. There is a robust scientific consensus that human-induced climate change is occurring not only in the Western Cape but around the world. The objective of this research was to assess the impact of climate change on primary agriculture and food security. The paper is based on a literature review. A variety of literature reviews, for example, 11 government reports and 21 journal articles including experience outside Western Cape, were consulted to enrich the local experience regarding the impact of climate change on agriculture. The results indicated that many dams had low water levels (40%) during 2016/2017, which reduced crop yields including grapes. Droughts, which affected both smallholder and commercial farmers, are now a common phenomenon. Livestock production has declined over time, with small stock, the beef and dairy industry being the most affected. The paper concludes by highlighting climate adaptation and mitigation interventions and strategies for both crops and livestock production in the Western Cape. The major recommendations included scaling up on the use of organic matter to avoid burning and creating gas emissions to the atmosphere, the effective use of livestock manure and the use of appropriate and adaptable seed varieties, managing the manure of the livestock to assist in mulching to reduce water loss through evaporation and using adaptable seeds.

"Extreme heat events in China are occurring more frequently due to global warming. However, there is a lack of comprehensive studies analyzing the movement direction and factor interaction of extreme heat events in different regions of China. Based on daily temperature data from 2252 meteorological stations in China from 1980 to 2021, three extreme heat indicators were calculated: Hot days (SU35), Tropical nights (TR20), and Extreme maximum temperature (TXx). The study updated and compared the characteristics of spatiotemporal evolution and driving factors of extreme heat events in China and its seven geographical regions. The results show that: (1) SU35 and TR20 increase faster in summer, while TXx increases faster in winter. Nighttime high -temperature events have increased at a faster rate. (2) Extreme heat events in North, Northeast, and Northwest China have gradually moved southward and eastward, while in Central, East, and South China, such events have moved northward. (3) In northeast and northwest China, the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO) is a strong driving force for extreme heat events, while urbanization is the most potent driving force in the remaining regions. The interaction between urbanization and atmospheric circulation, including AMO, Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and East Atlantic/West Russia (EA/WR), is non-linear or double factor enhancement and exhibits significant spatial heterogeneity. These results will be significant for urban adaptation to climate change and sustainable development.",1

"To foster the implementation of Mexico's adaptation component of its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) under the Paris Agreement, both its nationwide payment for ecosystem services (PES) program and its National Strategy for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (ENAREDD+) are regarded by the Ministry of Environment as solutions to improve the economic feasibility of adaptation measures. Mexico is reallocating its public expenditure to attend country-wide social needs causing budgetary constraints, which hinders PES and ENAREDD+ as funding sources. This led the National Institute of Ecology and Climate Change (INECC) to consider a PES with a matching funds approach to provide sufficient financial resources for adaptation measures. To estimate the available funds, INECC developed an exercise of economic valuation of ecosystem services. The watershed of Puerto Vallarta in Jalisco, Mexico, was the chosen location given its ecological and touristic importance and because of its urgent need to implement adaptation measures due to its heighted vulnerability to climate change. This article intends to showcase the value that upstream ecosystem services provide to tourism, the potential to implement adaptation measures in the region and to estimate local available funds to develop ecosystem-based adaptation measures (EbA). A literature review was conducted to understand the regional environmental, social, and economic dynamics and to identify the main ecosystem services; then, the value of ecosystem services was estimated via the willingness to pay and accept (WTP and WTA) using contingent valuation. Also economic data regarding forestry and agriculture was collected to calculate the forest conservation opportunity cost. The results showed that tourist and residents would be willing to pay circa $150 million USD per year and farmers would be willing to accept circa $75 million USD. This evidences the potential to implement forest conservation activities that will contribute to adaptation and mitigation objectives of Mexico's NDC.",1
"We propose rate and power adaptation strategies to optimize data transmission over fading channels in a spectrum sharing system operating under average received-interference constraint at the licensed user (primary user). Specifically, considering availability of the channel state information (CSI) pertaining to the secondary link and spectrum-sensing information about the activity state of the primary user, we investigate two adaptation policies at the secondary user's transmitter, namely, variable power and variable rate and power, over Rayleigh fading channels. The adaptation policies are obtained by maximizing the achievable capacity under said constraint and bit error rate (BER) requirements in multilevel quadrature amplitude modulation (M-QAM). We asses the benefits of using soft-sensing information about the primary user's activity on rate and power adaptation in spectrum sharing systems, and provide numerical results and comparisons illustrating performance for different operating scenarios.",0
