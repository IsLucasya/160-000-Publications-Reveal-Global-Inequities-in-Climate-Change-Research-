"Assessing the extent to which all bio-fuels that are claimed to be renewable are in fact renewable is essential because producing such renewable fuels itself requires some amount of non-renewable energy (NE) and materials. Using hybrid life cycle analysis (LCA)-from raw material collection to delivery of pellets to end users-the energy cost of wood pellet production in China was estimated at 1.35 J/J, of which only 0.09 J was derived from NE, indicating that only 0.09 J of NE is required to deliver 1 J of renewable energy into society and showing that the process is truly renewable. Most of the NE was consumed during the conversion process (46.21%) and delivery of pellets to end users (40.69%), during which electricity and diesel are the two major forms of NE used, respectively. Sensitivity analysis showed that the distance over which the pellets are transported affects the cost of NE significantly. Therefore the location of the terminal market and the site where wood resources are available are crucial to saving diesel.",1
"Since the official submission of the National Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris agreement framework, a set of studies attempted to assess the energy and economic impacts on NDCs by using large-scale energy-economy models, both at the national and global level. This paper presents a novel approach to quantify policy impacts of NDCs, by combining a set of technology-rich country-level models for major economies with an economy-wide global CGE model. The methodology enhances the credibility of global model-based scenarios, by complementing it with detailed representation of country-level policy priorities and structural heterogeneities, captured by national-level models. It also improves the consistency between national short-to-medium term policy plans with global long-term climate objectives. Results indicate that energy efficiency improvements and increased penetration of RES are the main contributors to emission reduction induced by NDCs. The role of emission reduction options differentiates by country, depending on national socio-economic objectives, energy resource endowment and climate policy ambition. The Paris pledges are found to be consistent with robust economic growth both in developed and in emerging economies. NDCs result in a more labour-intensive economy driven by RES expansion, while major clean energy manufacturers (EU, China) have the potential to improve their balance of trade.",1
"An auxiliary coordinated control approach focusing on transient voltage stability is proposed in this paper. The concept is based on support vector machine (SVM) classifier and multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) model predictive control (MPC) on the high penetration renewable power system. To achieve the objective, the voltage stability condition of the power system is predicted by the SVM classifier first, using measured synchrophasor data in the power system. Next, the control strategy is triggered by the prediction results. The designed auxiliary MPC strategy will augment the existing control variables aiming to keep transient voltage stability. To validate the proposed approach, the Kundur two-area power system with a wind plant is built and the numerical results demonstrate the feasibility, effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method.",1
"The paper presents several power quality issues in an islanded microgrid, regarding the frequency regulation. A load-frequency control technique has been implemented, which consists in a special device, named dump load (DL) that draws the extra power from the generators, transforming it into heat through a power electronics device. This paper compares more DL topologies from the power quality point of view, and suggests a new DL configuration developed by the authors. The simulations and experimental results show the effectiveness of the solution.",0
"Phasing out the use of coal for power generation is an important concern for energy policy in the context of green transition. Despite the efforts of other nations, the role of China in the global phase-out of coal power remains crucial. Our study with a sub-national focus sheds important new light on the drivers and decision-making dynamics of exiting of coal power use in China. Based on a case study of closures of coal power plants in China's Guangdong province, we find that under certain circumstances, governments - especially those in the provincial and city levels - can and do act as change agents when it comes to retirement of coal fired power stations. Our study reveals a number of push and pull mechanisms that governments have utilized to overcome the resistance of incumbent power generation companies, primarily based on developmental considerations. By identifying the drivers and enabling mechanisms of phasing out the use of coal power in a significant sub-national region in China, our study contributes to both of the sustainability transition literature and the energy policy literature.",1
"Intensive extraction of forest resources lowers biodiversity and endangers the functioning of forest ecosystems. As such, alternative management regimes have emerged, aspiring to promote forest biodiversity and nature protection in managed forests. Among them, continuous cover forestry, (i.e. selective logging), has received considerable attention and is being promoted by some researchers and NGOs. Yet, the full consequences of banning clear-cuts (i.e. rotation forestry) and replacing it entirely with continuous cover forest remains uncertain. We explore how restricting forest management alternatives (either rotation forestry or continuous cover forestry) will affect landscape-scale forest multifunctionality at a range of harvesting levels. We evaluate multifunctionality as a combination of recreational ecosystem services, climate change mitigation, habitat availability for vertebrates, and red-listed dead wood dependent species. Our results show that restricting forest management alternatives have a negative impact on forest multifunctionality at all harvesting levels when compared to the case with no restrictions. Using only continuous cover forestry management alternatives resulted in higher multifunctionality than the case when only rotation forestry management alternatives were used. We also show that maximizing multifunctionality using all management alternatives led to high proportion of continuous cover forestry over the landscape. We conclude that banning clear-cuts does not promote forest biodiversity and multifunctionality at the landscape scale, especially if there is a requirement for high economic benefits from the forest. However, we recommend that continuous cover forestry should be considered as a primary management alternative, with selective application of rotation forestry wisely planned at the landscape scale.",1
"This paper examines the drivers of private investment in renewable energy by source of financing for 13 economies over the period 2008-2018, with a focus on a sub-panel of Asian economies. Sources of financing - asset finance, corporate research and development (R&D), public market, and venture capital and private equity - vary not only across years and renewable energy sources, but also across countries. Using a fixed effects panel model, this paper provides a first quantitative estimate of the effect of government renewable energy policies on private investment across different sources of financing, with four main findings. First, while government expenditure on R&D positively affects private investment from asset finance and corporate R&D, it is not the most important driver in terms of the magnitude of the elasticity. Second, feed-in tariffs have a particularly strong effect on stimulating renewable energy investment financed through public markets, with the findings particularly strong for the Asian sub-sample. Third, tax incentives have a mixed impact across sources of financing. Fourth, technology costs and energy prices have considerable effects on driving renewable energy investment from asset finance, with the impact notably more pronounced for the Asian sub-sample. Key policy insights To maximize the impact of government R&D, policies should aim to facilitate a smoother investment environment for the private sector in the areas of asset finance and corporate R&D. This could include targeted subsidies and tax relief measures. Enhanced FIT mechanisms should be developed, particularly in Asia, to leverage greater investment financed via publicly quoted markets. This could also include more favourable initial fiscal incentives and terms of agreement. Tax incentives should be used with caution. While tax incentives have a positive effect on investment in renewable energy overall, they may negatively affect investment financed by corporate R&D and venture capital and private equity, i.e. private financing sources that are crucial for technology R&D and manufacturing scale-up. Countries with lower regulatory quality may need to offer higher FIT rates for policies to be effective in attracting private investment.",1
"In recent years, the increasing number of natural disasters has raised concerns about the sustainability of our planet's future. As young people comprise the generation that will suffer from the negative effects of climate change, they have become involved in a new climate activism that is also gaining interest in the public debate thanks to the Fridays for Future (FFF) movement. This paper analyses the results of a survey of 1,138 young people in a southern Italian region to explore their perceptions of the extent of environmental problems and their participation in protests of green movements such as the FFF. The statistical analyses perform an ordinal classification tree using an original impurity measure considering both the ordinal nature of the response variable and the heterogeneity of its ordered categories. The results show that respondents are concerned about the threat of climate change and participate in the FFF to claim their right to a healthier planet and encourage people to adopt environmentally friendly practices in their lifestyles. Young people feel they are global citizens, connected through the Internet and social media, and show greater sensitivity to the planet's environmental problems, so they are willing to take effective action to demand sustainable policies from decision-makers. When planning public policies that will affect future generations, it is important for policymakers to know the demands and opinions of key stakeholders, especially young people, in order to plan the most appropriate measures, such as climate change mitigation.",1
"As China's economy has transitioned, the energy industry has developed rapidly. The government is promoting a revolution in energy production and consumption and building a green, low-carbon, safe and efficient energy system. The high-quality development of green energy has become an essential part of high-quality economic development. This paper constructs a high-quality green energy development indicator system from three aspects: green energy production, green energy output and pollution output. Then, the entropy weight method is used to measure the high-quality development level of inter-provincial green energy in China from 2010 to 2018. Moreover, the characteristics of regional differences and time evolution are deeply analyzed. Based on this, the impact of sports industry agglomeration on the high-quality development of green energy is verified. The results show that the aggregation of the sports industry can increase the level of high-quality development of green energy, and different regions have heterogeneous characteristics. Finally, based on the research conclusions, this paper puts forward some policy recommendations for promoting high-quality energy development in China.",1
"We explore the implications of an increase in clean technology spillovers between developed and developing countries. We build a game of abatements in which players are linked with technology spillovers determined by an initial choice of absorptive capacities by developing countries. We show that, within a non-cooperative framework, the response of clean technology investments in developed countries to an increase in cross-country technology spillovers is ambiguous. If the marginal benefits of these additional abatements are not sufficiently high, developed countries have a strategic incentive to decrease investments. Such a strategic response jeopardizes the initial effects of an increase in technology spillovers on climate change mitigation and decreases the incentives for developing countries to enhance their absorptive capacities.",1
"The present study investigates the possibility of woodfuels' involvement and its increased participation role in the energy grid of the Thrace prefecture. This issue comes as a response to the imperative legislative and environmental adaptations to EU regulations regarding the gradual independence from fossil fuels in the energy supply, in line to the dominant role of renewables' exploitation in the energy sector at all the European countries. Addressin the involvement of woodfuels in the aforementioned energy sector of the Thrace prefecture is a controversial issue that necessitates a thoughtful balance of the advantageous and disadvantageous socio-environmental conditions that should accomplish a win-to-win situation in a social, political, economical and environmental level of analysis. Finally, the main counterparts of the proposed energy scheme are also addressed. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",1
"With the foregrounding of clean energy policies by climate change concerns, the rhetorical constitution of America as a collective subject, mobilized to adopt the clean energy economy (CEE), becomes crucial. Here, I analyze the constitutive rhetoric of Pew Charitable Trusts' landmark 2009 report on the CEE, drawing from the ventriloqual perspective to communication. I argue that this approach provides a more pragmatic, conversational understanding of the interpellative process constituting America, noting it to be hybridized and composed of various human and nonhuman agents. Tracing the ingoing interaction among agents-some manifest in the text, others spectral-sheds light on the complex relations of power at stake, recognizes the open-ended possibilities (and restrictions) of agency, and the role of material structures shaping environmental communication and policy.",0
"Membrane technology has been extensively studied for CO(2 )capture applications, especially for flue gas sources. In the past decades, facilitated transport membranes (FTMs) have made breakthroughs overcoming the permeance-selectivity trade-off upper bound restricting traditional CO2 separation membranes, but are still facing challenges towards practical applications, including limited performance, such as insufficient CO2/N-2 selectivity to achieve 95 % CO2 dry-base purity by one step separation, and long-term stability. Herein, we designed and fabricated a novel FTM structure containing an ionic liquid (1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium aminoacetate, [Emim][Gly]) as mobile CO2-carrier and a polymeric amine (polyethyleneimine, PEI) as fixed CO2 carrier. The fixed carrier is confined within a carbon nanotube (CNT) framework of 230 nm thickness via electrostatic forces adjusted by a polyelectrolyte (polystyrene sulfonate, PSS), while the mobile carrier diffuses freely within the CNT framework. After optimization of the membrane recipe and spray-coating fabrication procedure, following our previous work, the resulting CNT-PSS-PEI similar to IL membranes demonstrated an ultra-high CO2/N-2 selectivity up to 1,000 with CO2 permeance up to 2,400 GPU (Gas Permeation Unit, 1 GPU = 3.348 x 10(-)(10) mol.s(-1).m(-2).Pa-1) under vacuum operation condition. Furthermore, one 100-cm(2) flat sheet membrane sample was prepared and exhibited one-stage CO2 enrichment from 15 % to 95 % purity (dry-base) for the first time amongst all reported CO2 separation membranes. The membrane retained a stable performance over 50-h operation period under vacuum condition. The extraordinary CO2 separation performance illustrates the great potential of the CNT-PSS-PEI similar to IL membranes for flue gas carbon capture application.",1
"Renewable energy sources (RES) can undoubtedly contribute to protecting the environment and conserving fossil fuels, as well as enhancing regional and rural development opportunities. However, every energy production process affects the environment and involves the use of land resources. The risks linked to intensified RES use should be adequately taken into consideration in any planning process, as ill-conceived energy policies may adversely impact land and local ecosystems, and lead to increases in public spending. Therefore, before designing any instruments for the regulation of both RES and land-use, the most essential step is to explore investment possibilities in different contexts. This paper intends to locate and quantify the potentials of biomass, wind and solar as well as to explore some of the potential planning issues associated with their development. The methods and findings presented in this paper may help to build a vision for the development of an optimal RES portfolio and to highlight emerging problems associated with RES deployment.

The software has been well tested and results are compared to that achieved by similar other licensed software.",1
"Addressing environmental concerns alongside economic development and energy transitions is a challenge for all countries and effective policy making requires approaches that can balance all these concerns. In this paper, combining a range of modeling methodologies is proposed as a way of addressing these questions in an integrated manner. The choice of models to be used would depend on the specific characteristics of the system and region being studied. One possible combination of models is discusses in this paper for the specific case of India. The Integrated Modeling Framework (IMF) proposed combines three modeling approaches - i) index decomposition to estimate impacts of structural changes in the economy, ii) constrained optimization to estimate least cost fuel options for the power sector, iii) input-output analysis to estimate economic impacts. The model results indicate that the mode of investment for climate change mitigation is a significant determinant of the impact on economic growth, incomes, and income distribution in India. In some scenarios, higher investments in green energy negatively affects low income households significantly more as compared to other households. The paper also demonstrates how the IMF can be used to determine the reasons for and therefore alleviate the negative impacts. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",1
"This paper presents an analysis of climate policy instruments for the decarbonisation of the global electricity sector in a non-equilibrium economic and technology diffusion perspective. Energy markets are driven by innovation, path-dependent technology choices and diffusion. However, conventional optimisation models lack detail on these aspects and have limited ability to address the effectiveness of policy interventions because they do not represent decision-making. As a result, known effects of technology lock-ins are liable to be underestimated. In contrast, our approach places investor decision-making at the core of the analysis and investigates how it drives the diffusion of low-carbon technology in a highly disaggregated, hybrid, global macroeconometric model, FIT:Power-E3MG. Ten scenarios to 2050 of the electricity sector in 21 regions exploring combinations of electricity policy instruments are analysed, including their climate impacts. We show that in a diffusion and path-dependent perspective, the impact of combinations of policies does not correspond to the sum of impacts of individual instruments: synergies exist between policy tools. We argue that the carbon price required to break the current fossil technology lock-in can be much lower when combined with other policies, and that a 90% decarbonisation of the electricity sector by 2050 is affordable without early scrapping.

"The Dutch CATO CCS research community has established an implementation plan for CCS in the Netherlands including a CATO CCS roadmap. The roadmap comprises 26 actions which need to be implemented within the next ten years. The actions address five different CCS themes or issues which need to be covered to successfully implement large-scale CCS. The roadmap has been established in close cooperation with main CCS stakeholders. As guidance for the roadmap, a vision on CCS in the Netherlands for 2050 has been developed. The vision depicts the view of the stakeholders on the role of CCS in the energy system. This roadmap can serve as a solid foundation for CCS stakeholders from both industry and government but also from universities and research institutes to define their next activities. The government can make use of it by defining their short and medium-term CCS action plan. The roadmap is presented in an interactive form on a website that allows stakeholders to directly find relevant information on the actions and background information. (C) 2014 The Authors.

"With the transition to renewable energies and, above all, strongly fluctuating electricity from wind and solar energy, there will be a need for energy storage in the future. For central grid-scale storages, underground geological storage, similar to those already used for fossil fuels, is in the first place under review. Compressed Air Energy Storages have already been successfully used to provide minutes to hours reserve. For storage capacities in the day to week range, storage is required on a chemical rather than a mechanical basis, through either the conversion of electricity into pure hydrogen (H-2) or the generation of mixtures of natural gas and synthetic methane. The latter - the so-called power-to-gas option - allows the use of the existing gas infrastructure. A likely first choice for the storage of H-2 or H-2-SNG mixtures are man-made salt caverns. The suitability of porous rock storage (depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs or water-bearing reservoirs - aquifers) is still under investigation. Interest in porous rock storage options arises, inter alia, from the fact that many regions of Europe lack suitable salt deposits. Favorable salt deposits exist in the UK, notably in the Cheshire Basin to the west and in eastern England, with six salt cavern-hosted facilities operated as natural gas storages. In any case, underground gas storages are characterized by high safety and low environmental impact.",1
"Wind power and solar energy are representatives of renewable resources, and their volatility and randomization make power grid regard wind power and solar energy as negative load in daily dispatch. The increase of wind power and solar energy in the system may lead to the increase of uncontrollable factors, so the abilities for power grid to receive wind power and solar energy might be limited. Limiting factors including power grid's peak-load regulation capacity, frequency regulation capacity, wind power and solar energy output characteristics, load characteristics, external transmission channel of power network and so forth, setting up renewable resources index that the power grid can shoulder can reflect the saturation level of power grid, providing reference and evaluation basis for the operation and management of electric system. According to various kinds of factors that may affect power grid's acceptance ability, the index system which can reflect multi-time scale power grid's acceptance ability about renewable resources put forward. The power grid's acceptance ability is evaluated by power grid's short term, mid-term and long term these three time dimensions, and the operation security of the system and the restriction of the economy can also be took into consideration. Through index quantization value the power grid's acceptance ability towards different proportion's renewable resources can be reflected.",1
"In renewable energy systems, the highly intermittent nature of energy sources with the unpredicted nature of load and grid availability make it a great challenge to operate and transition a system seamlessly under large number of modes while still being able to follow the command of the supervisory control. In this work, an advanced control technique is proposed to integrate energy storage elements with intermittent renewable sources that can achieve seamless transitions while implementing the key protections and ability to follow external commands. The proposed control technique is based on instantaneous power balance theory and dynamic power limiter of the energy source, which is implemented in fast local controller and it does not require any exclusive determination of modes. Therefore, under rapid change of source, load, and grid conditions, the proposed system can respond more quickly and make transitions with increased reliability. Furthermore, the conventional techniques for Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) fail to perform efficiently under low insolation level condition and they do not offer accurate yet oscillation free operation at MPP. In this work, an adaptive tolerance band is proposed to achieve highly accurate fluctuation free MPPT under all the operating conditions, and hence, to improve the performance of the integrated system. Simulation and experimental results are presented to validate the proposed techniques.",1
"This study examines the degree of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in the European banking sector in terms of commitment to the 2030 Agenda Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It also explores whether gender diversity on the board of directors can be used to differentiate between companies with different degrees of engagement with the SDGs. This question is important, given that achieving equal opportunities for women is a CSR priority for today's companies given stakeholders' demands. Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses are conducted using a sample of the 30 largest banks in Europe in terms of market capitalization as of 15 February 2019. Key conclusions are that most of the analyzed banks target at least one of the SDGs and that the banks that are most committed to Goals 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) and 13 (Climate Action) of the 2030 Agenda have greater gender diversity on their boards of directors.",1
"This paper proposes for the first time to combine the concept of deep learning to analyze the data under the energyPLAN platform. In the process of data simulation, the Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) algorithm is introduced to compensate for the missing data of individual energy indicators, so as to realize the intelligent monitoring and renewable energy. It is significant for secondary utilization of energy. Regarding innovation of Energy Management Module (EMM) and availability of renewable energy development, we have achieved phased results, but there are still challenges: (1) The feature extraction of the data is broken down or stolen, and the distortion problem occurs. The original data of the training sample is abnormal, and the integrity of the data needs to be expanded; (2) Large-scale data relies solely on simulation. There are still feasibility problems, and further verification is needed. In the article, the real-time power data and simulation collected by the international platform energyPLAN are used to verify the deep learning, and the compensation data is integrated into the verification at the same time.",1
"With large-scale grid-connected renewable energy, new power systems require more flexible and reliable energy storage power sources. Pumped storage stations play an important role in peak shaving, valley filling, and promoting renewable energy consumption. This paper presents the reasonable energy-abandonment operation of a combined power generation system (CPGS), in which a pumped storage station is the core control power, with an ultra-high proportion of renewable energy. Firstly, based on the seasonal characteristics of wind, solar, and load demand, typical days are selected through improved clustering analysis algorithms. Then, a daily optimal scheduling model for combined power generation systems (CPGS) is developed with the goals of economy, low-carbon, and stable operation. Finally, the correlation between the energy-abandonment rate and pumped storage station peak shaving and system optimization operation indicators is obtained by a reasonable energy-abandonment calculation method considering source-grid-load coordination. Taking the operation data of an energy base in the western region of China as an example, when the penetration rate of renewable energy is 60-70% in the future, the operating cost on the power side is greatly affected by the construction of the source side. When the system operates at a planned reasonable energy-abandonment rate of 2%, electricity regulation, load tracking, and daily operating costs all show better performance.",1
"Economies around the globe are pushing toward a society's sustainability perspectives and upgradation in technology to protect the environment from global warming and the depletion of energy supplies. This shift in perception is primarily intended to alter people's attitudes toward posterity. By integrating the theories of interactions between social and ecological systems and the environment Kuznets curve (EKC) framework, this study explores the impact of nonrenewable energy consumption, social sustainability, and technological innovation on CO2 emissions across the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries from 2001 through 2020. Based on the estimates of FMOLS, PARDL, and QARDL, the 10-year CO2 emissions and gross domestic product projections are traced using the average growth rate for each country and an average value of independent variables. The findings of this study highlight the detrimental effect of nonrenewable energy consumption on CO2 emissions, underscoring the urgency for sustainable energy alternatives. However, the positive role of social sustainability and technological innovation in curbing CO2 emissions within OECD countries is equally significant. Accentuating the importance of social sustainability within this context, the study sheds light on the integral role that societal factors, such as education, public awareness, and social well-being, play a substantial role in shaping sustainable practices. It is found that Brazil, China, Malaysia, Russia, South Africa, and Thailand need to focus on higher economic growth to experience decarbonizing economic growth.",1
"Urgent solutions to global climate change are needed. Ambitious tree-planting initiatives, many already underway, aim to sequester enormous quantities of carbon to partly compensate for anthropogenic CO2 emissions, which are a major cause of rising global temperatures. However, tree planting that is poorly planned and executed could actually increase CO2 emissions and have long-term, deleterious impacts on biodiversity, landscapes and livelihoods. Here, we highlight the main environmental risks of large-scale tree planting and propose 10 golden rules, based on some of the most recent ecological research, to implement forest ecosystem restoration that maximizes rates of both carbon sequestration and biodiversity recovery while improving livelihoods. These are as follows: (1) Protect existing forest first; (2) Work together (involving all stakeholders); (3) Aim to maximize biodiversity recovery to meet multiple goals; (4) Select appropriate areas for restoration; (5) Use natural regeneration wherever possible; (6) Select species to maximize biodiversity; (7) Use resilient plant material (with appropriate genetic variability and provenance); (8) Plan ahead for infrastructure, capacity and seed supply; (9) Learn by doing (using an adaptive management approach); and (10) Make it pay (ensuring the economic sustainability of the project). We focus on the design of long-term strategies to tackle the climate and biodiversity crises and support livelihood needs. We emphasize the role of local communities as sources of indigenous knowledge, and the benefits they could derive from successful reforestation that restores ecosystem functioning and delivers a diverse range of forest products and services. While there is no simple and universal recipe for forest restoration, it is crucial to build upon the currently growing public and private interest in this topic, to ensure interventions provide effective, long-term carbon sinks and maximize benefits for biodiversity and people.",1
"Community based approaches are becoming the norm in environmental governance initiatives. One prominent example of this is Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+), a climate change mitigation strategy that aims at reducing carbon emissions caused by deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries. REDD+ policies generally evoke communities as both potential beneficiaries of REDD+ and as agents for its implementation. However, it is unclear what REDD+ policies are really referring to when they talk about communities. Drawing on critical social science literature about the idea of community, this article advances a performative perspective to analyze how communities are articulated in international and national REDD+ policy, and reflects on the potential implications of these articulations. Results reveal that international policy documents, including those of the major non-governmental organizations (NGOs) engaged in REDD+, tend to present an interpretation that corresponds to Agrawal and Gibson's myth of communities as small, localized, and homogenous social units that share social norms. On the other hand, national policy documents reveal enormous variety in the communities that are actually targeted in national REDD+ policies in terms of resources, governance structure, and social cohesion. One conclusion that could be drawn from this is that the dominant uniform interpretation of communities in REDD+ policy, and in much academic and NGO literature, is clearly unrealistic. However, this does not mean that it is inconsequential. We conclude our article by discussing the performative effects of the identified articulations of community.",1
"Renewable energy has become a significant market player after the turn of the millennium. Wind, solar, smart grid and further renewable energy stocks have experienced both serious up and down trends since that time. In this paper, computed the Minimal Spanning Tree (MST) and Sub-Dominant Ultrametric (SDU) for topological properties of what has been driving the price of renewable energy stock markets and sectors. In this regard, the main object is to define the similarity among sectors in financial market, which is statistically a multivariate time series. The principal mathematical tool to do macro analysis is multivariate vector correlation where multi-dimensional data is considered as a complex system. Furthermore, the base approach for filtering the significant information in a financial system is similarity network analysis. In this paper, the behavior of economic sectors of renewable energy played during 30th July 2015 - 1th January 2018 in America. Results of this study found that, solar sector in renewable energy is confirmed as the dominant sector in America during this period. In addition, results demonstrated that, the leader sector is Solar and the central hubs are Canadian Solar Inc. (CSIQ) from Solar and then Pattern Energy Group Inc. (PEGI) from Solar-Wind sectors.",0
"The incorporation of renewable energy sources into the power grid has necessitated the development of sophisticated forecasting models that can effectively handle the inherent fluctuation and uncertainty associated with renewable energy generation. In this study, an adaptive principal component analysis (PCA)-enhanced transformer architecture, hereinafter referred to as PCA-Transformer, is developed to enhance the performance of transformer models in predicting renewable energy output. The proposed model uses PCA to dynamically determine and adapt the transformer architecture and prioritize the most informative features from time series data, thereby improving the model's attention on relevant information and reducing computational burden. This is essential for accurately capturing the intricate temporal patterns and nonlinear relationships that are typical present in renewable energy time series data. The PCA-Transformer enhances the performance of transformer models in sequence-to-sequence predictions by incorporating an adaptive mechanism that customizes their structure based on the best PCA eigenvectors. The architecture adaptively aligns with the underlying patterns in data by adjusting the number of attention heads and critical dimensions within each transformer block. The adaptability of the proposed architecture is crucial for effectively simulating the complex nature of renewable energy generation patterns. The efficiency of the proposed model was evaluated using the Alice Springs Australia DKASC-ASA and EIA Energy datasets. The proposed model has superior forecasting performance than traditional transformer models and cutting-edge renewable energy forecasting methodologies.",0
"Integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) technology is becoming increasingly more competitive among advanced power generation systems suitable for carbon capture. As an emerging technology, many different IGCC process configurations have been heuristically proposed to meet even more aggressive economic and environmental goals. One attractive design combines gasification with a water-gas shift (WGS) reaction system, pressure swing adsorption, and chemical-looping combustion (CLC) for CO2 removal prior to feeding the fuel gas to the combined cycle for power production. The WGS reaction step is required to convert CO to CO2 and the extent of conversion is determined by the degree of carbon capture required in the CLC step. As a first towards optimizing the overall energy efficiency of this IGCC process, we apply heat exchanger network synthesis (HENS) to the WGS reaction system. This particular part of the process was chosen because of its evident integration potential (steam required for the WGS reactions can be generated by recovering energy released by the same reactions) and the influence of some of the gasifier parameters (temperature and pressure) on its performance and on all the subsequent parts of the process. After generating alternative designs using Aspen Energy Analyzer (AEA), the HENS problem was formulated in the sequential-modular Aspen Plus simulator using a process superstructure approach and solved by mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) algorithms. The HENS capability is implemented as CAPE-OPEN (CO) compliant unit operation and makes use of MINLP algorithms, namely Generalized Bender's Decomposition (GBD), Outer Approximation (OA), Equality Relaxation (ER), Augmented Penalty (AP), and Simulated Annealing (SA). This MINLP-based HENS was used in the CO-compliant Aspen Plus simulator to obtain a design for the WGS reaction system that provided a cost of energy for the IGCC system with CO2 capture that was 28% lower than the base case.

"Aim Widespread greening and an increasing global terrestrial carbon sink over recent decades have been reported. However, the spatio-temporal relationships between vegetation greenness and productivity and the factors influencing this relationship remain unclear. We define a new metric of ecosystem-scale photosynthetic efficiency (EPE) to analyse its spatio-temporal pattern and investigate how potential drivers regulate the greenness-productivity relationship. Location Global. Time period From 2001 to 2016. Major taxa studied Global terrestrial ecosystems. Methods This study used global datasets of leaf area index (LAI) and solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) as proxies of vegetation greenness and ecosystem productivity, respectively, to propose a new metric of SIF/LAI, representing ecosystem-scale photosynthetic efficiency (EPE). We identified the spatial pattern and dynamics of EPE and examined factors influencing EPE. Results The results showed a weaker increase in productivity compared with the global greening rate from 2001 to 2016, suggesting a decline in EPE at the global scale. This decline in EPE indicates a disproportionate increase in terrestrial productivity against the widespread greening. When stratified into areas following an aridity gradient, we found that EPE overall showed upward trends in arid and semi-arid areas, and downward trends in dry sub-humid and humid regions. The EPE was controlled primarily by soil moisture, which promoted or constrained the EPE in xeric and mesic ecosystems, respectively. Moreover, the increase in short vegetation cover and atmospheric water demand contributed positively or negatively to EPE changes in xeric and mesic ecosystems, respectively. Main conclusions Our study shows that greening of the Earth is associated with decreasing EPE, revealing that current rates of carbon sequestration do not increase proportionally to greening of the Earth and highlighting that soil moisture is a key controller of EPE. These results help to reduce the uncertainties in future climate change impacts on vegetation dynamics, thus having implications for sustainable ecosystem management and climate change mitigation.",1
"A number of Carbon Capture and Storage projects (CCS) are under way around the world, but the technology's high capital and operational costs act as a disincentive to large-scale deployment. In the case of both oxy-combustion and post-combustion CO2 capture, the CO2 compression and purification units (CO2CPU) are vital, but costly, process elements needed to bring the raw CO2 product to a quality that is adequate for transport and storage. Four variants of the CO2CPU were modelled in Aspen HYSYS each of which provide different CO2 product purities at different capital and operating costs. For each unit, a price of CO2 is calculated by assuming that it is an independent entity in which to invest and the internal rate of return (IRR) must be greater or equal to the minimum rate of return on investment. In this study, we test the hypothesis that, owing to the fact that CO2 will likely be transported in multi-source networks, not all CO2 streams will need to be of high purity, and that it may be possible to combine several sources of varying purity to obtain an end-product that is suitable for storage. We find that, when considering study generated costs for an example network in the UK, optimally combining these different sources into one multi-source transport network subject to a minimum CO2 purity of 96% can reduce the price of captured CO2 by 17%.

"We compare the effectiveness of absolute vs. intensity targets in preparing China for progressively stronger climate action under the Paris Agreement. The Agreement requires countries to submit nationally determined contributions (NDCs) every five years and in addition calls for submission of long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies up to 2050. This study conducts a multi-criteria comparison of the adoption of an absolute vs. an intensity interim target in 2030, followed by an absolute target in 2050, for China. In doing so, we explicitly consider economic growth uncertainty as it is the main motivation behind China's and other developing countries' adoption of intensity targets for 2030. We perform the target comparison analytically, as well as using the stochastic version of a large-scale integrated assessment model. The stochastic model is based on expected utility theory and explicitly accounts for uncertainty. Key policy insights If China wants to hedge against higher than expected economic growth, it is reasonable to adopt an intensity target. However, in the case of lower economic growth, this choice becomes problematic as policy costs will rise while the economy grows slow The difference in costs due to the 2030 target choice can be of the same order of magnitude as the overall climate policy costs themselves An interim absolute target performs better than an equivalent intensity target, under multiple criteria",1
"Large-scale concentrated Variable Renewable Energy (VRE) sources pose a challenge to the balance and security of electricity systems. Studies have shown that the demand side may offer a greater responsiveness based on the shiftability of loads. However, there is currently no known literature on the demand response (DR) of large-scale shiftable loads in the residential sector. Firstly, there is no sufficiently large database of residential appliancelevel load. Secondly, scheduling a large number of small residential shiftable loads simultaneously is a major challenge. Ultimately, the DR of large-scale residential buildings encounters the challenge of ensuring sufficient backup shiftable load to effectively cope with real-time VRE fluctuations during the response period. To address these issues, this paper proposes an appliance-level load data generation method based on diffusion neural networks. Meanwhile, a clustering method based on Generalized End to End (GE2E) loss neural networks is proposed to solve the complexity obstacles in simultaneous load swarm scheduling. Thirdly, a two-stage scheduling approach is proposed to address the challenges in the large-scale DR period through constructing day-ahead and real-time response models. The simulation results show that large-scale residential shiftable loads have a strong response capability to VRE fluctuations, and their response cost is lower than the conventional fuelfired-power-plant-based-response within a certain user preference cost range. In practice, the clustering and scheduling methods proposed in this paper can be applied after the non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) method is deployed to decompose the load data.",1
"The traditional way of designing parameters of university buildings is to give designs based on the experience of designers after surveying the local environment, but this approach is time-consuming and laborious. The research problem of this paper is to quickly optimize the parameters of university buildings with the goal of energy saving. This paper first constructed a model of energy consumption and lighting of university buildings, then used a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm modified by the genetic algorithm to optimize the building parameters, and compared it with the traditional PSO algorithm in a case study. The results were that the PSO algorithm improved by the genetic algorithm converged the building parameter scheme to stability faster, and the scheme fitness value at stability was lower than that of the traditional PSO algorithm, and the improved PSO algorithm required less computation time in optimizing the building parameter scheme.",1
"This paper is a review article collecting relevant data and information for developing a transition model towards a sustainable energy city: a case study of Krabi Province, Thailand An expanding tourism sector in Krabi is increasing energy demand, which continues to grow year after year. Meanwhile, the energy supply of the province relies on the centralization of the southern and central regional energy system to the national grid transmission system. According to the 2018 National Power Development Plan, Krabi is projected to shift to regional grid decentralization; coupled with increasing its power generation from renewable energy with affordability and community participation. Therefore, Krabi Vision 2020, which is a provincial master plan, would lead the direction of Krabi's plan towards energy transition. Increasing renewable energy investment and disruptive technology to secure the potential of solar, biomass, biogas, wind and mini-hydro is paving the way to shift Krabi to a sustainable energy future. The implementation of a sustainable energy transition across the province, would bring benefits for the local economy, environmental conservation, and energy security. To achieve this energy transition, Krabi requires coordination of smart policy, local and government participation, and sound planning This review study suggests that the transition towards a sustainable energy future depends on identifying the political barriers, and the adoption of effective management practices.",1
"In this work, the feasibility of converting existing university buildings to Net Zero Energy Building (NZEB) in presence of Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) is investigated. Three buildings N54 (office), N44 (laboratory) and N24 (residential) are considered as the experimental candidates with different modes of operation and compared to the operating NZEB (N78). The N78 is considered as the baseline model to calculate the energy budget of the candidate buildings. Then, the calculated energy budget of candidate buildings provides the target to be achieved and the design variables to be considered consequently. After the analysis of the integrated performance of the candidate buildings compared to the baseline model (N78), the feasibility of the NZEBs is validated taking into account the energy performance, CO2 emission reduction, and economics of the buildings. The energy budget calculation done for the simulated results illustrates that the addition of the RESs into the operation of the building shows the highest feasibility of conversion to NZEB for building N24 and the lowest feasibility for building N44.",1
"In this paper an approach for analysing the potential for implementation of different technology pathways for the European pulp and paper industry (PPI) is presented. The approach is based on detailed technical research and aggregates the knowledge from previous studies to incorporate the whole European PPI. Thus, the potential for different technology pathways can be estimated on a European level whilst still considering important characteristics of individual mills. The usefulness of the approach was exemplified by applying it to a case study of the potential for introduction of carbon capture and storage (CCS) within the European PPI. The results from the case study show that for the European PM, CCS has an up-hill road in order to be a viable, large scale alternative for reduction of CO2 emissions. If CCS is to be introduced in large scale within the European PPI, large biomass-based point sources of CO2 emissions need to be included when planning for CCS infrastructure and also the infrastructure needs to be built out for clusters emitting <20 MtCO(2)/yr.

"Globally, it is estimated that similar to 1500 Pg C of organic carbon is stored in the top meter of terrestrial soils. This represents the largest terrestrial pool of carbon. Appropriate management of soils, to maintain or increase the soil carbon pool, represents a significant climate change mitigation opportunity. To achieve this, appropriate tools and models are required in order to more accurately estimate soil carbon fluxes with a view to informing and developing more effective land use management strategies. Central to this is the evaluation of models currently in use to estimate soil carbon emissions. In the present study, we evaluate the ECOSSE (Estimating Carbon in Organic Soils - Sequestration and Emissions) model which has its origins in both SUNDIAL and RothC and has been widely used globally to model soil CO2 fluxes across different locations and land-use types on both organic and mineral soils. In contrast to previous studies, the model was found to poorly represent observed soil respiration at the study site, an arable cropland on mineral soil located in south-east Ireland. To isolate potential sources of error, the model was decomposed into its component rate equations or modifiers. This investigation highlighted a deficiency in the model simulated soil water, resulting in significant inhibition of the model simulated CO2 flux relative to the observed data. When measured values of soil water at the site were employed, the model simulated soil respiration improved significantly (r(2) of 0.775 vs 0.154). This highlighted model deficiency remains to be evaluated at other sites; however, the research highlights the need for a more comprehensive evaluation of soil carbon models prior to their use in informing policy, particularly models which are employed at larger scales and for climate change projections.

"The trend for the decarbonization of the transportation sector, contributing to climate change mitigation, has driven the accelerated deployment of electric buses in cities. However, higher upfront costs, charging infrastructure deployment and operational issues are the main obstacles to their massive adoption. This work develops an optimization model to deal with the charging schedule of a fleet of battery electric buses. This approach aims to minimize the charging costs of electric bus fleets also considering the ageing of the batteries and the participation in vehicle to grid schemes. We developed a case study using real-world data from a small electric bus fleet of eleven electric buses in a medium-size Portuguese city. Further, we performed a sensitivity analysis to assess the possibilities of energy trading with the grid. The results indicate that below a battery replacement cost threshold of 100 V/kWh, it may become economically attractive for public transportation operators to sell back energy to the grid for a given remuneration scheme. Considering battery degradation and energy selling, our study indicates that operation costs could be 38% lower in 2030. The approach presented in this article provides a tool that can be employed by public transportation operators to assist decision making in the electrification of bus systems. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

"Soil microenvironments and plant varieties could largely affect rhizosphere microbial community structure and functions. However, their specific effects on the tea rhizosphere microbial community are yet not clear. Beneficial microorganisms are important groups of microbial communities that hold ecological functionalities by playing critical roles in plant disease resistance, and environmental stress tolerance. Longjing43 and Zhongcha108 are two widely planted tea varieties in China. Although Zhongcha108 shows higher disease resistance than Longjing43, the potential role of beneficial tea rhizosphere microbes in disease resistance is largely unknown. In this study, the structure and function of rhizosphere microbial communities of these two tea varieties were compared by using the Illumina MiSeq sequencing (16S rRNA gene and ITS) technologies. Rhizosphere soil was collected from four independent tea gardens distributed at two locations in Hangzhou and Shengzhou cities in eastern China, Longjing43 and Zhongcha108 are planted at both locations in separate gardens. Significant differences in soil physicochemical properties as demonstrated by ANOVA and PCA, and distinct rhizosphere microbial communities by multiple-biotech analyses (PCoA, LEfSe, Co-occurrence network analyses) between both locations and tea varieties (p < 0.01) were found. Functions of bacteria were annotated by the FAPROTAX database, and a higher abundance of Nitrososphaeraceae relating to soil ecological function was found in rhizosphere soil in Hangzhou. LDA effect size showed that the abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) was higher in Zhongcha108 than that in Longjing43. Field experiments further confirmed that the colonization rate of AMF was higher in Zhongcha108. This finding testified that AMF could be the major beneficial tea rhizosphere microbes that potentially function in enhanced disease resistance. Overall, our results confirmed that locations affected the microbial community greater than that of tea varieties, and fungi might be more sensitive to the change in microenvironments. Furthermore, we found several beneficial microorganisms, which are of great significance in improving the ecological environment of tea gardens and the disease resistance of tea plants. These beneficial microbial communities may also help to further reveal the mechanism of disease resistance in tea and potentially be useful for mitigating climate change-associated challenges to tea gardens in the future.",1
"In the past, the only treatment of acute exacerbations of obstructive diseases with hypercapnic respiratory failure refractory to medical treatment was invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). Considerable technical improvements transformed extracorporeal techniques for carbon dioxide removal in an attractive option to avoid worsening respiratory failure and respiratory acidosis, and to potentially prevent or shorten the duration of IMV in patients with exacerbation of COPD and asthma. In this review, we will present a summary of the pathophysiological rationale and evidence of ECCO2R in patients with severe exacerbations of these pathologies.",0
"In this paper a small-signal modeling of the DC-DC boost-buck converter is presented, whose attractive feature is that both input and output currents can be controlled through different duty cycles applied in each leg, which defines the proposed modulation strategy. This switching sequence is composed of three different states, which gives the basics to obtain the equivalent small-signal equations, the equivalent small-signal circuit and the transfer functions of the converter. Simulation results validate the model through time domain responses and frequency domain.",0
"With the rapid depletion of fossil fuels, the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere has significantly increased, exacerbating global environmental challenges such as climate warming and air pollution, which pose threats to the ecosystem and human health. Consequently, effectively controlling atmospheric CO2 concentrations has become a critical issue for global society in this century. Carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) technologies are crucial for mitigating the greenhouse effect. However, the capture is a necessary prerequisite for either the transformation or sequestration of CO2. Nevertheless, the key lies in the efficient capture materials. In this regard, aerogels, with their excellent three-dimensional porous structures, are widely used as carbon capture materials. This paper firstly introduces different types of aerogels. Then, reviews how various modifications and composite techniques affect their CO2 capture performance is reviewed. Furthermore, it analyzes the performance, advantages, and research progress of polymer-based, biomass-based, inorganicbased, and carbon-based aerogels in carbon capture applications. Finally, the application prospects and challenges of aerogel-based materials in carbon capture are discussed in detail. This paper is expected to shed light on the design and development of aerogel-based materials with superior carbon capture performance.",1
"The PROINFA is a Brazilian government policy which is divided into two phases and whose objective is to promote the expansion of power generation through renewable sources. This paper aims to assess the efficiency of the second phase with regard to long-term scenarios (2009-2030), identifying gaps and barriers, and proposing policy options to address them. In the first phase, the Program calls for the generation of 3,300 MW of renewable energy with a national business participation rate of 60%, aiming to maximize the country's regional potentials, create jobs, reduce CO2 emissions through thermal (fossil) displacement, and promote energy contracts with differentiated conditions for conventional sources, as well as specific tariff/MWh for each source. The second phase fixes a 90% nationalization rate and a 15% Brazilian electrical energy annual consumption rate to be supplied by these sources. The goals of this phase are expected to be reached within twenty years, and the price will be a weighted average between competitive hydroelectric and thermoelectric (natural gas) prices.",1
"In an attempt to anticipate possible futures of drylands of West Africa in the face of rapid socio-economic and environmental changes, we developed four scenarios based on recent survey data, the literature and our knowledge of the region. The four scenarios are inspired by those developed by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment: (1) 'downward spiral' characterized by rapid climate change, expansion of agriculture and chaotic urban growth; (2) 'integrated economy' with integrated land management, food production for local markets and rural-urban exchanges; (3) 'open doors' characterized by large-scale out-migrations, land grabbing by foreign companies and development aid and (4) 'climate change mitigation' with an increase in biofuel crops, land management for carbon capture and development of off-farm activities. We conclude that the Sahel region is most likely moving away from being a highly climate-dependent region based on agriculture towards a more open and diversified economy. West African countries have to find a balance between the new opportunities and risks created by economic globalization.",1
"Peatlands play a key role in the circulation of the main greenhouse gases (GHG) - methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), and nitrous oxide (N2O). Therefore, detecting the spatial pattern of GHG sinks and sources in peatlands is pivotal for guiding effective climate change mitigation in the land use sector. While geospatial environmental data, which provide detailed spatial information on ecosystems and land use, offer valuable insights into GHG sinks and sources, the potential of directly using remote sensing data from satellites remains largely unexplored. We predicted the spatial distribution of three major GHGs (CH4, CO2, and N2O) sinks and sources across Finland. Utilizing 143 field measurements, we compared the predictive capacity of three different data sets with MaxEnt machine-learning modeling: (1) geospatial environmental data including climate, topography and habitat variables, (2) remote sensing data (Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2), and (3) a combination of both. The combined dataset yielded the highest accuracy with an average test area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.845 and AUC stability of 0.928. A slightly lower accuracy was achieved using only geospatial environmental data (test AUC 0.810, stability AUC 0.924). In contrast, using only remote sensing data resulted in reduced predictive accuracy (test AUC 0.763, stability AUC 0.927). Our results suggest that (1) reliable estimates of GHG sinks and sources cannot be produced with remote sensing data only and (2) integrating multiple data sources is recommended to achieve accurate and realistic predictions of GHG spatial patterns. We compared remote sensing and geospatial data to predict peatland greenhouse gas sinks and sources across Finland. Remote sensing data perform less effectively than habitat and climate-related variables. We recommend integrating various data sources for modeling greenhouse gas sinks and sources.",1
"Significant quantities of water are utilized in thermoelectric power plants, mostly for the purpose of cooling. Water is becoming critically important for low carbon power generation. To reduce greenhouse gas emissions from pulverized coal (PC) power plants, post-combustion carbon capture systems are receiving considerable attention. However, current systems require a significant amount of cooling, which puts further pressure on cooling water resource. This paper quantifies cooling water use and evaluates technical and economic effects of carbon capture on cooling systems at PC power plants. Included are recirculating systems with wet cooling towers and air-cooled condensers (ACCs) for dry cooling. For a wet cooling tower, water has to be provided to make up losses due mainly to evaporation and blowdown. Adding an amine-based carbon capture system to the plant would approximately double water use. When air-cooled condensers (ACCs) are used as the dry cooling system, in spite of the advantage in reducing water usage, the dry cooling system has a much larger capital cost than the wet cooling system, depending strongly on specific site and system characteristics.

"This article argues that in order to achieve climate justice, recognition needs to be given more attention in climate research, discourse, and policies. Through the analysis of three examples, we identify formal and discursive recognition as central types of recognition in climate issues, and we show how powerful actors exercise their power in ways that cause climate injustice through formal and discursive misrecognition of poor and vulnerable groups. The three examples discussed are: climate mitigation through forest conservation (REDD), the Great Green Wall project in the Sahel, and the narrative about climate change as a contributing factor to the Syrian war.",0
"The energy transition is a global imperative to shift from fossil fuels to sustainable and renewable energy sources, mitigating climate change and ensuring a sustainable future. One promising technology that has the potential to accelerate this transition is 3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing.

"Entrepreneurship serves as a driving force for the advancement of renewable energy. Entrepreneurs are often at the forefront of innovation, bringing new technologies and business models to the clean energy sector. This study conducts a comprehensive examination of the intricate relationship between entrepreneurship and renewable energy production in 23 developed countries throughout the period from 2000 to 2020. For this purpose, the impact of 11 sub-index of entrepreneurship on renewable energy production has been estimated. The method is dynamic panel data with the system GMM (Generalized Method of Moments) technique. After estimating 11 entrepreneurship sub-indices effects separately on renewable energy production, the impact of each is ranked. The findings showed that the impact rank of 11 sub-indexes of entrepreneurship on renewable energy production is as follows: Commercial and professional infrastructure (CP), R&D transfer (RD), Physical and services infrastructure (PS), Governmental support and policies (GS), Taxes and bureaucracy (TB), Governmental programs (GP), Internal market openness (MO), Internal market dynamics (MD), Post-school entrepreneurial education and training (PE), Basic school entrepreneurial education and training (BE), and Cultural and social norms (CS). The importance of Commercial and professional infrastructure (CP) as an entrepreneurship sub-indices is 2 times more than R&D transfer (RD), so Commercial and professional infrastructure is vital for the development of entrepreneurship that affects the production of renewable energies. This study not only underscores the central role of entrepreneurship in driving the adoption of renewable energy but also provides essential insights into key policy measures to accelerate the transition to sustainable energy sources. It highlights the urgency of addressing environmental challenges and emphasizes the imperative for collaboration among governments, NGOs, and educational institutions to achieve these critical goals.",1
"Purpose This study aimed to compare the clinical outcomes and differences in biomechanical characteristics between the femoral neck system (FNS) and cannulated cancellous screws (CCSs) in the treatment of femoral neck fractures. Methods This study retrospectively analysed a cohort of 38 registered cases of femoral neck fractures treated surgically with either the FNS (n = 17) or CCSs (n = 21) between January 2020 and December 2023. Indicators such as fluoroscopy frequency, length of hospital stay, and fracture healing time were compared between the two groups. Functional status was evaluated via the Harris hip score (HHS) and visual analogue scale (VAS), whereas prognosis was assessed based on changes in the neck shaft angle and femoral neck shortening. Additionally, six sets of femoral neck fracture models were developed based on Pauwels angles of 30 degrees, 40 degrees, 50 degrees, 60 degrees, 70 degrees, and 80 degrees. Two experimental groups, FNS and CCS, were established, and a joint reaction force of 1800 N was applied to the proximal femur. The displacement, stress, and stiffness of the components of interest in the different models were tested and compared. Results The distributions of all the baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups (p > 0.05). The FNS group presented significantly shorter fluoroscopy frequency, length of hospital stay, and fracture healing time (p < 0.05). Harris and VAS scores were higher in the FNS group than in the CCS group (p < 0.05). Postoperative changes in the neck shaft angle and femoral neck shortening were significantly lower in the FNS group than in the CCS group (p < 0.05). The results of the finite element analysis indicated that the maximum stress on the femoral head and varus angle were generally lower in the FNS group than in the CCS group and that the maximum displacement of the femoral head and FNS was generally lower in the FNS group than in the CCS group. However, the superiority of FNS over CCS decreased with increasing Pauwels angle. Additionally, the effectiveness of FNS in limiting displacement of the femoral neck upper wall was not as favourable as that of CCS. Conclusions The treatment of femoral neck fractures with FNS is superior and contributes to improved hip joint function. Biomechanical research has confirmed its structural stability and advantages in resisting femoral head varus. However, challenges to its fixation efficacy persist, particularly at higher Pauwels angles.",0
"The concept of combining bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) has been identified as one mechanism to achieve energy production with a net negative atmospheric carbon emission. Conventional geological carbon capture and storage involves large capital outlay and recurring expense. Therefore there is increased interest in coupling biological carbon capture and sequestration with biomass production. Systems such as low-input high-diversity native grasslands and biochar production have been heralded as carbon negative biofuels. Another potential production system for bioenergy with biological carbon capture and storage (BEBCCS) is the large-scale cultivation of seaweed (macroalgae) for biofuels. Marine biofuels offer considerable advantages over terrestrial first-generation biofuels in terms of their low land use, fresh water and fertilizer requirements. In addition, they also offer considerable potential in the field of BEBCCS. Macroalgae rapidly accumulate biomass and as part of this process, a significant proportion (estimates range up to 60%) of the carbon they fix photosynthetically is released into the water. A proportion of this released dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is highly labile and enters the bacterial loop and is rapidly remineralized back to CO2. However, a proportion is known to be resistant to biological degradation and enters the refractory DOC pool. The marine DOC pool is the largest organic carbon pool on the planet and the refractory component is known to have a turnover period of 100s-1000s years. The release of refractory DOC from macroalgae combined with biofuel production offers the potential for large scale carbon negative fuel production.

"This article is focused on issues concerning electric vehicle technology, linked to the use of renewable sources and their incorporation into the concept of modern automated (unattended) traffic systems - ATS. This concept creates an ideal environment for the generation and development of so-called Smart Grids. Deployment of electric vehicles (herein abbreviated to EV) and automated traffic systems in the Smart Grids will enormously reduce the costs and accelerate the massive and large-scale onset of electric mobility, which will in turn result in the dramatically increased stability of electricity grids, as well as a revaluation of the hitherto known renewable energy sources which will not be restricted by the limited capacity of the present distribution networks. The interconnection of technologies will result in a complete solution to the use of renewable energy sources as the most lucrative energy source for automotive transport with a new revolutionary perspective on issues concerning the stability of energy and distribution networks, and their transformation into Smart Grids.",1
"While renewable energy technologies (RET) increase their share in power generation systems worldwide, some questions remain open, namely those concerning the opinion of the populations on new projects of these technologies. Given the long period of planning and large capital sums required by RET and, in some cases, the fact of being subsidized, it is desirable for decision-makers to acknowledge the public opinion and at least perceive if the opinions are rooted on biased perceptions. In this paper we propose a methodology for public perception and awareness assessment, involving an initial phase of data collection by means of a survey, followed by a phase of regression models construction resulting in predictive models of expected perceptions and attitudes towards RET. The models were translated in a free and easy to use computational Excel application and its usefulness was demonstrated for the case of four electricity RET in Portugal: hydro, wind, biomass and solar.

"Pyrogenic carbon (C) is produced by incomplete combustion of fuels including organic matter (OM). Certain ranges in the combustion continuum are termed 'black carbon' (BC). Because of its assumed persistence, surface soils in large parts of the world contain BC with up to 80% of surface soil organic C (SOC) stocks and up to 32% of subsoil SOC in agricultural soils consisting of BC. High SOC stocks and high levels of soil fertility in some ancient soils containing charcoal (e. g., terra preta de Indio) have recently been used as strategies for soil applications of biochar, an engineered BC material similar to charcoal but with the purposeful use as a soil conditioner (1) to mitigate increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2) by SOC sequestration and (2) to enhance soil fertility. However, effects of biochar on soils and crop productivity cannot be generalized as they are biochar-, plant-and site-specific. For example, the largest potential increases in crop yields were reported in areas with highly weathered soils, such as those characterizing much of the humid tropics. Soils of high inherent fertility, characterizing much of the world's important agricultural areas, appear to be less likely to benefit from biochar. It has been hypothesized that both liming and aggregating/moistening effects of biochar improved crop productivity. Meta-analyses of biochar effects on SOC sequestration have not yet been reported. To effectively mitigate climate change by SOC sequestration, a net removal of C and storage in soil relative to atmospheric CO 2 must occur and persist for several hundred years to a few millennia. At deeper soil depths, SOC is characterized by long turnover times, enhanced stabilization, and less vulnerability to loss by decomposition and erosion. In fact, some studies have reported preferential long-term accumulation of BC at deeper depths. Thus, it is hypothesized that surface applied biochar-C (1) must be translocated to subsoil layers and (2) result in deepening of SOC distribution for a notable contribution to climate change mitigation. Detailed studies are needed to understand how surface-applied biochar can move to deeper soil depths, and how its application affects organic C input to deeper soil depths. Based on this knowledge, biochar systems for climate change mitigation through SOC sequestration can be designed. It is critically important to identify mechanisms underlying the sometimes observed negative effects of biochar application on biomass, yield and SOC as biochar may persist in soils for long periods of time as well as the impacts on downstream environments and the net climate impact when biochar particles become airborne.",1
"Ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE) is a negative emissions technology (NET) that shows significant potential for climate change mitigation. By increasing the bicarbonate ion concentration in ocean water, OAE could enhance long-term carbon storage and mitigate ocean acidification. However, the side effects and/or potential co-benefits of OAE on natural planktonic communities remain poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, a mesocosm experiment was conducted in the oligotrophic waters of Gran Canaria. A CO2-equilibrated total alkalinity (TA) gradient was employed in increments of 300 mu mol L-1 , ranging from similar to 2400 to similar to 4800 mu mol L-1. This study represents the first attempt to evaluate the potential impacts of OAE on planktonic communities under natural conditions. The results show that net community production (NCP), gross production (GP), community respiration (CR) rates, and the metabolic balance ( GP : CR ) did not exhibit a linear response to the whole alkalinity gradient. Instead, significant polynomial and linear regression models were observed for all rates up to Delta TA 1800 mu mol L-1, in relation to the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentrations. Notably, the Delta TA 1500 and 1800 mu mol L-1 treatments showed peaks in NCP shifting from a heterotrophic to an autotrophic state, with NCP values of 4 and 8 mu mol O-2 kg(-1) d(-1) , respectively. These peaks and the optimum curve were also reflected in the nanoplankton abundance, size-fractionated chlorophyll a , and C-14 uptake data. Furthermore, abiotic precipitation occurred in the highest treatment after day 21, but no impact on the measured parameters was detected. Overall, a damaging effect of CO2- equilibrated OAE in the range applied here on phytoplankton primary production, community metabolism, and composition could not be inferred. In fact, a potential co-benefit to OAE was observed in the form of the positive curvilinear response to the DIC gradient up to the Delta TA 1800 treatment. Further experimental research at this scale is key to gain a better understanding of the short- and long-term effects of OAE on planktonic communities.",1
An Energy Management System (EMS) to balance the production of renewable sources with the consumption by a set of electrolization units is proposed here based on Model Predictive Control ideas (MPC). This EMS regulates the operating point of each electrolyzer and its connections or disconnections using a Mixed-Integer-Quadratic-Programming algorithm. A case study is given for an installation composed of wave and wind energy sources and a set of 3 alkaline electrolyzers. Validation using measured data at the target location of the installation shows the adequate performance of the proposed EMS.,0
"China's rapid economic development is unavoidably characterized by environmental pitfalls, especially the carbon dioxide emissions of greenhouse gases from the use of energy. Since there is a relationship between economic growth, energy consumption, and carbon emission, it is important to note that the continuous improvement and application of solar energy technology will play an active role in carbon emission reduction. Therefore, this paper uses the Kuznets curve to probe the relationship between economic growth, solar energy technology, and carbon emissions. The results show that solar energy technology, economic development level, and carbon emissions are all integrated at the second order with a long-run cointegration relationship. In the long-run, the relationship between economic growth and carbon emissions is inverted U, which suggest that there is a turning point of carbon emissions, where the carbon emissions first increase with economic growth and then gradually decrease, which is reflected in the image as an inverted U curve. Also, the impact of economic factors on carbon emissions and the innovation of solar technology can negatively influence carbon emissions, and enhancing the innovation of solar technology has a positive effect on reducing carbon dioxide emissions.",1
"Coal fly ash accumulation, global warming, and heavy metal-contaminated water environments are three primary environmental concerns. Porous geopolymers are economical porous adsorbents that can be produced using coal fly ash as a raw material and employed for heavy metal removal from water. However, residual alkalis on the geopolymer can lead to extreme increases in pH and cause environmental stresses, which limits the large-scale production and application of geopolymers in industries and environments. A green approach to alleviating the high basicity of geopolymers through CO2 exposure is proposed, with CO2 adsorption experiments as well as Zn removal batch and column experiments conducted to evaluate the practicality of the synergistic strategy. CO2 adsorption experiments show the CO2 capture capacity of fresh geopolymer (F@PG) is 0.80 mmol g(-1) , greater than that of the conventionally washed geopolymer (W@PG, 0.26 mmol g(2)), with the pH of the geopolymer decreasing after both washing and CO2 exposure. Batch experiments suggest neither washing nor CO2 exposure cause a significant change in the Zn adsorption capacity of the geopolymer; column experiments show the CO2- exposed geopolymer (C@PG) has a pH < 9.5 and a satisfactory Zn removal performance similar to W@PG, but F@PG with a pH similar to 12 results in a conversion of Zn to anionic forms and a decrease in Zn removal efficiency. These results indicate CO2 exposure is a practical method to decrease the pH of geopolymers for applications related to heavy metal-contaminated water treatment and provide a large-scale industrial option for coal fly ash consumption and CO(2)emission reduction.",1

"The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) calls for the maritime industry to restrict its CO2 emissions by -40% (IMO2030) and -70% (IMO2050). This paper answered the following research question: Which technical, economic and emissions-related conditions predominantly determine the feasibility of a conceptual supply chain of liquid CO2 that is captured from the exhaust gases of LNG powered offshore vessels? The captured CO2 is transported to land where it is utilized by a final customer. The study followed a systems engineering approach. Problem definition was followed by a requirements analysis (technology, emissions, economy and operations), design with scenarios and a case study with realistic vessel deployment, modeling and evaluation. All designs have technical uncertainties and financial risks, but the sale of captured CO2 could be a crucial advantage of the proposed concept over other concepts. The main conclusion is that emission and financial targets (payback time) can be met by aligning the offshore transportation distance with the capacity to store CO2 on board and the available means of transport to the final user. Specialists from the vessel owner indicate that capturing, storage and off-loading is likely to have minor implications for the vessel availability and regular operations.",1
"This paper presents a methodology to select the most exciting business models based on renewable energy and circular economy technologies within end-of-life coal mines to help develop a renewable-based energy sector, promote sustainable local economic growth, and maximise the number of green and quality jobs. To achieve this goal, first, a structural analysis was developed to select the technical variables that better identify this complex system. Second, a morphological analysis allowed the construction of the scenario space. Third, a multicriteria assessment was developed to achieve this goal, based on the previously assessed relevant scenarios, considering the European Green Deal policies, technical variables that characterise end-of-life coal mine environments, technology readiness level, the European taxonomy, synergistic potentials, contributions to the circular economy, and sector coupling. Finally, result indicators were selected to analyse the alternative options derived from the justification approach, considering the targets set by the European Green Deal and related taxonomy and the regional policy indicators for the Just Transition Fund. The results show that eco-industrial parks with virtual power plants represent the most appropriate business model choice, according to the scoring given to the different aspects. They may be complemented by a hydrogen production plant, provided that specific economic subventions are obtained to achieve balanced financial results.",1
"As Climate Change starts to show substantial impact on viticulture, winemakers are under pressure to implement sustainability transformation to maintain future production. This article deals with the effects of agroforestry system use on wine production and marketing in the German Mosel Region and reviews its challenges and benefits regarding sustainability transformation. The study is based upon qualitative interviews and field visits, researching farmers' experiences with an agroforestry vineyard in the cool climate wine growing region and reviewing the production methods on-site. Applying Sustainability Levers Theory, the article shows that the use of agroforestry in viticulture targets deep leverage points of the food production system, enabling sustainability transformation by providing positive effects on production and marketing. The article thus concludes that there's a potential of mitigating challenges of climate change, sustaining the wine production due to the implementation of agroforestry.",1
"This paper presents a literature review addressing the public acceptance of renewable energy as a replacement for fossil fuels in electricity production. This review was motivated by the global tendency for a substitution of conventional fuels by renewable energy sources (RES) during the global financial crisis. It studies research on the preferences and attitudes of local communities towards investments in renewable energy projects and their perception of the use of new energy technologies in their daily lives, through various case studies worldwide. An effort is made to identify the parameters that influence consumers' energy behaviour, together with their interest, or lack thereof, in the environmental impact of using fossil fuels to produce energy and their willingness to reduce it. Applications of contingent valuation are examined, which are employed to analyse public attitudes towards the use of RES for electricity production. Willingness-to-pay is observed to be correlated to socioeconomic characteristics including education, interest in environmental issues and knowledge of RES. Finally, the profile of a typical green energy consumer and appropriate policy paths for the penetration of RES into the energy market are outlined. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
"Carbon emission reduction is crucial for mitigating global climate change, and green fiscal policies, through providing economic incentives and reallocating resources, are key means to achieve carbon reduction targets. This paper uses data covering 248 cities from 2003 to 2019 and applies a multi-period difference-in-differences model (DID) to thoroughly assess the impact of energy conservation and emission reduction (ECER) fiscal policies on enhancing carbon emission (CE1) reduction and carbon efficiency (CE2). It further analyzes the mediating role of Green Innovation (GI), exploring how it strengthens the impact of ECER policies. We find that: (1) ECER policies significantly promote the improvement of carbon reduction and CE2, a conclusion that remains robust after excluding the impacts of concurrent policy influences, sample selection biases, outliers, and other random factors. (2) ECER policies enhance CE1 reduction and CE2 in pilot cities by promoting green innovation, and this conclusion is confirmed by Sobel Z tests. (3) The effects of ECER policies on CE1 reduction and the improvement of CE2 are more pronounced in higher-level cities, the eastern regions and non-resource cities. This research provides policy makers with suggestions, highlighting that incentivizing green innovation through green fiscal policies is an effective path to achieving carbon reduction goals.",1
"The emergence of algal biorefineries has garnered considerable attention to researchers owing to their potential to ensure carbon neutrality via mitigation of atmospheric greenhouse gases. Algae-derived biofuels, characterized by their carbon-neutral nature, stand poised to play a pivotal role in advancing sustainable development initiatives aimed at enhancing environmental and societal well-being. In this context, algae-based wastewater treatment systems are greatly appreciated for their efficacy in nutrient removal and simultaneous bioenergy generation. These systems leverage the growth of algae species on wastewater nutrients-including carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus-alongside carbon dioxide, thus facilitating a multifaceted approach to pollution remediation. This review seeks to delve into the realization of carbon neutrality through algae-mediated wastewater treatment approaches. Through a comprehensive analysis, this review scrutinizes the trajectory of algae-based wastewater treatment via bibliometric analysis. It subsequently examines the case studies and empirical insights pertaining to algae cultivation, treatment performance analysis, cost and life cycle analyses, and the implementation of optimization methodologies rooted in artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms for algae-based wastewater treatment systems. By synthesizing these diverse perspectives, this study aims to offer valuable insights for the development of future engineering applications predicated on an in-depth understanding of carbon neutrality within the framework of circular economy paradigms.",1
"Belite-calcium sulfoaluminate (BCSA) clinkers are usually obtained at temperatures lower than 1350 degrees C by burning a raw meal composed of limestone, clay, natural gypsum and bauxite. The use of limestone quarry waste, dredged sediments, water potabilization sludge and flue gas desulfurization gypsum as complete substitutes for natural raw materials was investigated. Two BCSA clinkers based on natural raw materials and on waste materials, respectively, were synthesized in a laboratory electric furnace. Two BCSA cements were prepared by blending the clinkers with natural anhydrite at the same calcium sulfate / ye'elimite ratio, and their hydration behaviour was investigated. The BCSA cement made from the waste materials showed a faster early reaction than the one prepared from natural raw materials. At later ages, both cements developed a similar hydrate assemblage, consisting mainly of ettringite, AFm-phases and str & auml;tlingite. Also the physical properties, i.e. compressive strength, porosity and volume stability, are rather similar, with the exception that late compressive strength (after 56 days) is significantly higher for the cement made from waste materials. The results show that it is possible to manufacture BCSA clinkers entirely from local waste materials.",1
"This article examines China's Electric Power Law and the recent policies governing China's electricity sector from the energy-climate-environment dimension. Using the fragmented authoritarianism framework, it captures the legal system that is still rooted in the pre-reform era, and the antinomic policy making that is driven by the policy imperative to accommodate the shifting pattern of energy supply, the growing awareness over climate mitigation and environmental protection. By examining the most recent policy imperatives on regulating new investment and efficiency, and pricing deregulation, this article focuses on changes in the policy arena and their impacts on the regulatory governance of China's electricity sector. Using the methodology of qualitative study, this article critically investigates these policy changes that generate incompatible regulatory concerns. The incompatibility creates competing regulatory concerns over energy-climate-environment in the policy making process, and generates discord between China's central and provincial governments. Dealing with the challenges will depend on developing a legal framework for China's electricity sector. Findings of this article echoes with energy law scholars' point of view that energy law has a much bigger role to play to balance different or competing policy agendas to deliver better energy policy that delivers the expected outcomes for society.",1
"Recent studies have shown that fossil generators equipped with post-combustion carbon capture (PCC) systems are needed to reduce the cost of deep decarbonization. Such generators need to be flexible and responsive to grid conditions, particularly in a high variable renewable energy (VRE) environment. In this work, we evaluate the net present value (NPV) of retrofitting an existing natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) unit with a flexible PCC system while incorporating market signals from a high VRE grid. We use our industrial partner's NGCC configuration as representative of existing NGCC units and Svante's rapid-temperature swing adsorption (TSA) for PCC. Because of its ability to rapidly startup/shutdown and ramp-up/ramp-down, the chosen capture technology is very attractive for load-following operations. For a given set of market signals, we formulate a two-stage stochastic multi-period optimization problem, under the price-taker assumption, to simultaneously optimize the design of the capture system and operation of the entire plant. Rigorous models for the NGCC unit, PCC system, and compression system are developed using commercial process simulators and validated with either plant or vendor data. For computational tractability, we develop surrogate/reduced-order models for use in the optimization problem. The surrogate model for the NGCC plant is constructed by linearizing the rigorous dynamic model at 75% load, while data-driven nonlinear surrogate models for the capture and compression systems are constructed using simulation data from the rigorous models. The optimization problem, formulated as a mixed integer bilinear program, is implemented in the IDAES (R) integrated platform and solved to global optimality using Gurobi 9.5. Using this formulation, we determine the profitability of retrofitting an existing NGCC unit with the chosen capture system for multiple regions in the U.S. under two scenarios with different carbon prices. The results show that the optimal decision strongly depends on the region and on the carbon price, thereby demonstrating the importance of the inclusion of market signals in the design process.",1
"For the first time we used lab and wind-wave tank experiments to prove the concept of using Mg(OH)(2) for the ocean alkalinity enhancement and carbon dioxide removal approach (OAE-CDR). Experiment results showed up to 370 mu mol kg(-1) seawater total alkalinity (TA) increase without precipitation, stable enhanced TA, and OAECDR efficiency (Delta DIC/Delta TA) consistent with theoretical calculation. Based on the experimental results, we calculated the global Mg(OH)(2) OAE-CDR efficiency and CO2 sink from this approach. The efficiency is in favor of lower initial DIC to TA ratio, lower temperature, and higher atmospheric CO2, and therefore is the lowest at the equator (0.7-0.8) and increases with latitude (1.0-1.2 above 70 N/S). However, factoring in the ocean's surface area, low latitude regions can absorb more atmospheric CO2. We conservatively estimate that 44. 4 x 109 ton of CO2 (similar to 3.3 times of current annual CO2 sink in the ocean) could be removed from the atmosphere with 175 mu mol kg(-1) Mg(OH)(2) (equivalent to 350 mu mol kg(-1) of TA) added to the top 10 m of the ocean.",1
"A novel high step-up dc-dc converter with a coupled inductor and a switched capacitor is proposed in this paper, which is widely used in the renewable energy system as the front-end stage for low voltage sources. The combinational employment of the switched capacitor and the coupled inductor makes high voltage gain achievable without extreme duty cycle, resulting in reduced voltage stress on power switches. Hence, MOSFETs with low resistance R-DS(ON) could be utilized as the main switch to reduce conduction loss. Meanwhile, due to the leakage inductance of the coupled inductor, the current falling rate becomes controllable, and the reverse-recovery problem of the output diode is alleviated. Importantly, by incorporating an active clamped-circuit, not only are voltage spikes caused by leakage inductance restrained, but also zero-voltage switching could be obtained for the main and auxiliary switches. Specially, the clamped circuit plays a role of energy transfer to boost the gain as well. Finally, a prototype with a power rating of 500 W is implemented to verify the performance of the proposed converter.",1
"The challenge of climate mitigation is made more difficult by high rates of energy use in wealthy countries, mostly in the Global North, which far exceed what is required to meet human needs. In contrast, more than 3 billion people in poorer countries live in energy poverty. A just transition requires energy convergence-reducing energy use in wealthy countries to achieve rapid emissions reductions, and ensuring sufficient energy for development in the rest of the world. However, existing climate mitigation scenarios reviewed by The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change do not explore such a transition. On average, existing scenarios maintain the Global North's energy privilege at a per capita level 2.3 times higher than in the Global South. Even the more equitable scenarios perpetuate large energy inequalities for the rest of the century. To reconcile the Global North's high energy use with the Paris Agreement targets, most scenarios rely heavily on bioenergy-based negative emissions technologies. This approach is risky, but it is also unjust. These scenarios tend to appropriate land in the Global South to maintain, and further increase, the Global North's energy privilege. There is an urgent need to develop scenarios that represent convergence to levels of energy that are sufficient for human wellbeing and compatible with rapid decarbonisation.",1
"In this paper we propose a dynamic model representing the temporal evolution of the levels of power generation (installed capacity) from two competing sources. These are renewable and conventional ( fossil) sources. The percentage penetration rates of renewable and nonrenewable sources are considered as control or decision variables. We introduce an objective functional based on energy demand, production of pollution associated with usage of fossil fuels, and the cost of their systematic substitution by renewable sources. Pontryagin minimum principle is used to determine optimal control policy through minimizing energy generation from fossil fuels while meeting the energy demand as closely as possible through gradual replacement of nonrenewable sources by renewable ones. For different choices of plan periods, optimal generation path along with the corresponding control policies are presented. These results demonstrate that modern control theory can be used effectively to formulate optimal socio-economic policies. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",1
"Croatia aims to achieve 10% of its energy production from the renewable energy sources in the total energy consumption in the transport sector. One of the ways to achieve this goal is by the use of electric vehicles. This work comparatively analyses the financial and social aspects of vehicle-to-grid charging in standard and fast charging mode, their impact on the renewable electricity production and the total electricity consumption regulated through variable electricity prices. Data were taken for the wider urban area of the Dubrovnik region. The assumption is that the Dubrovnik region will be self-sufficient by the year 2050 with 100% renewable electricity production and that all conventional vehicles will be replaced by electric vehicles. This work aims to show that the fast charging based on 10 min time steps offers more opportunities for flexibility and utilization of renewable generation in the energy system than the standard charging based on hourly time step. The results of this work showed the opposite, where in most of the scenarios standard charging provided better results. Replacement of the existing two tariff model in electricity prices with variable electricity prices contributes to the stability of the energy system, providing better regulation of charging and higher opportunities for renewable electricity utilization in standard and fast charging and reduction of charging costs. According to the financial aspects, fast charging is shown to be more expensive, but for the social aspects, it provides electric vehicles with more opportunities for better competition in the market.",1
"The transition to low carbon energy systems cannot solely rely on technological innovation. It also requires social innovation. In the context of energy transition social innovation can be defined as innovation that is social in its means and which contributes to low carbon energy transition, civic empowerment and social goals pertaining to the general wellbeing of communities. This article presents the editorial comment of the special issue Social Innovation and the Energy Transition. It seeks to answer the questions, what does social innovation mean in the face of energy transition, and what are its implications? This special issue yields 20 article contributions by authors from different academic disciplines within the behavioral and social sciences. From these contributions, key topics relevant to social innovation emerge, pertaining to: (i) technological innovation leading to new market models, actor configurations, and institutional settings creating room for social innovation; (ii) new governance arrangements; (iii) community energy, its impact, implications, and social incentives and policy to empower it; (iv) new participative research approaches to test and learn from livings labs and best practices; (v) 'green nudges' to stimulate behavioral change; and (vi), serious energy games. The editorial ends with suggestions for future research.",1
"The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of the Korean government's sustainable energy policy providing solar photovoltaic (PV) systems for low-income households living in public rental apartments in metropolitan Seoul. To assess the solar PV system's effectiveness as a government-initiated tool to provide the energy poor with reliable, affordable energy, the present study sought different kinds of information: government energy policy analyses through published reports, and surveys and focus group interviews of tenants, installers, and public officials. Results show the government's efforts switching from fossil fuels to renewable energies for CO2 savings, part of which was to support low-income households with solar panels on verandas. Electricity bill reduction and government funding for the system were found to be the most important motivations for installing solar PVs in their houses. The tenants showed overall satisfaction with their PV systems including its installation process, their participation in the government sustainable energy policy, and the design and quality of solar PV generators. However, their satisfaction level had dropped regarding the system's capacity and actual energy bill reductions. Future studies are recommended on larger samples over long term perspectives, ongoing post-installation education and energy consumption feedback, and smart technologies added to PV systems including smart grids, meters, sensors as performance checkers and enhancers.",1
"Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is broadly recognised as having the potential to play a key role in meeting climate change targets, delivering low carbon heat and power, decarbonising industry and, more recently, its ability to facilitate the net removal of CO2 from the atmosphere. However, despite this broad consensus and its technical maturity, CCS has not yet been deployed on a scale commensurate with the ambitions articulated a decade ago. Thus, in this paper we review the current state-of-the-art of CO2 capture, transport, utilisation and storage from a multi-scale perspective, moving from the global to molecular scales. In light of the COP21 commitments to limit warming to less than 2 degrees C, we extend the remit of this study to include the key negative emissions technologies (NETs) of bioenergy with CCS (BECCS), and direct air capture (DAC). Cognisant of the non-technical barriers to deploying CCS, we reflect on recent experience from the UK's CCS commercialisation programme and consider the commercial and political barriers to the large-scale deployment of CCS. In all areas, we focus on identifying and clearly articulating the key research challenges that could usefully be addressed in the coming decade.",1
"Advanced biofuels produced from lignocellulosic crops grown on marginal lands can become an important part of the European Union (EU) climate change mitigation strategy to reduce CO2 emissions and meet biofuel demand. This study quantifies spatially explicit the availability of marginal land in the EU, its production biomass potentials for eight different crops, and the greenhouse gas (GHG) performance of advanced biofuel supply chains. Available land is mapped based on land marginality and Renewable Energy Directive Recast (REDII) land-related sustainability criteria. Biomass potentials are assessed with a water-use-to-biomass-production approach while considering the available land, location-specific biophysical conditions and crop-specific phenological characteristics. The GHG balance of advanced biofuels from energy crops produced on marginal lands is assessed considering both land-related carbon stock changes and supply chain emissions with the carbon footprint approach from the REDII. Available marginal land that meets REDII criteria is projected at 20.5-21 Mha 2030 and 2050, respectively. Due to biophysical limitations, not all available land is suitable for energy crop production. The maximum biomass potential of lignocellulosic energy crops (optimal crop choice with maximum yield for each available location) varies between 1951 PJ year(-1) in 2030 and 2265 PJ year(-1) in 2050. The GHG emission performance (net emissions) of different advanced biofuel supply chains varies on average between -32 g CO2-eq MJ(fuel)(-1) for poplar/willow diesel to 38 g CO2-eq MJfuel-1 for reed canary grass renewable jet fuel. The large variability in GHG performance is strongly determined by the spatial heterogeneity, which dictates the type of feedstock produced under specific local biophysical conditions, the crop characteristics, and the best conversion pathway. Negative GHG emissions are related to increased carbon stocks for the biomass and soil organic carbon pools compared to the land prior to conversion. When for each location, the advanced biofuel supply chain with the highest GHG performance (lowest net GHG emissions) is selected, 618 PJ year(-1) of advanced biofuels can be produced by 2030. Under REDII GHG emission criteria, slightly less (552 PJ year(-1)) is viable. Smart choices on location, crop type and supply chain design are paramount to achieve maximum benefits of bioenergy systems.",1
"Among the background of rapid urbanization and climate change, the capacity of urban ecosystems to recover from disturbances has been considerably disrupted. However, the existing study often lacks dynamic assessments in terms of the response process underlying ecological resilience. Here we use the resistance, adaptability, and recovery framework to quantify the ecological resilience, and the dynamic response of ecological resilience to carbon storage and emissions was investigated. The results showed that (a) the ecological resilience of Dalian demonstrated a trend of continuous decline from 2005 to 2019; (b) the clustering characteristics of cold/hot spots for ecological resilience in Dalian were obvious. The cold spots of ecological resilience agglomerated into larger cold spots area during the study. The new patches were mainly located in the southern of Jinzhou and the downtown area of Dalian; (c) carbon storage had a clear positive impact on urban ecological resilience, and this impact showed an increasing trend. In contrast, carbon emissions had a clear negative impact on urban ecological resilience. The piecewise linear regression results reveal that the impact of carbon emission on ecological resilience had a threshold effect, and the area above the threshold became the key area for ecological resilience management; (d) according to the development trend and response conclusion of ecological resilience, the study area was divided into areas of low ecological resilience emission reduction, high ecological resilience carbon storage, and ecological resilience stability protection zone. The present study provides spatial guidance for investigating the evolution and response process of ecological resilience.",0
"This study examines the effects of income inequality and innovation on environmental quality, conditional on the level of each factor. We apply system generalized method of moments to a panel dataset of 91 countries from 1971 to 2015. The estimation results consistently reveal that although income inequality and innovation significantly contribute to better environmental quality, the effect of one factor largely depends on the evolution of the other. Specifically, the beneficial impact of income equality on environmental quality can only be achieved at a high level of innovation. In the same way, innovation is only an effective tool for a nation to reduce environmental degradation when income is fairly distributed among its citizens. This means that more equitable income distribution and higher innovative capacities are two interrelated prerequisites that must both be in place for a country to actualize their beneficial environmental impacts. Overall, our findings shed new light on the relationship between income inequality, innovation, and environmental quality, and they provide relevant implications for policymakers with regard to tackling the dual tasks of reducing inequality and pollution.",1
"Improving the control of flexible assets in distribution grids, e.g., battery storages, electric vehicle charging points, and heat pumps, can balance power peaks caused by high renewable power generation or load to prevent overloading the grid infrastructure. Renewable energy communities, introduced as part of the recast of the Renewable Energy Directive, provide a regulatory framework for this. As a multi-site energy management method, they can tap flexibility potential. The present work quantifies stimulus for renewable energy communities to incentivize the grid-friendly operation of flexible assets, depending on the shares of participants in rural, suburban, and urban grid topologies. Results indicate that an operation of the community, driven by maximizing the economic benefits of its members, does not clearly reduce the annual peak load at the low-voltage substation, while the operation strategy of a grid-friendly renewable energy community achieves a peak power reduction of 23-55%. When there is not full participation, forecasts of the residual load of non-participants provided by the distribution system operator can be considered in the optimization of the renewable energy community. For all simulation cases, the economic benefit between the two operation strategies differs by less than one percent, resulting in a very low additional incentive required for grid-friendliness in terms of reduced peak power. Thus, grid-friendly renewable energy communities might be a cost-effective way to defer future grid reinforcements.",1
"This paper investigates the role of export quality in climate action goal of the sustainable development goals in emerging Asian countries. For this purpose, the empirical model that observes the impact of real GDP, energy use and export quality index on carbon emissions is constructed and is analyzed by ARDL bounds testing approach for the period from 1970 to 2014. We also include the square of real GDP as independent variable to observe the existence of environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis which implies the parabolic relationship between economic growth and environmental degradation. The findings show that increase in export quality leads to a fall in CO2 emissions for China and India. In contrast, the effect of increasing export quality increases CO2 emissions in Thailand and the Philippines. Lastly, our asymmetric causality results show that the positive shocks of export quality causes positive shocks of CO2 emissions in Thailand and Indonesia. Furthermore, we found that positive export quality shocks cause negative CO2 emissions shocks in India while negative export quality shocks cause positive CO2 emissions shocks in China. We also confirm the inverted U-shaped EKC hypothesis in China and Thailand.",1
"Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage (CCUS) is a technology highlighted as one of the tools in climate change mitigation and one of the ways to reach the goal of 1.5celcius set by the Paris Agreement. The European Commission (EC) developed this goal by creating and implementing the European Green Deal (EGD) - the European Union's (EU) environmental policy. This paper provides an analysis of environmental policies and an overview of crucial CCUS projects of selected member states based on a benchmarking analysis of 27+ UK member states. An overall review of a total of 28 countries was undertaken based on economic and environmental factors. Afterward, a benchmarking analysis was performed ranking the countries according to the TOP10 for the selected five categories: total net emissions with international transport, percentage share of the energy sector, percentage share of fossil fuels, percentage share of fossil fuels in the Gross Electricity Production (GEP), and numbers of CCUS projects. Subsequently, a detailed and comprehensive overview of four selected member states was done, with a special focus on the national energy policy towards net-zero emission goals, the role of CCUS in domestic environmental policy, with current projects and facilities development. Finally, this paper outlines how the EGD has reformed the national energy policies of selected member states, and what is the part of CCUS technology in the national efforts towards climate neutrality.",1
"A methodology to determine and preserve Existence of Equilibrium Point (EoEP) is proposed for a power grid dominated by Renewable Energy Sources (RESs). Starting from phasor-domain circuit analysis, a sufficient criterion of assessment in determining EoEP is derived with the theorem of implicit function and analytic continuation. As an outcome of assessment, an indicator, namely the Generalized Short Circuit Ratio (gSCR) is applied to indicate the risk of loss-of-equilibrium for a multi-bus system. Based on gSCR, a decentralized control strategy to prevent loss-of-equilibrium against excessive under-voltage is proposed accordingly. The effectiveness of proposed methodology is verified in case studies with pseudo-steady state simulation, static Monte Carlo method and dynamic EMT simulations.",1
"The environmental pollution and diminishing conventional fuel sources and global warming problems make it more attractive for considering renewables as alternative energy sources, such as solar, wind and micro hydro, etc. Recent advances in hydrogen and fuel cell technologies further facilitate these energy options to supply electrical power to various communities. Hydrogen fuel cell systems coupled with renewable energy sources stand out as a promising solution. This paper presents an integrated system framework for fuel cell-based distributed energy applications. Five components are included in this framework: a physical energy system application, a virtual simulation model, a distributed coordination and control, a human system interface and a database. The integrated system framework provides a means to optimize system design, evaluate its performance and balance supplies and demands in a hydrogen assisted renewable energy application. It can either be applied to a distributed energy node that fulfills a local energy demand or to an energy-network that coordinates distributed energy nodes in a region, such as a hydrogen highway. The proposed system framework has been applied in the first phase of our multi-phases project to investigate and analyze the feasibility and suitability of hydrogen fuel assisted renewable power for a remote community. Through integration with an available renewable energy profile database, the developed system efficiently assists in selecting, integrating, and evaluating different system configurations and various operational scenarios at the application site. The simulation results provide a solid basis for the next phase of our demonstration projects. Crown Copyright (c) 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",1
"The present study examines the significance and magnitude of trends in the monthly rainfall, monthly mean maximum and minimum daily temperatures and streamflow in the Upper Cauvery Basin, Karnataka for a 30-year period, i.e. 1981-2010. Using observed data from 33 rain gauges, 6 climate stations and 4 stream gauging sites, statistical parameters -coefficient of variation (CV) and percentage departure have been calculated for average monthly values separately for three decades. As expected, CV of rainfall showed large variations from December to March, while the percentage departure also varies during these months for different decades. Statistically significant trend was observed in maximum temperature for Chikmagalur and Hassan stations. CV of minimum daily temperature showed large variability from November to March for all climate stations and also a significant increasing trend for Hassan and Bengaluru stations, while for Madikeri a decreasing trend was observed with a variation of -0.16 degrees C/year. Not much variation was found for streamflow, except in K. M. Vadi and T. Narasipur gauge sites, which showed significant decreasing trend of -0.778 m(3)/s/year. Long-range dependence analysis revealed a weak persistence for both rainfall and streamflow of the basin. Results provide information regarding historical climate trends in the Upper Cauvery Basin, which can form the basis for projecting likely future trends and preparing plans for climate change mitigation and adaptation.",0
"Land surface temperature (LST), which is heavily influenced by urban surface structures, is a significant parameter in urban environmental analysis. This study examined the effect impervious surfaces (IS) spatial patterns have on LST in Beijing, China. A classification and regression tree model (CART) was adopted to estimate IS as a continuous variable using Landsat images from two seasons combined with QuickBird. LST was retrieved from the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) image to examine the relationships between IS and LST. The results revealed that CART was capable of consistently predicting LST with acceptable accuracy (correlation coefficient of 0.94 and the average error of 8.59%). Spatial patterns of IS exhibited changing gradients across the various urban-rural transects, with LST values showing a concentric shape that increased as you moved from the outskirts towards the downtown areas. Transect analysis also indicated that the changes in both IS and LST patterns were similar at various resolution levels, which suggests a distinct linear relationship between them. Results of correlation analysis further showed that IS tended to be positively correlated with LST, and that the correlation coefficients increased from 0.807 to 0.925 with increases in IS pixel size. The findings identified in this study provide a theoretical basis for improving urban planning efforts to lessen urban temperatures and thus dampen urban heat island effects.",1
"This is a commentary on the paper in GCB by Moinet et al. (2023) entitled Carbon for soils, not soils for carbon. The paper challenges two claims often made for soil carbon sequestration: (1) Sequestration of C in agricultural soils can make a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation. (2) Increasing SOC will routinely lead to increased crop yields and contribute to global food security.",1
"Municipalities in developing countries can contribute to mitigating climate change and thereby benefit from reductions in the emissions of conventional pollutants and traffic jams or from improvements in waste management systems, amongst other local benefits. These benefits result from measures taken to reduce greenhouse gases emissions (or carbon sequestration) by two means: either measures taken to mitigate greenhouse gases emissions themselves and/or from the income obtained in the international carbon market. The evaluation of the current status of emissions and the potential for mitigation measures are based on various planning techniques, such as inventories and scenario building, as suggested in the paper. A brief report of the experience in making an inventory from secondary data and building up scenarios that has been undertaken in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, is presented as a case study. Mitigation measures that are beneficial to the quality of city environments and suited to municipal administrations are also presented. (C) 2007 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",1
"In this paper, an effective frequency control strategy is proposed for emulating sufficient inertia power and improving frequency stability. The developed technique is based on applying virtual inertia control (VIC) with superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) instead of a traditional energy storage system (ESS) to compensate for the system inertia during the high penetration of renewable energy sources, taking into account the role of the controller in the secondary control loop (SCL). Unlike previous studies that depended on the designer experience in selecting the parameters of the inertia gain or the parameters of the SMES technology, the parameters of the proposed strategy are selected using optimization techniques. Moreover, an improved optimization algorithm called Improved Social Network Search algorithm (ISNS) is proposed to select the optimal parameters of the proposed control strategy. Moreover, the ISNS is improved to overcome the demerits of the traditional SNS algorithm, such as low speed convergence and global search capability. Accordingly, the ISNS algorithm is applied to a hybrid two-area power grid to determine the optimal parameters of the proposed control technique as follows: the proportional-integral derivative (PID) controller in the SCL. Additionally, the ISNS is applied to select the optimal control gains of the VIC-based SMES technology (e.g., the inertia gain, the proportional gain of the SMES, and the negative feedback gain of the SMES). Furthermore, the effectiveness of the proposed ISNS algorithm is validated by comparing its performance with that of the traditional SNS algorithm and other well-known algorithms (i.e., PSO, TSA, GWO, and WHO) considering different standard benchmark functions. Formerly, the effectiveness of the proposed frequency control technique was confirmed by comparing its performance with the system performance based on optimal VIC with ESS as well as without VIC considering different operating situations. The simulation results demonstrated the superiority of the proposed technique over other considered techniques, especially during high penetration of renewable power and lack of system inertia. As a result, the proposed technique is credible for modern power systems that take into account RESs.",1
"In Japan, the National Intended Determined Contributions (INDCs) towards post-2020 GHG emission reductions indicates a reduction of 26.0% is expected by the fiscal year 2030. However, regional emissions allowances have not been fully discussed based on Japan's INDCs target, which considers the regional socio-economic features. Given this, this study points out a soft-path for a fair and efficient quota allocation by proposing an integrated bilevel equilibrium model within a hierarchical structure consisting of the national government and 47 prefectural governments. This proposed model can be changed into a single level solvable equilibrium model, which can be solved by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method. The major findings show that Hokkaido, Tokyo and Osaka were allowed the largest emissions quotas, while Tottori, Saga and Okinawa had the lowest emissions quotas. And the equity is necessary to be considered along with improving the emissions efficiency when reallocating carbon emission quotas, otherwise, the initiative to reduce emissions will not take place in prefectures with higher efficiency performance. Based on the findings, energy policy implications can be generated based on the above quantitative analysis to form a fair and efficient emission quota system at a sub-national level.",1
"Natural gas has been considered as the best transition fuel into the future carbon constraint world. The ever-increasing demand for natural gas has prompted expanding research and development activities worldwide for exploring methane hydrates as a future energy resource. With its vast global resource volume (similar to 3000 trillion cubic meter CH4) and high energy storage capacity (170 CH4 v/v methane hydrate), recovering energy from naturally-occurring methane hydrate has attracted both academic and industry interests to demonstrate the technical feasibility and economic viability. In this review paper, we highlight the recent advances in fundamental researches, seminal discoveries and implications from ongoing drilling programs and field production tests, the impending knowledge gaps and the future perspectives of recovering energy from methane hydrates. We further emphasize the current scientific, technological and economic challenges in realizing long-term commercial gas production from methane hydrate reservoir. The continuous growth of the corresponding experimental studies in China should target these specific challenges to narrow the knowledge gaps between laboratory-scale investigations and reservoir-scale applications. Furthermore, we briefly discuss both the environmental and geomechanical issues related to exploiting methane hydrate as the future energy resource and believe that they should be of paramount importance in the future development of novel gas production technologies.

"There is much optimism that the 2015 Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention will yield an agreement on mitigation of climate change, to become effective in 2020. In this context, Bahrain represents a developing country with insufficient data to assess mitigation opportunities: its per capita carbon emissions rank among the world's highest, yet there has been no research on the reduction potential of its rapidly growing transport sector. We examine this reduction potential and the costs of various mitigation measures and, further, explore barriers and the view of policymakers and experts. Potential benefits of combined mitigation scenarios are also identified based on their acceptability. We adopt a modified participatory method to develop the scenarios, using the long-range energy alternative planning (LEAP) modelling system, and find that an integrated policy approach can deliver a 23 % reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, costing 108 United States dollars per avoided metric tonne, with politically acceptable scenarios. Better performance, however, would require less acceptable approaches. These findings are significant for decision-making in Bahrain and other Gulf Cooperation Council countries; national target preparation and the setting of fuel economy standards should be begun promptly. We offer lessons to other developing countries on the timely regulation of technical specifications and numbers of passenger vehicles. Participatory approaches to the assessment of mitigation measures can advance environmentally effective, economically feasible and politically acceptable scenarios. The global community can use these results to provide necessary technical and financial assistance to developing countries.",1
"Energy transition requires action from different levels of government. While the national and local level have received ample scholarly attention, thus far little attention has been paid to the regional level. This is remarkable because policy makers across Europe are wondering what governance of regional transition actually is and how to shape and implement it. In the present paper, this concern is addressed. The research questions are, What does regional governance of energy transition entail? How can it be conceptualized? And what does it mean in practice? The questions are answered by presenting the results of a multi-disciplinary literature study, presenting a conceptual framework on governance of regional energy transition, using insights from innovation and transition studies as well as from the regional and network governance literature, and applying this to the illustrative case of the West-Brabant region in The Netherlands. West-Brabant is a relatively large region and was home to a pilot that involved the development of a regional energy strategy. Data collection involved twenty expert interviews, text documents and participative observation in workshops. Results highlight the relevance of each of the key elements of the conceptual governance framework. However, some are particularly relevant like structural characteristics of the regional actor network, actor characteristics, and regional governance arrangements used. The results reveal commonalities with regional governance in other policy domains. This paper contributes to the literature on polycentric governance of energy transition and climate change mitigation, and concludes with the presentation of a research agenda.",1
"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change uses an average global temperature in its analysis of a warming Earth - yet in reality the world has many widely different regional environments. This paper proposes that the Koppen-Geiger regional zoning system would be a practical basis for civil engineers to progress towards net zero greenhouse gas emissions. The effect of climate change on the profession is discussed along with reducing the emissions of construction materials, such as by using more wood and other organic materials. The impact on civil engineering design is considered with reference to water resources projects, plus how this needs to be included in teaching.",1
"The intensification of climate change impacts requires a fast and efficient transition of energy systems and deployment of renewable energies worldwide. An adequate site assessment strategy forms the basis for expanding installed capacities and energy yield. This study applies a set of meaningful criteria to determine site suitability for Germany's onshore wind and utility-scale solar photovoltaics facilities. An aggregated priority index involving meteorological-technical, economic, and environmental criteria is developed and used in a new concept for identifying renewable energy priority zones, where installations of wind and solar energy facilities should be prioritized. As a novelty, this resource-centered approach does not only analyze the mean energy potential as a meteorological criterion but also accounts for other characteristics such as variability, complementarity, and predictability. The results indicate that reducing legal restrictions substantially facilitates wind and solar energy capacity expansion in prioritized zones. With weak restrictions, up to 22% and 12% of Germany represent priority zones for an efficient and sustainable use of solar and wind energy. However, due to the intermittent nature of wind and solar resources, mismatches between generation potential and electricity demand would persist even with substantial capacity expansion. Future energy systems must advance the expansion of renewable energy capacities just as the flexibilization of demand or an increase of storage capacities to guarantee future energy security and mitigate climate change. The newly developed renewable energy priority zones are a starting point and can be transferred to other study areas by specifically adapting criteria and their weighting.",1
"U.S. states have led the federal government in instituting policies aimed at promoting renewable energy. Nearly all research on renewable portfolio standards (RPSs) has treated RPS adoption as a binary choice. Given the substantial variation in the renewable energy goals established by RPSs, we propose a new measure of RPS ambition that accounts for the amount of additional renewable energy production needed to reach the RPS goal and the number of years allotted to reach the standard. By measuring RPS policy with more precision, our analysis demonstrates that many factors found to affect whether a state will adopt an RPS do not exert a similar effect on the policy's ambitiousness. Most notably, our analysis demonstrates that Democratic control of the state legislature is the most consequential factor in determining the ambitiousness of state RPS policies.",1
"This paper addresses the analytical modeling of multiport flyback converters, which are governed by linear differential-algebraic equations. The modeling of these converters poses a challenge due to the switching between multiple such equations that govern the circuit's behavior. The study emphasizes the importance of robust control strategies for addressing the non-idealities in flyback converters. Using MATLAB/Simulink, a dynamic model of the converter is developed. A comparison is made between a Lyapunov function-based controller, a linear proportional integrator controller, and an integral sliding mode controller. The controller consists of two main parts: a duty-ratio feedforward control unit for steady-state parameters and a Lyapunov function-based feedback control unit to handle disturbances. The feedforward control signal helps reduce the workload on the Lyapunov feedback controller. This control system ensures global exponential stability of the closed-loop system, enabling a swift transient response even under line and load disturbances. Mathematical simulations demonstrate its superior performance and stability, while experimental validations are conducted considering equivalent series resistances of each component. The proposed model and control scheme are further validated through a hardware prototype tested under various load and line disturbances. This research highlights the necessity of stress testing and performance evaluation for ensuring smooth and efficient operation of controlled multiport flyback converters across diverse conditions.",0
"In order to further strengthen the heavy metal pollution prevention and control work, specification development of Zhangjiajie Nickel-Molybdenum iron industry, the largest Nickel-Molybdenum ore of Hunan province, Cili county as the study area, to yield maximum Nickel-Molybdenum industry development, has developed a modeling heavy metals' emission reduction in Nickel-Molybdenum ore nesting zone in Cili county, Hunan province, including factors such as the different production methods of Nickel-Molybdenum (mining, mineral smelting) and production yield, processing efficiency of pollutant emissions and pollutants processing equipment, for more than ten enterprises within the jurisdiction of the regulation requirements, to achieve the emission reduction of heavy metal pollutants, to ensure the discharging standard.",0
"Purpose - The primary purpose of this study is to verify whether the target set out by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) for reducing carbon emissions from ships can be achieved by quantitatively analyzing the trends in technological advances of fuel oil consumption in the container shipping market. To achieve this purpose, several scenarios are designed considering various options such as eco-friendly fuels, low-speed operation, and the growth in ship size. Design/methodology - The vessel size and speed used in prior studies are utilized to estimate the fuel oil consumption of container ships and the pace of technological progress and Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) regulations are added. A database of 5,260 container ships, as of 2019, is used for multiple linear regression and quantile regression analyses. Findings - The fuel oil consumption of vessels is predominantly affected by their speed, followed by their size, and the annual technological progress is estimated to be 0.57%. As the quantile increases, the influence of ship size and pace of technological progress increases, while the influence of speed and coefficient of EEDI variables decreases. Originality/value - The conservative estimation of carbon emission drawn by a quantitative analysis of the technological progress concerning the fuel efficiency of container vessels shows that it is not possible to achieve IMO targets. Therefore, innovative efforts beyond the current scope of technological progress are required.",1
"Clathrate-hydrate-based CO2 capture from a post-combustion N-2 + CO2 gas mixture has been experimentally investigated for decarbonization. In this study, we performed hydrate-based continuous CO2 separation experiments for N-2 + CO2 + tetrahydropyran (THP) + water system. The experimental conditions were set at 280.1 K under 3.0 MPa with THP mass fractions w(THP) of 0.22 and 0.11. For each experimental run, the time-dependent changes in compositions in the gas phase and the hydrate slurry were recorded hourly until the system reached a steady state. The cage occupancies of N-2 and CO2 in the structure II 5(12) small cages were determined to be 43 and 24%, respectively, with the powder X-ray diffraction analysis. The obtained results showed that the continuous carbon capture is a practicable scheme, yet the CO2 concentration rate and CO2 recovery ratio are comparable to or lower than those of the pre-combustion systems reported in previous studies. Still, our investigation revealed that the development of an efficient hydrate formation method, such as the improvement of the geometry of mixing impellers, could enhance the CO2 recovery ratio for the continuous operation.",1
"Energy security management remains a complex and fragmented interplay between the population growth, urbanization, economical development and the living environment. Today, green technology application has been the prime contributor and an indispensable factor to preserve the long term reliability of energy supply. This agenda has called for an integrated, adaptive, coordinated, environmentally-oriented and participatory approach to the protection of renewable resources. Malaysia, endowed with its rich natural resources and diversity recognizes the need to adopt a sound developmental framework to transform the country's energy management landscape into a high quality and excellent level. Parallel to this development, both government and non-governmental organizations continue to advocate national efforts to explore alternative energy, and improve the dynamic energy growth in a cost-effective manner. The plan espouses the establishment of ocean energy, geothermal power, hydropower, wind power, hydrogen fuel cell, nuclear energy, biodiesel and bioethanol processing industries. The impetus is accompanied by the integration of environmental protection rules and boosted by the implementation of new energy policies. The present work attempts to address the opportunities, dynamic pressure, and coping strategies of energy security, and green energy development in Malaysia. The present and future outlooks of renewable and non-renewable energy are elucidated. Besides, the research breakthroughs and joint co-operations for the promotion of green energy management are outlined. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",1
"Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) can be an effective and efficient means of mitigating climate change. However, the perceived equity in the distribution of financial incentives for REDD could also emerge as a critical issue in international negotiations. The design of reference levels, which provide the benchmark for crediting emissions reductions, affects the economic incentives for national participation in a REDD mechanism and thus the overall willingness to reach an agreement on REDD. This paper compares the equity impacts of five proposed reference level designs using a partial-equilibrium model. Tradeoffs among equity, environmental effectiveness and cost-efficiency indicate the proposals trigger similar aggregate emissions reductions but lead to different outcomes in efficiency and alternative measures of equity. If equity across countries is measured as the financial incentive provided relative to a country's forest carbon stock, then a REDD mechanism compensating a uniform share of at-risk carbon stocks is the most equitable. On the other hand, if equity is evaluated as the financial incentive relative to the opportunity costs of participating in REDD, then the most equitable approach would be compensating emissions reductions but withholding a part of the payments to compensate for carbon stocks, which also encourages broader country participation under our model.

"Integrated assessment models are extensively used in the analysis of climate change mitigation and are informing national decision makers as well as contribute to international scientific assessments. This paper conducts a comprehensive review of techno-economic assumptions in the electricity sector among fifteen different global and national integrated assessment models. Particular focus is given to six major economies in the world: Brazil, China, the EU, India, Japan and the US. The comparison reveals that techno-economic characteristics are quite different across integrated assessment models, both for the base year and future years. It is, however, important to recognize that techno-economic assessments from the literature exhibit an equally large range of parameters as the integrated assessment models reviewed. Beyond numerical differences, the representation of technologies also differs among models, which needs to be taken into account when comparing numerical parameters. While desirable, it seems difficult to fully harmonize techno-economic parameters across a broader range of models due to structural differences in the representation of technology. Therefore, making techno-economic parameters available in the future, together with of the technology representation as well as the exact definitions of the parameters should become the standard approach as it allows an open discussion of appropriate assumptions.

"The utilization of membrane technology in post-combustion applications is hindered by low CO2 feed partial pressure in the flue gas stream. In order to meet the separation targets of 90% CO2 recovery, 95% or higher CO2 purity, and a Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) increase of less than 35%, Membrane Technology and Research, Inc. (MTR) (Merkel et al., 2010) has proposed the use of the boiler air feed as a sweep stream to increase the CO2 concentration in the flue gas and partial pressure driving force for permeation without additional compression or vacuum. Such a design significantly reduces capture cost but leads to a detrimental reduction in the O-2 concentration of the feed air to the boiler. The transport properties and operating pressures of the membrane stages are optimized in this study. Membrane CO2/N-2 selectivity is varied over a broad range encompassing the values considered by MTR. Membrane CO2 permeability is varied with selectivity according to the variation anticipated by the upper bound of the Robeson plot for CO2 and N-2. Membrane CO2 permeance is calculated assuming membranes can be fabricated with an effective thickness of 0.1 mu m. Additionally, the two stages may utilize different membrane materials. The feed and permeate pressures also are varied over ranges encompassing the values proposed by MTR. The optimization space of membrane properties and operating conditions is scanned globally to determine the process design that minimizes LCOE. The O-2 concentration to the boiler is evaluated during the optimization process and can be used to constrain viable alternatives. The results indicate a fairly broad range of membrane properties can yield comparable LCOE near the minimum. The optimal operating pressure range is somewhat narrower. The minimum allowable O-2 concentration constrains viable designs significantly and is critical to process economics.",1
"The continuous innovation of information and communication technology (ICT) provides new opportunities for the synergistic development of shared prosperity, energy-saving, and emission-reduction. Based on Chinese provincial data from 2000 to 2019, we analyzed the impact of income inequality on energy consumption and carbon emissions from both theoretical and empirical perspectives, focusing on the impact mechanism, moderating effect, and threshold effect of ICT capital on the relationship between income inequality and energy consumption and carbon emissions. The study finds that income inequality increases energy consumption and carbon emissions, whereas regardless of whether it is hardware, software, or communication capital, ICT capital effectively mitigates the growth of energy consumption and carbon emissions caused by income inequality, with a significant inhibitory effect. Furthermore, ICT capital has a stronger moderating effect on energy consumption and carbon emissions in urban and developed eastern region. Notably, the effect of income inequality on the growth of energy consumption and carbon emissions diminishes non-linearly with increasing ICT capital. This study confirms that an increase in ICT capital contributes to the win-win-win situation of shared prosperity, energy-saving, and emission-reduction, providing useful empirical guidance for China and similar countries to fully utilize ICT capital in the digital economy.",1
"Background Fighting the climate crisis is the greatest challenge of our time and will touch all aspects of people's lives. In this context, the United Nations (UN) have called on the sport sector to reduce its negative impacts on the environment and show 'climate leadership'. While some efforts have already been made with regards to mega sport events, there is still a dearth of approaches on limiting the climate impact of recreational sport and exercise programmes. Methods Based on the UN-Framework 'Sports for Climate Action', literature reviews and additional desk research, a checklist to support local level stakeholders in providing climate-friendly sport and exercise programmes was developed. Results The proposed checklist consists of five dimensions that need to be considered when designing and offering a climate-friendly sport and exercise programme: (i) active transport to exercise programmes, (ii) the carbon footprint of different types of exercises, (iii) low carbon sport clothing and equipment, (iv) instructors as champions for climate action and (v) advertising and communication. These five dimensions result in a 16-item checklist that supports the planning, advertising, implementation and evaluation of climate-friendly sport and exercise programmes. Conclusions The proposed checklist intends to facilitate the development of climate-friendly sport and exercise programmes. However, additional work is needed to test the implementation of the checklist at the local level. While the sport sector can make its own contributions to reduce its climate impact, intersectoral action is needed to improve infrastructure for active transport and to build sustainable sport facilities.",1
"The 2030 Agenda was promulgated for the Sustainable Develop Goals (SDGs), which consist of 17 goals created to eradicate poverty and realize a more sustainable world. Among the goals, soil science can contribute significantly toward achieving zero hunger (#2), implementing climate action (#13), bettering life on land (#15), among others. Paddy fields are important sustainable agro-ecosystems for rice (Oryza sativa) production, and rice is the staple food for more than 2 billion people worldwide. Paddy rice is produced mainly in East, South, and Southeast Asia, in region with a monsoon climate. Paddy soils are unique, as they are mostly managed under waterlogged conditions during the rice-growing season. Nitrogen (N) is one of the most important nutrients for many crops, including rice. Some potential sustainable soil management methods are suggested to meet the SDGs, especially in paddy fields and wetlands in East, South, and Southeast Asia, based on current achievements, including N mineralization analysis, soil microbial analysis, and greenhouse gas measurements, to predict soil fertility and effective environmental management practices in the future. One such example of sustainable soil management practice is the amendment of silicate fertilizer produced from steel-making sludge that reduced methane emission from paddy fields (3%-50%) and increased the rice yield in Vietnam.",1
"In the context of low-carbon economy, in order to explore the impact of the fairness concern and reference low-carbon effect on supply chain members' balanced emission reduction decisions and profits, supply chain joint emission reduction dynamic optimization models under four different scenarios are built, in which the manufacturer's optimal emission reduction strategy, the retailer's optimal low-carbon promotion strategy and other equilibrium solutions are solved by differential game theory. On the basis of analysis, a contract is designed to achieve the coordination of the supply chain when members are fairness concern. Some findings are as follows. First, when consumers' purchasing behavior is significantly affected by the reference low-carbon effect, and they have higher expectations for the product's emission reduction level, consumers' reference low-carbon effect will discourage the manufacturer's enthusiasm to reduce emissions, and do harm to the profits of the manufacturer and the retailer. Second, the fairness concern behavior of both parties will aggravate the adverse effects of reference low-carbon effect, bring a detrimental effect on the performance of the supply chain, aggravate the double marginal effect of the supply chain, and cause continuous negative social influence. Third, the bilateral cost-sharing contract can encourage the manufacturer to increase emission reduction investment, the retailer to increase low-carbon promotion investment, and can achieve a Pareto improvement of both parties' profits and utilities. In addition, the two cost-sharing ratios are only proportional to the marginal revenue and fairness concern intensity of both parties. Finally, when the two cost-sharing ratios and the revenue-sharing coefficient meet a certain relationship and are within a reasonable range, the bilateral cost sharing-revenue sharing hybrid contract can reduce the double marginal effect and achieve supply chain coordination.",1
"A challenge in the integration of renewable and alternative energy systems for buildings is the determination of the renewable energy ratio, which involves the selection and sizing of appropriate building systems. To address this need, a micro climate-weather software titled the Vertical City Weather Generator (VCWG) is further developed to include renewable and alternative energy systems and account for full two-way interaction between the building system and outdoor environment. VCWG is forced to simulate performance of a residential building in Guelph, Canada, for an entire year in 2015. Various energy options are considered and further optimized for the building to reduce natural gas consumption, electricity consumption, and cost. On an annual basis using the global cost method, and compared to a building with no such renewable or alternative energy systems, the optimized system resulted in 80.3% savings in natural gas consumption, 73.4% savings in electricity consumption, and 3% savings is annualized cost. According to this analysis, some technologies, such as photovoltaics are more favorable in the Canadian climate than other technologies. It is suggested that the building optimization process is not unique, and it depends on background climate, optimization weighing factors, and assumptions used in the economic analysis, which require further research.",1
"This study takes a systematic approach to quantify variability and uncertainty in the cost of carbon capture and storage (CCS) for new pulverized coal-fired power plants in China under a common costing framework and examines the role of economic and policy strategies in facilitating CCS deployment. The CCS cost varies with key parameters including capacity factor, fixed charge factor, coal price, plant location, and CO2 removal efficiency. Given the probability distribution assumptions for uncertain parameters, results from the probability analysis show that the addition of amine-based CCS for 90% CO2 capture would increase the plant cost of electricity generation significantly by 58%-108% in comparison with the plant without CCS at 95-percent confidence and result in a CO2 avoidance cost within the 95-percent confidence interval from $35/tonne to $67/tonne, which is much lower than in other countries. With the nominal assumptions made for the base case study, an emission tax policy to encourage CCS implementation for 90% CO2 capture at the baseload coal-fired plants requires a CO2 price of $41/tonne, while a CO2 sale price of $24/tonne is needed for CO2-enhanced oil recovery operations to offset the added cost for CCS.",1
"Technological advances have the potential to balance climate change mitigation and economic development. However, it remains unclear how much technological advances alone can mitigate climate change and the associated economic losses in the future. Through designing a suite of technological advances scenarios and using an earth system model with an integrated assessment model, we illustrate that rapid technological progress without production control might achieve the 2 degrees C global warming target in the 2100s. Relative to a world of stagnant technology, the frequency (intensity) of extreme warm events at the end of the 21st century (2081-2100) would be reduced by similar to 21% (5.5 degrees C) via rapid technological advances, with a reduction in extreme precipitation (droughts) by similar to 41% (10 times). Furthermore, fast technological advances may reduce the global economic losses linked with climate change at 2081-2100 by similar to 21% and those in China related to floods (droughts) by 86% (67%). Our results highlight the potential of technological advances to fill the emission gap between the Paris Agreement and unconditional Nationally Determined Contributions and hence to efficiently mitigate global warming.",1
"The lack of sustainable public transport, heavy traffic, and floods are some of the major problems that the Philippines are experiencing throughout the years. Fossil fuel is a limited source of energy and it contributes to the destruction of the ecosystem, which is why more sustainable alternatives are needed. In addition, heavy traffic makes it difficult for people to travel around the metro that eventually affects productivity, efficiency and causes unnecessary stress and sickness. Flooding has also claimed the lives of many people; some have died because they have drowned or because of the strong current of the flood, while some died due to slow response of rescuers because of extremely inaccessible paths. The research revolves around conceptualizing a three-wheeled electric vehicle with amphibious characteristics (waterproof electric motor, sealed body) to tackle the problems discussed earlier. A vehicle that will not be heavy on the budget which will make it accessible to most people; the problem with most amphibious or electric vehicles that exists today is that the features or specifications, or simply the build, is extremely high-tech and thus expensive and scarce. It will serve as a multi-purpose vehicle for public utility/transportation, recreation, and or for emergency and rescue operations. The group believes that electricity is a better alternative than fossil fuels n consideration to climate change mitigation and adaptation. In addition, focusing on public transport that will carry multiple passengers would hopefully reduce current traffic and emissions.",1
"A new multi-attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) method is presented to evaluate, on the basis of conflicting attributes (environmental, economic, and technical), the alternatives in a renewable energy technology (RET) selection problem in an uncertain environment. Trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy linguistic numbers (TrIFLNs) are used to treat the uncertainty, and the attribute weights are not known. To evaluate the weights, possibility theory and the Shannon entropy are used. Possibility theory covers the maximum ambiguity of the data, while the Shannon entropy preserves the weighting properties. An improved aggregation operator using Einstein's operation laws, called the trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy linguistic Einstein's interactive weighted average (TrIFLEIWA) operator, is developed to aggregate the decision experts' assessments. The TrIFLEIWA operator overcomes some of the drawbacks previously identified in the existing aggregation operators, and reduces information loss. Furthermore, the VIKOR (VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje) method is advanced for the MAGDM problem in the intuitionistic fuzzy linguistic environment based on TrIFLNs. The VIKOR method emphasizes prioritizing and selecting alternatives from the available options, maintaining maximum utility from the majority and lowest personal regret from the opponent. TrIFLNs provide accessibility to represent the data in a proper and informative manner. Thus, integrating the VIKOR approach and TrIFLNs provides good results with the flexibility to use in other uncertain environments. A real-world problem of RET selection is included to present numerical insights. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated by comparing it with different MAGDM methods.",1
"Land use, land use change, and forestry (LULUCF) activities, including deforestation and forest restoration, will play an important role in addressing climate change. Countries have stated their contributions to reducing emissions and enhancing sinks in their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs); in 2023, the Global Stocktake will assess the collective impact of these NDCs. Clarity in the contribution of LULUCF to NDC targets is necessary to prevent high LULUCF uncertainties from undermining the strength and clarity of mitigation in other sectors. We assess and categorize all 167 NDCs and find wide variation in how they incorporate LULUCF; many lack the clear information necessary to understand what land-based mitigation is anticipated. The land sector is included in 121 NDCs, but only 11 provide a LULUCF target that can be fully quantified using information presented or referenced in the NDC. By developing alternative scenarios from a subset of 62 NDCs (89 countries), we estimate that ambiguity in LULUCF contributions causes an uncertainty range in the anticipated LULUCF sink in 2030 of magnitude 2.9 GtCO2eq/year-larger in size than our best estimate for the LULUCF sink of -2 GtCO2eq/year. Clearer communication of data sources and assumptions underlying the contribution of land use to mitigation efforts is therefore important for ensuring a robust Global Stocktake and ambitious emissions reductions. We find that guidance under the Paris Agreement may improve the clarity of future NDCs but is not sufficient to eliminate ambiguities. We therefore recommend that LULUCF targets should be presented and accounted for separately from other sectors. Plain Language Summary Land-based activities, including reducing deforestation and planting forests, play an important role in addressing climate change. Under the Paris Agreement, 195 countries agreed to produce national climate change action plans for reducing their emissions. Many of these plans already include land-based activities, but there is currently no common rule set for how to do so in a scientifically robust way. Our study shows that most national climate action plans are ambiguous in how land-based activities will contribute to reducing emissions. This makes it difficult to track the role of land-based activities in global efforts to address climate change and leaves the door open for countries to use uncertain land-based mitigation to offset emissions from burning fossil fuels. We estimate that this ambiguity causes an uncertainty of similar to 3 GtCO2/year in 2030; this is larger than our estimate of the total human-made land use sink in 2030 (-2 GtCO2/year). Recently, countries agreed a set of guidance for how to describe their climate change action plans. This guidance will help to reduce some ambiguity in the role of land-based mitigation, but it is not sufficient to eliminate ambiguity. We recommend that countries should keep their land-based mitigation plans separate from targets in other sectors.",1
"Climate change mitigation involves reducing fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, which is expensive, particularly under stringent mitigation targets. The co-benefits of reducing air pollutants and improving human health are often ignored, but can play significant roles in decision-making. In this study, we quantified the co-benefits of climate change mitigation on ambient air quality and human health in both physical and monetary terms with a particular focus on Asia, where air quality will likely be degraded in the next few decades if mitigation measures are not undertaken. We used an integrated assessment framework that incorporated economic, air chemistry transport, and health assessment models. Air pollution reduction through climate change mitigation under the 2 degrees C goal could reduce premature deaths in Asia by 0.79 million (95% confidence interval: 0.75-1.8 million) by 2050. This co-benefit is equivalent to a life value savings of approximately 2.8 trillion United States dollars (USD) (6% of the gross domestic product [GDP]), which is decidedly more than the climate mitigation cost (840 billion USD, 2% of GDP). At the national level, India has the highest potential net benefit of 1.4 trillion USD, followed by China (330 billion USD) and Japan (68 billion USD). Furthermore, in most Asian countries, per capita GDP gain and life value savings would increase with per capita GDP increasing. We robustly confirmed this qualitative conclusion under several socioeconomic and exposureresponse function assumptions.",1
"Under the necessity for urban energy savings and the importance of energy demand changes, this paper proposes energy analytics of urban buildings using a novel clustering method with open data. In the proposed method, the concept of energy signatures is introduced, and the signatures are defined as the representative symbols in the symbolic hierarchical clustering. This method can advance the existing clustering method or symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX) with limited energy usage patterns by introducing energy signatures with various pieces of energy information into the symbolic transformation. The proposed method can scientifically support tracking building energy usage and patterns, evaluating the existing concepts (such as green retrofitting and zero energy buildings) and advanced technologies, and the decision-making process for new policies under the global carbon neutrality scenarios. In a case study applied to a city using open energy data (in South Korea), the proposed method determined five representative clusters/areas, revealing the open data quality problems (anomaly and missing data), energy usage changes (e.g., energy usage polarization) caused by COVID-19, and the necessity of classifying building types in terms of energy usage patterns. Specifically, the cluster for decreasing energy patterns accounted for approximately 37%, and the increasing patterns accounted for 25%. Educational buildings accounted for 70% of the decreasing patterns, and technical and medical research facilities accounted for 76% of the increasing patterns under the COVID-19. Approximately 93% of missing data was found in the residential buildings. Anomaly data accounted for 10.9% in the total data.",1
"To expand the use of renewable energy, it is necessary to optimize energy production at a local level through an appropriate combination of different renewable energy resources. Additionally, the environmental impacts from the use of renewable resources must be considered from different perspectives. Thus, this study aims to develop a decision tool that evaluates and optimizes the renewable energy mix at a regional scale with regard to various environmental impacts. This tool was developed by creating a municipal energy database that includes five renewable energies (solar, wind, small- and medium-scale hydro, geothermal and biomass energy) and six evaluation indicators (proportion of developed renewable energy, economic balance, installed wind power, decrease in CO2 emissions, circulation rate of biomass resource, and impacted ecosystem area). Specifying different constraints in the model allowed investigation of the optimal renewable energy combination in a study area for two different scenarios, with the results highlighting the trade-offs between the scenarios. We also optimized the combination of different renewable energies for every municipality across Japan, while incorporating the natural conditions and varying demand structure. In conclusion, the tool developed in this study could support decision-making regarding the development of renewable energy resources. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",1
"Lignocellulosic and algal biomasses are known to be vital feedstocks to establish a green hydrogen supply chain toward achieving a carbon-neutral society. However, one of the most pressing issues to be addressed is the low digestibility of these biomasses in biorefinery processes, such as dark fermentation, to produce green hydrogen. To date, various pretreatment approaches, such as physical, chemical, and biological methods, have been examined to enhance feedstock digestibility. However, neither systematic reviews of pretreatment to promote biohydrogen production in dark fermentation nor economic feasibility analyses have been conducted. Thus, this study offers a comprehensive review of current biomass pretreatment methods to promote biohydrogen production in dark fermentation. In addition, this review has provided comparative analyses of the technological and economic feasibility of existing pretreatment techniques and discussed the prospects of the pretreatments from the standpoint of carbon neutrality and circular economy.",1
"The use of renewable energy is a major trend to meet datacenters energy needs. However, its intermittent nature requires energy storage devices to store the over produced energy when not being used. Thus, the green coverage value, representing the fraction of total energy consumption covered by renewable energy, is increased. In this paper, we analyze the impact of using different battery sizes to optimize renewable energy usage. We have built a battery simulation tool able to provide the battery state, track the amount of stored and used energy by the battery as a function of the energy consumed by a datacenter and the energy produced by solar panels. We show the impact of battery size on the green coverage percentage, green energy loss, and brown energy taken from the traditional grid. A comparison of these metrics is made for three different geographical locations at 10 degrees, 35 degrees, and 60 degrees latitude. We discuss the competitiveness of constructing datacenters in different geographical locations based on the results.",1
"This article studies a green-energy-powered cognitive radio network (GCRN) in an underlay paradigm, wherein multiple battery-free secondary users (SUs) capture both the spectrum and the energy of primary users (PUs) to communicate with an access point (AP). By time division multiple access, each SU transmits data to AP in the allocated time and harvests energy from the RF signals of PUs otherwise, all in the same licensed spectrum concurrently with PUs. Thus, the transmit power of each SU is jointly constrained by the peak interference power at PU and the harvested energy of SU. With the formulated green coexistence paradigm, we investigate the sum-throughput maximization problem with respect to time and power allocation, which is non-convex. To obtain the optimal resource allocation, we propose a joint optimal time and power allocation (JOTPA) algorithm that first transforms the original problem into a convex optimization problem with respect to time and energy allocation, and then solve it by iterative Lagrange dual decomposition. To comprehensively evaluate the performance of the GCRN with JOTPA, we deploy the GCRN in three typical scenarios and compare JOTPA with the equal time and optimal power allocation (ETOPA) algorithm. Extensive simulations show that the deployment of the GCRN significantly influences the throughput performance and JOTPA outperforms ETOPA under all considered scenarios.",0
"With the increasingly stringent regulations on emission abatement, the emission abatement strategies are imperative for shipping companies, but which are complicated by the fluctuating fuel price and a growing ban on open-loop scrubbers. Thus, this paper studies the choice of sulfur emission reduction technologies on a shipping route. Aiming at obtaining an economical and low risk program on a pre-defined shipping line during the whole ship lifespan, a two-stage distributionally robust with mean conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) optimization is employed to solve the sulfur emission reduction technologies choice problem. The objective function is formulated as a composition of conditional risk measures. Three kinds of ambiguity sets are used to character the uncertainties, and the model is further transformed into a tractable linear programming problem. An Asian service route is selected as a numerical experiment. The results show that the proposed model is effective and hybrid scrubber is a more suitable choice. Last, managerial implications and insights of sulfur emission reduction technologies choice in shipping are developed.",1
"Many governments have imposed methods such as a carbon tax that aim to even out the negative effects of carbon emissions. The taxes levied on different agents lead to different make-buy decisions for production structures and different environmental outcomes. Some original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) outsource remanufacturing to independent remanufacturers (IRs). Thus, a question arises: What are the implications of carbon taxes levied on different agents on remanufacturing outsourcing decisions? To answer this question, we developed two models: (1) acting as common brand owners, OEMs can be taxed for both new and remanufactured products, or (2) acting as different emitters for production and remanufacturing, OEMs are taxed for new products; however, all carbon taxes related to remanufacturing are levied on IRs. Our analysis reveals that, regarding economic performance, firms should undertake a carbon emission tax on their own initiative because this allows the taxpayer to choose more units for its preferred products and leaves its rivals at a huge disadvantage. Moreover, regarding environmental sustainability, carbon emission taxes indeed lead to mitigating the effects of carbon emissions per unit; however, environmental agencies should also pay attention to reducing the total carbon emissions by limiting the volume effects.",1
"The energy transition is constantly evolving and new European energy models are emerging within Smart Grids, called CERs or Renewable Energy Communities, which bring benefits in terms of energy, but above all economic, social and environmental. Fundamental for their realization, as well as the development of Smart Grids, is the implementation of renewable plants, and a series of dedicated energy technologies, devices and software, which allow the monitoring, management and control of energy, through not only the Prosumers, but also the end customers, who, despite not having energy available from renewable sources, want to use it mainly. Another key element is played by energy storage and electric vehicles, which allow to implement VPPs, in this way collective self-consumption systems, through distributed energy generation, represent a step towards the reduction of energy poverty and the implementation of energy efficiency. In fact, the political push given by the Energy Efficiency Directive, on information to consumers and the introduction of smart meters, will represent an added value to the diffusion of intelligent and connected appliances for the smart home, in which energy consumers become active elements, not only if they are also self-producers. Finally, a further key element will be represented by the possibility of exchanging flows of energy and virtual currency, such as RESCoins, through Blockchain technology. With this paper we want to define not only the state of the art of the RECs, but to define the further key points for their concrete use.",1
"Beef production is the primary contributor to greenhouse gas emissions in animal husbandry. But the carbon emission distribution, potential for carbon reduction, and pathways in the main links of the beef cattle industry chain are not yet clear. Balancing efficiency and fairness while taking tailored emission reduction paths according to local conditions is crucial in helping to achieve the low-carbon animal husbandry and dual carbon goals. This research adopts an industry chain perspective to assess four leading beef production regions' carbon emissions, potential, and pathways in China from 2007 to 2021. We use life cycle assessment, the potential index which considers efficiency and fairness; the results are as follows: (1) The potential for carbon emission reduction in China's beef industry showed an inverted U-shaped change trend from 2007 to 2021, and the average potential for carbon emission reduction in most provinces fluctuated around 0.500. (2) The main producing areas of China's beef industry were divided into four areas of high efficiency and low fairness (Area A); high efficiency and high fairness (Area B); low efficiency and low fairness (Area C); and low efficiency and high fairness (Area D). (3) Differentiated emission reduction pathways were designed to reduce emissions, highlighting the need to implement region-specific carbon reduction policies.",1
"A renewable energy matrix plays a fundamental role in providing energy services in a sustainable platform and, particularly, to reduce climate change on a global basis. However, alternative energy sources usually poses extra challenges to adopters due to higher costs, mainly in the developing and emerging countries where: 1) basic needs still remain to be covered, and 2) top technologies, such as the required in those initiatives, are likely not to be promptly available. This article aims to verify the status of the current renewable energy sources contribution to the regular energy systems of some countries across the Latin American region as a measure to reduce the adverse impact over the average temperature and extreme climate events. Latin America, despite its vast territory and considerable availability of natural resources which could well place the region in a leading position in terms of alternative energy is still in the early stages of having the mindset and infrastructure required to respond to the current environmental challenges. This exploratory study compares the database of renewable energy and climate change drivers of some Latin American countries, seeking to verify similarities and differences, as well as the possible effect of strategies and government policies, barriers and issues in the generation of an energy system that support the region economic growth while following the key principles of sustainability. For our research, we use Multivariate Analysis based on a large set of available and updated open public indicators to establish critical areas and regional progress. The main finding is that, if not at length comparable to the leading EU countries and other advanced economies in the matter, some countries in the region have been presenting important advances to date, being able to combine economic growth to friendly-environmental practices often a hard equation to solve while others, on the contrary, stay behind in sustainable practices. Most importantly, at last, is the highlight of initiatives that stand out as positive examples having helped mitigate the environmental burden, clearly pointing towards solutions to the challenge of having sustainable development inclusive practices in the Latin American region.",1
"Energy efficiency plays a central role in climate change mitigation policies. Countries are using different methods to estimate energy savings from energy efficiency improvements. Improved methods to measure energy efficiency savings are adopted mainly in countries with mandatory energy efficiency targets. They use bottom-up and top-down methods to enhance the reliability of savings estimates. India has implemented various energy efficiency measures, and the impact of most of the schemes is estimated using the simplified deemed savings bottom-up approach. Index Decomposition Analysis is a top-down approach, but its use in India is limited due to a lack of reliable national energy balances. This study uses India's energy balances from International Energy Agency to estimate the energy efficiency savings in India during 2011-19. It is found that the IDA estimates are lower than the government's deemed savings estimates. The underlying assumptions in the simplified deemed savings approach may overestimate savings, or savings from index decomposition analysis may be underestimated due to data limitations. Improved methods and reliable and timely data is essential for measuring energy savings from energy efficiency. National-level targets on energy efficiency can push improvements in energy savings measurement techniques. The targets can also address several barriers in the energy efficiency markets.",1
"This study applies asymmetric causality to renewable energy (REC), carbon dioxide emissions (CE), and real GDP using non-linear broadcasting between these variables through the non-linear autoregressive distributed lag model (NARDL) to examine the short- and long-run asymmetries in the inconsistency of greenhouse gas emissions among the variables and to unpack the asymmetric causality of selective variables through positive and negative shocks for time series data from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia between 1990 and 2014. The bounds cointegration test shows the existence of long-term dealings among all considered variables in the presence of asymmetry. The non-linear asymmetric causality test shows that negative shocks in carbon dioxide emissions had only positive impacts on real GDP in the long-term but are unobservable in the short-term. Additionally, the short- and the long-term incidences of positive shocks on real GDP are not similar to the negative shock to REC, implying the existence of asymmetric impacts on REC in both short- and long-term forms. Finally, the asymmetric causal relationship from carbon dioxide emissions to REC is neutral in the long-term. Both positive and negative shocks to REC consistently had an adverse effect on CE in the long-term. The presence of asymmetry between economic growth, CE, and REC could be of major substantial for more helpful policymakers and the action plan of sustainable development goals (SDGs) in Saudi Arabia.",1
"In this paper, a novel topology of the high step-up multiphase galvanically isolated impedance-source DC-DC converter is proposed. It was derived by the input-parallel-output-parallel cascading of the asymmetrical quasi-Z-source half-bridge cells. The operating principle of the converter is explained by the steady state analysis. It was also demonstrated how the input current ripple of the converter could be decreased by increasing the number of interleaved phases. To validate our approach experimentally, a two-phase DC-DC converter with the power rating of 300 W was assembled. It was confirmed that the proposed converter is capable of ensuring the six-fold regulation of the input voltage with the maximum DC gain of 40 and peak efficiency of 94.5%.",0
"Technology transfer plays a key role in global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In this paper, we characterize the factors that promote or hinder the international diffusion of climate-friendly technologies using detailed patent data from 96 countries for the period 1995-2007. The data provide strong evidence that lax Intellectual Property regimes have a strong and negative impact on the international diffusion of patented knowledge. Restrictions on international trade and foreign direct investment also hinder the diffusion of climate-friendly technologies. Surprisingly, local technological capabilities tend to discourage transfers. While broad indicators of technology capabilities are expected to facilitate transfers, this latter result stems from our technology-specific definition of local capabilities, which makes it possible to capture a substitution effect between local and foreign inventions.",1
"Deterministic constrained optimization and stochastic optimization approaches were used to evaluate uncertainties in biomass-integrated microgrids supplying both electricity and heat. An economic linear programming model with a sliding time window was developed to assess design and scheduling of biomass combined heat and power (BCHP) based microgrid systems. Other available technologies considered within the microgrid were small-scale wind turbines, photovoltaic modules (PV), producer gas storage, battery storage, thermal energy storage and heat-only boilers. As an illustrative example, a case study was examined for a conceptual utility grid-connected microgrid application in Davis, California. The results show that for the assumptions used, a BCHP/PV with battery storage combination is the most cost effective design based on the assumed energy load profile, local climate data, utility tariff structure, and technical and financial performance of the various components of the microgrid. Monte Carlo simulation was used to evaluate uncertainties in weather and economic assumptions, generating a probability density function for the cost of energy. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

"Climate change has taken an increasingly important space in the development agenda. However, whether most countries can meet the challenge of mitigating climate change while simultaneously ensuring growth and poverty reduction remains debatable. This research contributes to the growing literature at the intersection of environment sustainability and economic/industrial development by identifying three dimensions of Green Industrial Policy (GIP), which rely on different approaches to mitigate climate change. Those three dimensions are (i) the consumption-centred dimension; (ii) the firm-level sustainability dimension, and (iii) the productionist innovation-driven dimension. This paper then applies this green industrial policy framework and examines the implications of pursuing different levels of GIP by drawing on a country case study (Ecuador). Two main findings arise from this study. First, a greener consumption is necessary but can hardly be achieved without industrial policies to stimulate green manufacturing and low-carbon innovation. Green industrial policy, therefore, has a central role to play in the structural transformation towards a low-carbon future. Second, a holistic and complementary approach is needed across the three dimensions of green industrial policy to ensure a coherent and developmental transition towards a low-carbon economy.",1
"This research unveils the effect of economic policy uncertainty on renewable energy in G7 while technological innovation is used as a control variable by employing a quantile on quantile approach. The outcome explores the negative effect of economic policy uncertainty on renewable energy across all quantiles. Moreover, the relationship is detected mostly in upper quantiles and the coefficients reveal varying effects. Furthermore, the negative impact of economic policy uncertainty on renewable energy and vice versa is recorded in Canada, France, Germany, the UK, and the U.S. On the other hand, Italy and Japan record negative effects of economic policy uncertainty on renewable energy in the medium to upper quantiles, and a positive impact is observed from renewable energy to economic policy uncertainty in higher to lower quantiles. The positive impact of technological innovation on renewable energy is detected in the medium quantiles for all the G7 countries. Our results are in line with the general equilibrium model (GEM) that explains the negative influence of economic policy uncertainty on renewable energy development and vice versa. The government policy and regulatory framework consistency are paramount in renewable development. (C) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",1
"The urbanization and increase in the human population has significantly influenced the global energy demands. The utilization of non-renewable fossil fuel-based energy infra-structure involves air pollution, global warming due to CO2 emissions, greenhouse gas emissions, acid rains, diminishing energy resources, and environmental degradation leading to climate change due to global warming. These factors demand the exploration of alternative energy sources based on renewable sources. Hydrogen, an efficient energy carrier, has emerged as an alternative fuel to meet energy demands and green hydrogen production with zero carbon emission has gained scientific attraction in recent years. This review is focused on the production of hydrogen from renewable sources such as biomass, solar, wind, geothermal, and algae and conventional non-renewable sources including natural gas, coal, nuclear and thermochemical processes. Moreover, the cost analysis for hydrogen production from each source of energy is discussed. Finally, the impact of these hydrogen production processes on the environment and their implications are summarized.(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

"A 100% renewable energy-based stand-alone microgrid system can be developed by robust energy storage systems to stabilize the variable and intermittent renewable energy resources. Hydrogen as an energy carrier and energy storage medium has gained enormous interest globally in recent years. Its use in stand-alone or off-grid microgrids for both the urban and rural communities has commenced recently in some locations. Therefore, this research evaluates the techno-economic feasibility of renewable energy-based systems using hydrogen as energy storage for a stand-alone/off-grid microgrid. Three case scenarios in a microgrid environment were identified and investigated in order to select an optimum solution for a remote community by considering the energy balance and techno-economic optimization. The HOMER Pro energy modelling and simulating software was used to compare the energy balance, economics and environmental impact amongst the proposed scenarios. The simulation results showed that the hydrogen-battery hybrid energy storage system is the most cost-effective scenario, though all developed scenarios are technically possible and economically comparable in the long run, while each has different merits and challenges. It has been shown that the proposed hybrid energy systems have significant potentialities in electrifying remote communities with low energy generation costs, as well as a contribution to the reduction of their carbon footprint and to ameliorating the energy crisis to achieve a sustainable future.",1
"The limited regulation capacity of the power grid, coupled with the imperfect market mechanism, has squeezed the space for renewable energy consumption in China. This article proposes a renewable energy consumption mechanism through the monthly interprovincial transaction market, to balance the revenue of each market participant and improve the consumption of renewable energy. A new player named interprovincial traders is introduced to serve as the middleman for the renewable generation, users, and the power grid company. The main function of interprovincial traders is to coordinate and match the user load with the output of renewable energy. In such a market mechanism, the social factors, influenced by the revenue of each trading cycle, are considered in the user responding model from the perspective of consumer psychology. Finally, a two-phase optimization model is proposed to promote renewable energy consumption coordination with the monthly interprovincial market. The optimization model is simulated in a provincial power grid example. The results show that the model can effectively increase the consumption of renewable energy as well as improve the profit of power grid companies and users.",1
"Climate change disproportionately affects Indigenous Peoples because of strong connections between environmental, cultural, and spiritual well-being. While much of the global discourse surrounding climate change is founded in Western science, the holistic, place-based knowledge of Indigenous Peoples offers a complementary way of understanding and mitigating climate change impacts. The goal of this research was to elevate Anishinaabe concerns, observations, and perspectives about climate change impacts and future research needs. We organized a workshop called Connecting Guardians in a Changing World where participants shared concerns about animal and plant life cycles, water cycles and water quality, and impacts to ways of life, including reduced capacity to perform cultural practices and erosion of their knowledge. Participants highlighted the challenge of prioritizing a single impact of climate change, emphasizing that impacts to the environment and ways of life are interconnected. Participants also expressed the need for research and policy that move beyond interdisciplinarity to include intercultural philosophy and research that better reflects Indigenous worldviews and incorporates Indigenous methodologies. Moving forward, meaningful partnerships and opportunities for knowledge sharing should be prioritized in climate change discourse to ensure solutions are generated together, with all of the tools and knowledge available.",1
"Potential conflicts exist between biodiversity conservation and climate-change mitigation as trade-offs in multiple-use land management. This study aims to evaluate public preferences for biodiversity conservation and climate-change mitigation policy considering respondents' uncertainty on their choice. We conducted a choice experiment using land-use scenarios in the rural Kushiro watershed in northern Japan. The results showed that the public strongly wish to avoid the extinction of endangered species in preference to climate-change mitigation in the form of carbon sequestration by increasing the area of managed forest. Knowledge of the site and the respondents' awareness of the personal benefits associated with supporting and regulating services had a positive effect on their preference for conservation plans. Thus, decision-makers should be careful about how they provide ecological information for informed choices concerning ecosystem services tradeoffs. Suggesting targets with explicit indicators will affect public preferences, as well as the willingness of the public to pay for such measures. Furthermore, the elicited-choice probabilities approach is useful for revealing the distribution of relative preferences for incomplete scenarios, thus verifying the effectiveness of indicators introduced in the experiment.

"Affected by income level, household type, and other socioeconomic factors, carbon inequality among households substantially differs across prefectures in Japan, thereby profoundly affecting the country's sustainable devel-opment. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the carbon footprint of different households on the basis of sys-tematically grouped income levels and evaluate carbon inequality in all prefectures. Using the 2005 multi -regional input-output table of Japan, we identified detailed structures of household carbon footprint (HCF) across single-and multi-person households of different income levels in Japan's 47 prefectures. We elucidated carbon inequality across prefectures through the carbon footprint Gini coefficients of the aforementioned households. The results showed that substantial differences in HCF exist among prefectures, thus contributing to variances in carbon inequality levels. Multi-person households are currently the main contributors to Japan's HCF, but the contribution of single-person households has considerable potential to grow. Income level has the most direct influence on HCF, which considerably determines the amount and structure of household con-sumption. Changes in carbon inequality among prefectures indicate that the aggravation of income inequality widens the HCF gap among income groups-a situation inconducive to the reduction of per-household CF during climate mitigation.",1
"Investment in renewable energy, such as building photovoltaic (PV), has higher volatility than normal products due to uncertain product performance and such high uncertainties become the roadblock to the growth of renewable energy market. Previous studies focus on diffusion of innovation from macro aspect but ignore the managerial flexibility of individual's investment. This paper established a novel diffusion model that integrates agent-based modelling (ABM), real option and social networks to assess the propagation of renewable energy adoption. The proposed model incorporates the heterogeneity of individuals' risk preferences into real option decision to determine one's willingness to invest renewable energy. The perceptual risks vary through one's interaction with network peers after knowing the past experiences from those peers. The model is then applied to the residential PV diffusion in Singapore, with results that validate the effectiveness of the model and also imply policy recommendations to stimulate the development of PV market.

"Monitoring vegetation is essential in Earth Observation (EO) due to its link with the global carbon cycle, playing a crucial role in ecosystem management. The fluorescence of chlorophyll (ChF) is a reliable indicator of plants' photosynthetic activity and growth, especially when they are experiencing unfavourable conditions, particularly in terrestrial wetlands. These wetlands are integral components of the landscape, contributing significantly to climate mitigation, adaptation, biodiversity, and the well-being of both the environment and humanity. We conducted a research study using the XGBoost machine learning algorithm to map the chlorophyll fluorescence parameter Fv/Fm in the Biebrza River Valley, which is known for its marshes, peatlands, and diverse flora and fauna. Our study highlights the benefits of using ensemble classifiers derived from EO Sentinel-2 satellite imagery for accurately mapping Fv/Fm across terrestrial landscapes under the Ramsar Convention at Narew River Valley (Poland) and Cepkeliai Marsh (Lithuania). The XGBoost algorithm provides an accurate estimate of ChF with a robust determination coefficient of 0.747 and minimal bias at 0.013, as validated using in situ data. The precision of Fv/Fm chlorophyll fluorescence parameter estimation from remote sensing sensors depends on the growth stage, emphasizing the importance of identifying the optimal overpass time for S-2 observations. Our study found that biophysical factors, as denoted by spectral indices related to greenness and leaf pigments, were highly impactful variables among the top classifiers. However, incorporating soil, vegetation and meteorological indicators from remote sensing data could further increase the accuracy of chlorophyll fluorescence mapping.",1
"This research analyses the convergence of residential electricity prices in 22 European countries between 1995 and 2019. The findings reveal the existence of two sub-convergent clubs of residential electricity prices. Half of the countries studied belong to the club with higher residential electricity prices, while the other half belong to the lower-price club. Household income increases the probability of belonging to the club of lower residential electricity prices. An increase in heating degree days decreases the probability of belonging to the club of lower residential electricity prices. A similar effect is observed for the price of non-renewable energy sources used in electricity production. Further, although a country's likelihood of belonging to the club of lower residential electricity prices diminishes with a rise in the share of renewable electricity production, the converse pattern is obtained at the residential level, such that residential renewable electricity share has a beneficial effect. Our findings suggest that households have benefitted in paying lower prices for renewable sourced electricity. Therefore, this research indicates that ongoing clean energy initiatives and the availability of affordable substitutes for conventionally generated electricity are being realized to a certain extent, improving electricity markets for the countries we analysed.",1
"Anthropogenic climate change threatens the global environment, including biodiversity, and with it continued human welfare. The European Union aims to increase its share of renewable energy (RE) to 20% by 2020 in an effort to reduce greenhause gas emissions while enhancing energy security and providing opportunities for economic development. The Alpine region is expected to contribute significantly to RE expansion. The trade-offs between potential gains and losses, especially for biodiversity, from new RE developments are rarely fully considered even though biodiversity loss has significant economic costs for society. The EU Alpine Space recharge green project develops tools to evaluate the RE carrying capacity of the biodiversity-rich Alpine ecosystems. The tools will aid in the analysis of siting decisions and in weighing up costs and benefits to enable rational energy implementation decisions. The developed tools will be tested in five pilot regions in Austria, Germany, Italy, and Slovenia.",1
"The intended nationally determined contributions were adopted as the national plans for addressing the climate change challenge after 2020, aiming at limiting global warming to 2 or 1.5 degrees C. In this context, energy-saving R&D has become an important way for reducing GHG emissions. This study used a climate-economy integrated assessment model to study the carbon reduction and climate mitigation effects of R&D investment by scenario simulation. The results show that most of the major carbon emitters cannot achieve their INDC targets by continuing their current R&D growth trends. Unless the R&D investment rates of countries increase to radically high levels, global warming by 2100 cannot be controlled to below 2 or 1.5 degrees C even when the major carbon emitters have approached or achieved their INDC targets. Low-carbon technology transfer will obviously reduce the carbon emissions of developing countries, but cannot achieve the 2 degrees C target. Considering the actual R&D capabilities of countries and the economic loss under excessive R&D input, raising R&D rates to approximately 4 or 5 percent and combining them with technology transfer and production damage measures will be a more realistic approach.

"By fully leveraging the mitigating effect of artificial intelligence (AI) on renewable energy, the supply chain vulnerability is referred to as the key to realizing the supply chain's safety, stability, reliability, and the continuous development of global environmental governance. Several databases have been selected here for the assessment: the UN Comtrade database, the global industrial robotics database, and the World Bank database covering the period of 2000 to 2019. This particular study examines the effect and mechanisms of AI on renewable energy supply chain vulnerability and explores the spatial spillover effects of AI in neighboring countries. The relevant findings are threefold. Firstly, the analysis of the mechanism of action demonstrates that AI can alleviate renewable energy supply chain vulnerability through technological innovation, governance system optimization, and trade network status promotion effects. Secondly, the heterogeneity analysis reveals that AI significantly alleviates renewable energy supply chain vulnerability in middle-income countries, highvulnerability products, countries with high popularity of digital infrastructure, and countries in the initial stage of renewable energy industrial development. Thirdly, the spatial econometric results show that AI can directly alleviate domestic renewable energy supply chain vulnerability and indirectly alleviate vulnerability in neighboring countries through spatial spillover effects. This study expands the methods for identifying the impact of external environmental changes on renewable energy supply chain vulnerability. It provides an empirical reference for policymakers and professionals to maintain the security, stability, and reliability of renewable energy supply chains in the AI era.",1
"In the aftermath of the Paris Agreements, many countries around the globe have pledged to reduce the amount of greenhouse gas emissions being released into the atmosphere. To do so, it is important that the amount of renewable energy in the electricity grid increases. However, there are worries of the capacity of the grid to cope with intermittent energy sources. To assess the feasibility of a 100% renewable energy system in Japan, the authors conducted an hourly simulation of future electricity production based on wind, solar and tidal data. The system was shown to be stable, and the authors calculated the required capacity of electrical batteries that would be necessary to balance such a system.",1
"The study aims to understand the relationship between organised civil society and the energy transition. It is carried out by using a mixed qualitative method combining a systematic literature review, identifying the role of organised civil society within the energy transition internationally, and 18 interviews focusing on the development of Renewable Energy Communities in Italy and the potential position held by organised civil society in these collective actions which are transforming the energy system. The results demonstrate that such actors can contribute to the transition process as well as to the establishment of a new virtuous ecosystem.",1
"Over the last few decades, the implementation of emission regulation by the government due to the impact of emissions from the industrial sector on the environment has included a rough demotivation among the small and moderate manufacturing industries. In the recent market situation, it is observed that, consumers much prefer to purchase eco-friendly products. Further, in the highly imprecise competitive market, it is rather a complicated task for a competent authority/operator of every manufacturing company to make an appropriate decision regarding marketing policy of the firm. Taking these three factors into account, this work aims to formulate the model of a production system that can benefit such manufacturers who are dealing with these three issues. This model is developed using interval modelling technique, and it is solved by using optimal control in interval uncertainty. Regarding emission tax estimation, two distinct cases appear to the manufacturer, which are explained separately. After the numerical analysis of the proposed model, it contemporarily observed that for a small/moderate manufacturing sector, adoption of emission reduction technology appears to be more beneficiary rather than paying emission tax free of reduction technology. Further, greenness index for the manufactured items imposes considerably-sensitive impact on the revenue of the system. Therefore the major contribution of the model is to investigate an emergent business policy for a manufacturing firm of green products under emission taxation regulation so that it may influence small and moderate manufacturers to set up their best -found marketing policies.",1
"This paper brings into attention a new method for analyzing renewable energy investments efficiency, a procedure called Principal Component Analysis. Authors aim to provide an adequate background for this method, before applying it to a set of data concerning renewable energy. The paper begins by describing the method, highlighting aspects that differentiate it from other method previously used to study the same issue. A brief literature review is included, as it was important to substantiate the role of Principal Component Analysis as a dimension-reduction tool and support to new indices development. The Principal Component Analysis terminology is shortly discussed and the first step for applying the method is undertaken: the study of correlation among variables. This assumption is validated by calculating Pearson's correlation coefficient and representing the correlation matrix. Different types of correlation are obtained according to the presented variation intervals. So, the Principal Component Analysis appliance is once more justified for developing efficiency indices.",0
"Although grassroots initiatives in the renewable energy transition are flourishing, their embeddedness in local contexts challenges their capacity to spread their impact on a broader scale. Certainly, while scaling up has been described as difficult to combine with local embeddedness, little is known on the specific nature of the tensions involved in combining the two. Studying a federation of citizen renewable energy (RE) cooperatives in the south of France, we show that the engagement in a scaling-up process at a regional level generates three main kinds of tensions associated with specific dimensions of local embeddedness: natural, cultural, and political. We emphasize how these dimensions are likely to be threatened when the federation engages the cooperatives in a rapid scaling-up dynamic in which the drive to industrialize projects and find funding is dominant. We acknowledge the effects of these tensions on grassroots sustainability initiatives and collective organizing processes.",1
"In the coming four-decade, China will face serious challenge while shifting to carbon neutral. Photovoltaic (PV) power, as one of the most promising clean energies, is seen as an important focus for decarbonization of the power sector in China. The novelty of this s study is to use life cycle assessment (LCA) methods to analyze the CO2 emission reduction of the PV generation industry before 2060 base on the amount of energy and resources consumed and PV generation's CO2 reduction benefits during the whole industrial chain. This paper aims to examine CO2 emission reduction contribution, we firstly compute the historical emissions and predict future PV waste and new power capacity from 2010 to 2060. Then, considering the change of industrial structure and technological evolution, the yearly life cycle CO2 emission from producing stage to recycling stage is calculated. The key results show that the unit CO2 emission of PV system producing will reduce 88.07% from 2010 to 2060. PV generation industry's total CO2 emission has reached its neutrality between 2014 and 2015, and will reduce 33.03 Giga tons CO2-eq till 2060. The findings can offer relevant insights to low-carbon development of China's PV industry and will provide suggestions for policy-making.",1
"Limiting greenhouse gas emissions has continually gained importance since the Kyoto protocol became effective in 2005. A variety of efforts have been made to reduce energy consumption and introduce supposedly clean and renewable energy that can replace fossil fuelbased energy sources. However, many clean energy sources are not economically viable by themselves, and, therefore, government subsidies are necessary to provide sufficient economic motivation for the installation of new types of energy. For that reason, it is necessary to develop a method for reasonably and accurately determining an appropriate level of government subsidy for private entities. In this paper we propose a real option-based framework for rationally quantifying the amount of government subsidy required by private entities in order to implement a clean energy generation system. A case study that involved the installation of a photovoltaic system in an average household in Seoul, Korea was conducted in order to verify the proposed framework. The proposed framework is expected to help energy policymakers choose the proper level of government subsidy that will effectively encourage private entities to install clean energy systems without wasting taxpayers' money.

"In the frame of density functional theory (DFT), structural, thermoelectric, electronic, and optical features of cubic X2ScAgCl6 (X = K, Na) double perovskite are studied. The outcomes of formation energy (delta H) and tolerance factor (tau) confirm the stability of X2ScAgCl6 (X = K, Na) compounds in the cubic phase. K2ScAgCl6 and Na2ScAgCl6 have direct bandgap (E-g) values of 3.65 eV and 3.63 eV, respectively. Optical characteristics such as refractive index n (omega), optical conductivity sigma ( omega), reflectivity R (omega), extinction coefficient k (omega), absorption coefficient alpha(omega), and dielectric constants (epsilon(1), epsilon(2)) are also calculated. Moreover, the thermoelectric features are computed by using BoltzTrap Code. The computed value of figure of merit (ZT) for K2ScAgCl6 and Na2ScAgCl6 is 0.782 and 0.798, respectively shows both compounds are suitable for thermoelectric applications. The analysis of structural and optoelectronic features reveals that the X2ScAgCl6 (A = K, Na) compounds has appropriate photo absorbers tendency for solar cells and ultraviolet (UV) photodetectors.",0
"Although climate change is expected to cause significant negative impacts, climate treaties give hope for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, potentially leading to less severe climate change. However, climate change is a public bad: If each country aims to maximize its own benefit, some countries might free ride and continue to emit GHGs. Consequently, climate treaties have seen limited success, and a central question is how future treaties can achieve GHG emission reduction and also be 'self-enforcing'-where participating countries have no incentive to withdraw or modify their contributions. Here we examine a dynamic negotiation process involving multiple countries, each deciding whether and when to join the agreement and whether to penalize non-participants. In particular, we distinguish between (1) indirect punishment, in which countries invest less in emission reduction in response to non-compliance of other countries, and (2) direct punishment, in which countries impose sanctions, such as punitive tariffs, against countries that do not comply. We analyze the negotiation process using evolutionary game theory. We show that how the two types of punishment are implemented greatly affects the agreement's outcome. In particular, an efficient combination of the punishments could lead to more desirable self-enforcing agreements. These findings indicate that integrating punitive measures with an effective negotiation framework could result in more desirable climate agreements.",0
"Understanding historical forest dynamics, specifically changes in forest biomass and carbon stocks, has become critical for assessing current forest climate benefits and projecting future benefits under various policy, regulatory, and stewardship scenarios. Carbon accounting frameworks based exclusively on national forest inventories are limited to broad-scale estimates, but model-based approaches that combine these inventories with remotely sensed data can yield contiguous fine-resolution maps of forest biomass and carbon stocks across landscapes over time. Here we describe a fundamental step in building a map-based stock-change framework: mapping historical forest biomass at fine temporal and spatial resolution (annual, 30 m) across all of New York State (USA) from 1990 to 2019, using freely available data and open-source tools.Using Landsat imagery, US Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data, and off-the-shelf LiDAR collections we developed three modeling approaches for mapping historical forest aboveground biomass (AGB): training on FIA plot-level AGB estimates (direct), training on LiDAR-derived AGB maps (indirect), and an ensemble averaging predictions from the direct and indirect models. Model prediction surfaces (maps) were tested against FIA estimates at multiple scales. All three approaches produced viable outputs, yet tradeoffs were evident in terms of model complexity, map accuracy, saturation, and fine-scale pattern representation. The resulting map products can help identify where, when, and how forest carbon stocks are changing as a result of both anthropogenic and natural drivers alike. These products can thus serve as inputs to a wide range of applications including stock-change assessments, monitoring reporting and verification frameworks, and prioritizing parcels for protection or enrollment in improved management programs.",1
"We analyse the dynamics of a decision-making process on a contested carbon capture and storage project in The Netherlands by investigating the interactions between the involved stakeholders and how these reinforced, or were shaped by, a meta-frame. Our analysis suggests that from the start of the project, the interactions between stakeholders were shaped by, and reinforced, a goal-rational meta-frame. This frame, and the respective interactions, did not function well in aligning project proponents and the local community. For the latter group, issues were at stake that could not be addressed within the goal-rational frame, such as moral considerations of procedural and distributive justice. Yet it was a very powerful frame that remained dominant and kept being reproduced throughout the process. Our analysis suggests that policy processes on projects like this should create interactions that leave open the opportunity for divergent, latent frames to become articulated. We identify three challenges for policy and planning of low-carbon technologies concerning the need for frame reflexivity in planning and decision making, the articulation of divergent stakeholder views and the design of stakeholder interactions.",1
"There is increasing interest in zero-carbon-emission power to prevent global warming. This study investigated an effective way to minimize the efficiency penalty and achieve near-zero carbon emission in a small-scale triple combined cycle. The power block of the cycle includes a solid oxide fuel cell, micro gas turbine, and organic Rankine cycle. The three oxy-combustion capture systems are a semi-closed cycle, a cycle using an ion transport membrane, and a cycle where the membrane is replaced with an air separation unit. A parametric analysis was performed to determine an optimal pressure ratio for each cycle. The performance characteristics of the three cycles and a cycle with conventional post-combustion capture were compared. It was found out that the cycle using an air separation unit is more efficient than the other two cycles and captures highly pure carbon dioxide. The efficiency penalty due to carbon capture is only 4.4%, resulting in 58% net efficiency. The most significant finding is that using the cryogenic air separation unit is more favorable than using the ion transport membrane to separate oxygen in a small triple combined cycle operating at low pressure, in contrast to one with high pressure.

"Climate change is a politically polarized subject, and changing peoples' beliefs is challenging. This study shows that participation in a climate prediction market by betting on future climate outcomes may be an effective way to change both attitudes and behaviour around climate change. Modifying attitudes and behaviours related to climate change is difficult. Attempts to offer information, appeal to values and norms or enact policies have shown limited success. Here we examine whether participation in a climate prediction market can shift attitudes by having the market act as a non-partisan adjudicator and by prompting participants to put their 'money where their mouth is'. Across two field studies, we show that betting on climate events alters: (1) participants' concern about climate change, (2) support for remedial climate action and (3) knowledge about climate issues. While the effects were dependent on participants' betting performance in Study 1, they were independent of betting outcomes in Study 2. Overall, our findings suggest that climate prediction markets could offer a promising path to changing people's climate-related attitudes and behaviour.",0
"Australia has committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions in a manner consistent with limiting anthropogenic climate change to no more than 2 degrees Celsius. One of the ways in which this commitment is being realised is through a shift towards variable renewable energy (VRE) within Australia's National Electricity Market (NEM). Substituting existing dispatchable thermal plant with VRE requires consideration of long-term energy resource adequacy given the unpredictability of solar and wind resources. While pumped hydro and battery storage are key technologies for addressing short-term mismatches between resource availability and demand, they may be unable to cost effectively address 'energy droughts'. In this article, we present a time sequential solver model of the NEM and an optimal firming technology plant mix to allow the system to be supplied by 100% VRE. Our conclusion is that some form of fuel-based technology (most likely hydrogen) will probably be required. This has important implications for Australian energy policy.",1
"In this paper, a residential appliance scheduling problem is addressed. Usually, the householders main attention is focused on reducing the amount of money put into the energy suppliers pocket without affecting the comfort level. The proposed model aims at scheduling the home appliances in such a way the cost and discomfort are reduced. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming in which the decision variables are the optimal starting time of the appliances. The model is simulated under a day-ahead electricity pricing for three cases: traditional user, smart user, and smart prosumer. Simulation results show that the proposed technique optimally schedules the appliances so that the electricity payments is reduced and the users comfort is increased.",0

"Land use, land-use change, and forestry (LULUCF) sector plays an important role in climate change mitigation as long-term goal of carbon neutral economy depends on sector's ability to sequestrate carbon in biomass and soil. With reference to the Paris Agreement, accounting rules for LULUCF sector have been heavily discussed in European Union (EU), seeking of trustworthy inclusion of the sector in the assessment of Union's greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduc-tion target. Therefore, the paper aims to analyze LULUCF sector's contribution to climate change mitigation with different accounting rules applied in EU countries and particularly in Lithuania. On EU level LULUCF sector's absorption in 2019 has equaled around -234 million t CO2 eq. (6% of total EU GHG emissions), in some countries reaching more than a half of national emissions. However, different accounting rules applied may provide significantly different number of potential credits for separate EU countries, creating some winners and losers situation. Though inclusion of LULUCF sector into GHG's emissions reduction targets remains discussible, some stability in rules is one of the main preconditions for proper LULUCF sector management decisions.",1
"The effects of climate change are multiple and fundamental. Decisions made today may result in irreversible damage to the planet's biodiversity and ecosystems, the detrimental impacts of which will be borne by today's children, young people and those yet unborn (future generations). The use of citizens' assemblies (CAs) to tackle the issue of climate change is growing. Their remit is future focused. Yet is the future in the room? Focusing on a single case study, the recent Irish CA and Joint Oireachtas Committee on Climate Action (JOCCA) deliberations on climate action, this paper explores the extent to which children, young people and future generations were included. Its systemic analysis of the membership of both institutions, the public submissions to them and the invited expertise presented, finds that the Irish CA was 'too tightly coupled' on this issue. This may have been beneficial in terms of impact, but it came at the expense of input legitimacy and potentially intergenerational justice. Referring to international developments, it suggests how these groups may be included through enclave deliberation, institutional innovations, design experiments and future-oriented practice. .",1

The hybrid system including a PIC 18F452 and a 18F2550 microcontroller has been tested on a 2.5 kW solar panel and a 2.5 kW wind turbine. It has been observed that this hybrid system works successfully and gives good performance such as low cost and easy programming.",0

"Global commitments for climate change mitigation and sustainable development have given the electric vehicle renewed attention as a critical building block of sustainable transport. However, the diffusion of electric vehicles has been limited so far. In an effort to facilitate scaled-up deployment of electric vehicles, this paper examines the economic feasibility of replacing the current fleet of fossil fuel taxis in Seoul with electric vehicle (EV) taxis by gradually phasing out the former based on their operational lifetime. In the cost-benefit analysis for such a transition, costs of purchasing vehicles and constructing and maintaining charging infrastructure are estimated based on the market prices and characteristics of taxi transport in Seoul. On the benefit side, the avoided environmental costs due to reduced air pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions are calculated. Traffic assignment is incorporated in the calculation process for a better estimation of the avoided costs through more accurate link flows and speeds on the road network. Savings in fuel and maintenance costs are also estimated. The resultant benefit-cost ratio signifies economic viability of the deployment of EV taxis. The results of the study are encouraging and could strengthen the argument for pushing the transition to electric vehicles forward.",1
"CO2 capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) technology provides an efficient alternative for decarbonizing the coal chemical industry under China's carbon neutrality goal. However, uncertainties such as geological conditions, technology level, carbon markets, subsidy policies, etc., will greatly affect investor confidence in the CCUS applicability in this industry. This study develops a trinomial tree real options based CCUS investment decision model to explore CCUS investment feasibilities for China's coal chemical enterprises with different CO2 geological sequestration and utilization approaches, i.e., CO2 enhanced oil recovery (CO2-EOR) projects, CO2 enhanced coalbed methane (CO2-ECBM) projects, and deep saline aquifer (DSA) projects. The findings show that 1) CO2-ECBM projects have a larger investment benefit compared to CO2-EOR and DSA projects, with a critical coalbed methane (CBM) price for the immediate investment of 1.3 CNY/m3 under the current technology and carbon price level. 2) CO2-EOR projects are immediately investable at a critical oil price of 200 CNY/BBL; DSA projects require the execution of a delayed option with a critical carbon price of 361.8 CNY/t. 3) Provincial investment benefits vary substantially depending on CO2 transport distance and product revenue, particularly for CO2-ECBM projects in Henan and Guizhou, which have significant investment benefits due to high local CBM prices and short CO2 transport distances.",1
"CO 2 management, capturing CO 2 from industry processes or removing CO 2 from the atmosphere, is increasingly presented as a necessity for climate. Scandinavian countries are at the forefront of developing carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology. We reviewed the scientific literature on CCS in Scandinavia to identify and analyse prevalent imaginaries for the role of this technology in the region. Imaginaries capture ideas about the future use of technologies. They are deeply political in that they help define what futures are seen as possible and desirable. Studying CCS imaginaries can grant insights into how current structures and interests shape future climate mitigation pathways. Our results show that one dominant imaginary defines the scientific debate, which envisions using CCS to preserve the industrial base of the region while seeking to meet climate goals. This dominant imaginary builds its appeal and legitimacy around three main characteristics: 1) scientific authority, which justifies the need for large-scale CCS, 2) greening the industrial regime, which gives it a specific purpose, and 3) Scandinavian exceptionalism, which mobilises existing infrastructure and regional know-how combined with a narrative of national environmental leadership. We argue that the dominant imaginary limits the way in which the future can be imagined, by framing out remaining uncertainties and alternative ways of lowering emissions. This highlights the importance of open and critical democratic debate about suggested mitigation pathways.",1
"Microalgae is capable of fixing CO2 and utilizing nutrients from wastewater through photosynthesis, making it the most promising biotechnology for carbon capture. Efficient carbon capture is crucial for both microalgae cultivation processes and biomass conversion. Micro-nano-bubbles (MNBs) have the potential to enhance the CO2 solubility and carbon capture efficiency of microalgae due to their minuscule size, high gas-liquid mass transfer efficiency, and large electrostatic interactions. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive reviews to elucidate the potential applications of MNBs in microalgae production. Therefore, this review will systematically introduce the unique properties of MNBs and suitable generation methods for microalgae cultivation. In addition, the insights mechanisms into how MNBs improve the gas-liquid mass transfer and carbon capture efficiency during microalgae cultivation are illustrated. Moreover, potential applications of MNBs in microalgae cultivation, such as the synergistic effects of MNBs in the pretreatment of wastewater and microalgae separation, are highlighted and discussed in depth. Finally, future research directions for MNBs-coupled microalgae systems are outlined. This review is organized to provide readers with an understanding of relevant topics to advance the application of MNBs in the microalgae cultivation industry as well as in upstream and downstream industries.",1
"This article introduces a new nonisolated soft-switching coupled-inductor (CI) step-up dc/dc converter. The presented topology utilizes a three-winding CI (TWCI) along with a voltage multiplier circuit to increase the voltage conversion ratio without needing a high duty cycle. Using this circuit, a high voltage gain can be achieved without requiring a large number of turns ratio in the CI. The input current ripple of the introduced converter is very low, which is very desirable for renewable energy sources applications. The TWCI also creates an additional design freedom to increase the voltage gain, which indicates more circuit flexibility. Additionally, the voltage stress across the single power switch is limited with the help of a regenerative clamp capacitor. The leakage inductor of the CI is used to create a resonant tank to reduce power losses further. The leakage inductances help provide the zero-current switching conditions for the single power switch and decrease the reverse-recovery issues for all diodes, leading to an efficiency improvement. The operation principle, steady-state analysis, and design considerations are discussed thoroughly. Finally, the theoretical analysis is validated through experimental results obtained from a 200 W prototype with 250 V output voltage.",0
"Numerous studies worldwide emphasize the impacts that cities now face due to increasing variability of weather extremes associated with climate change, exacerbating the urban heat island effect, air pollution and health impacts. In this respect, cities need to cope with these new threats and get prepared. One way of doing this is to develop climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies, focusing on local vulnerabilities in relation to the current societal development needs and adaptation options. There are many recent initiatives and examples for climate change adaptation strategies and plans for large cities, but only a few examples for small and medium-size cities. This paper investigates the mid-(2021-2050) and far-future (2071-2100) climate change signals in an urban area located in northern Romania (Baia Mare town), with around 200,000 inhabitants, exploring the results of some CORDEX GCMs under the new IPCC RCPs (RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). The study analyzes these signals in relation to the local awareness of key institutional stakeholders, as well as to the current social and economic constraints towards considering the climate change adaptation. The findings, based on a survey, highlight how the local authorities perceive and include climate change aspects in their activities as an important step towards real implementation of specific climate-based decisions, as well as their needs in terms of climate information and data. The study provides useful scientific insights about future climate and expected impacts in the Baia Mare Urban System to stakeholders, which could increase their awareness and knowledge in terms of climate change.",1
"Decision support tools for incentivizing environmentally sound decisions in building design, such as LCA (life cycle assessment), have been highlighted as an essential feature for enhancing the realization of more sustainable buildings. Nevertheless, the use of LCA to support decisions in building design is still limited in practice. A better understanding of the social dynamics and detailed contexts of the decisions leading up to a final building design is therefore critical for better integration of LCA-based information in the decision-making processes. This paper reports a qualitative, semi-structured interview study of single-family home producers in Sweden and their decision-making in relation to climate mitigation, with a particular focus on embodied carbon mitigation. By studying a specific branch of the building and construction sector, a more in-depth record can be obtained of the particularities of implementation contexts and decision-making situations in which LCA may, or may not, have a role in driving climate mitigation. Four primary decision contexts in which LCA may have an influential role to drive embodied carbon reduction include: (1) the development of building systems, (2) development and offering of house models, (3) the selection of construction products for the building system as well as for the offer of add-on products to customers, and (4) the dialogues in the individual house-buyer projects. Decision-making that affects sustainable outcomes in this part of the sector is very much dependent on a supporting regulatory context. Over the years, using building LCA in early design stages, for optimization towards low-impact final buildings, has been a repeatedly promoted recommendation both in academia and practice. This study, however, reveals that such a conclusion is too simplistic. The different overarching decision contexts identified for this particular branch display the variety of needs for life cycle-based information.",1
"The research aims were to construct an air-breathing paper-based microfluidic fuel cell (paper-based muFC) and to evaluated it with different soft drinks to provide energy for their prospective use in portable devices as an emergency power source. First, in a half-cell configuration, cyclic voltammetry showed that glucose, maltose, and fructose had specific oxidation zones in the presence of platinum-ruthenium on carbon (PtRu/C) when they were individual. Still, when they were mixed, glucose was observed to be oxidized to a greater extent than fructose and maltose. After, when a paper-based muFC was constructed, PtRu/C and platinum on carbon (Pt/C) were used as anode and cathode, the performance of this muFC was mostly influenced by the concentration of glucose present in each soft drink, obtaining maximum power densities at room temperature of 0.061, 0.063, 0.060, and 0.073 mW cm-2 for Coca Cola(R), Pepsi(R), Dr. Pepper(R), and 7up(R), respectively. Interestingly, when the soft drinks were cooled, the performance was increased up to 85%. Furthermore, a four-cell stack muFC was constructed to demonstrate its usefulness as a possible power supply, obtaining a power density of 0.4 mW cm-2, using Coca Cola(R) as fuel and air as oxidant. Together, the results of the present study indicate an alternative application of an muFC using soft drinks as a backup source of energy in emergencies.",0
"The United Nations (UN) has introduced 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) intending to achieve a conventional trio of social, economic, and environmental prosperity across the world. Pakistan is making a fair contribution to SDG achievement under its 'Vision 2025'. However, the introduced strategy for SDG implementation is a sectoral based approach which leads to severe resource inefficiency. The objective of this study is the development and implementation of a nexus strategy of SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), and SDG 13 (Climate Action) in Pakistan due to their indepth interlinkage and interdependence, to achieve sustainability in Energy, Water, and Environment. This study comprises an onfield Energy-Water-Sustainability assessment of 24 public sector premises across Punjab to create a pilot model for future implementation. The Pearson correlation analysis of the SDGs substantiates the argument of the nexus approach. The results of this work show the energy conservation potential of approximately 12.8 MW and renewable energy installation potential of 40.4 MW to achieve SDG 7. Moreover, rainwater harvesting is calculated to be 0.035 million cm3 per annum, contributing to approximately 7% reduction in water use to achieve SDG 6 and minimizing the environmental impact on cities by reducing 14.8 million tons of Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) per annum to achieve SDG 11 and 13. The results show that due to indepth interlinkage, the nexus implementation approach enhances the execution process while eliminating resource duplication to reduce inefficiency.",1
"Due to climate change threats, governments worldwide are taking measures to move towards cleaner technologies. One such alternative in the energy sector is Renewable Energy Technologies (RET). Due to its merit over conventional technology, RET is being promoted in the industry and households. However, residential consumers switching from incumbent technologies to RET is still low. To fill this gap, this study builds on the Push-PullMooring (PPM) framework to uncover the key factors affecting the switching intention of residential consumers toward RET. We adopted a sequential explanatory mixed-methods approach that involved a quantitative investigation followed by a qualitative study. In the quantitative phase, we used structural equation modeling techniques to analyze survey data from 291 participants to test our conceptual model. Subsequently, in the qualitative phase, in-depth interviews with 25 participants were conducted to gain deeper insights and validate the relationships identified in the quantitative analysis. The results indicate that environmental concern (push factor), economic benefit, and independence benefit (pull factor) have a positive association with switching intention. However, switching cost (mooring factor) was found to have a negative association with switching intention. Further, switching cost was also found to moderate the association between economic benefit and switching intention. The qualitative study provided further insights into the results of the quantitative investigation. It was clarified from the qualitative study that neighbor experiences and societal preferences of the causes may mitigate the influence of subjective norms on switching intention. Lastly, implications were drawn for academicians, marketers, and public policymakers. Marketers can utilize these findings to develop appropriate marketing strategies for this untapped market, which has huge potential.",1
"Regenerative agriculture, an alternative form of food and fiber production, concerns itself with enhancing and restoring resilient systems supported by functional ecosystem processes and healthy, organic soils capable of producing a full suite of ecosystem services, among them soil carbon sequestration and improved soil water retention. As such, climate change mitigation and adaptation are incidental to a larger enterprise that employs a systems approach to managing landscapes and communities. The transformative potential of regenerative agriculture has seen growing attention in the popular press, but few empirical studies have explored the processes by which farmers enter into, navigate, and, importantly, sustain the required paradigm shift in their approach to managing their properties, farm businesses, and personal lives. We draw on theories and insights associated with relational thinking to analyze the experiences of farmers in Australia who have undertaken and sustained transitions from conventional to regenerative agriculture. We present a conceptual framework of zones of friction and traction occurring in personal, practical, and political spheres of transformation that both challenge and facilitate the transition process. Our findings illustrate the ways in which deeply held values and emotions influence and interact with mental models, worldviews, and cultural norms as a result of regular monitoring; and how behavioral change is sustained through the establishment of self-amplifying positive feedbacks involving biophilic emotions, a sense of well-being, and an ever-expanding worldview. We conclude that transitioning to regenerative agriculture involves more than a suite of 'climate-smart' mitigation and adaptation practices supported by technical innovation, policy, education, and outreach. Rather, it involves subjective, nonmaterial factors associated with culture, values, ethics, identity, and emotion that operate at individual, household, and community scales and interact with regional, national and global processes. Findings have implications for strategies aimed at facilitating a large-scale transition to climate-smart regenerative agriculture.",1
"Understanding earthquakes and volcano eruptions phenomena require the analysis of large amounts of subsurface data. Currently, data collected from these events need post-processing in an off-line mode due to hardware limitations and strong bandwidth constraints. Furthermore, analytics may take days, even weeks, in being processed after collection. In some cases, underground structures require previous studies and subsurface knowledge from experts to establish certain input parameters. By leveraging current IoT technologies, we introduce an autonomous seismic imaging system (ASIS), a real-time system for monitoring and generating analytics of seismic data based on a sensor network. ASIS processes real-time analytics near where the events are generated (fog computing) to mitigate bandwidth limitations. Calculations for earthquake detection, location, and magnitude are processed in situ. ASIS allows monitoring sensor status, visualizing the data of each sensor, and generating two dimensional/three dimensional (2-D/3-D) subsurface structures. The system is able to learn the underground structure by taking advantage of ambient noise data analysis, which significantly reduces the need of initial parameters. We incorporated a renewable energy source to extend sensor functionality, and we made the system self-healing and fault-tolerant. Indoor and outdoor evaluation of the system showed the error of earthquake detection is 13.7 ms and the spatial location accuracy is 5.1 ft.",0
"Microgrids assisted by renewable energy resources are complex man made systems of various interconnected components. A number of real life scenarios relating to resource management in microgrids are modeled as multi-objective optimization formulations where multiple objectives may or may not conflict with each other. While considering the type of application, input and output of the problem, the nature of optimization problem changes. To address various types of optimization problems relating to microgid design, planning and operation, there exist a number of optimization solution types. We investigate the existing literature to classify different optimization objectives with respect to designing, planning and operation of microgrids. Some mathematical formulations for commonly used objectives relating to resource management in microgrids have been tabulated. We also classified the optimization types being used to address various optimization problems relating to resource management in microgrids. Various types of solution approaches along with the relevant simulation tools are also presented. We also reviewed the multicriteria optimization for different application areas of smart grid. The article can serve as a foundation for further research in the area of multicriteria decision making relating to resource management in micrgorids.",0
"The use of forest and agricultural residues for energy production presents multiple benefits, but the link between bioenergy and the environment is complex and not all of the energetic options have the same impacts. This work evaluates the net positive effect of valorizing residual biomass in the context of a rural area of Portugal, Estremoz. It focuses on the combined assessment of biomass availability, techno-economic feasibility and environmental aspects of utilizing forest and agricultural residues to produce bioheat. At first, the energy potential of the residual biomass available in the municipality is evaluated using a geographical information system database. The assessment with RETScreen of the techno-economic feasibility of replacing electricity by biomass for heating local public schools follows. The results show that around 27 314 t of residues, corresponding to about 267 680 GJ, are produced each year in Estremoz, more than half in montado areas. The use of this biomass for the replacement of the existing electric heating systems of nine local schools by biomass-based ones offers good project profitability. As far as the environment is concerned, the energetic valorization of the residual biomass in Estremoz has multiple benefits. It contributes to climate change mitigation by saving greenhouse gas emissions and promoting the preservation of the traditional extensive uses of the ecosystems. Moreover, a correct vegetation management decreases the fire risk, potentiates the increase in biodiversity, offers better conditions for native species and allows to maintain the ecosystems.

"It is vital for human's sustainable development to control global warming well below 2 degrees C compared to pre-industrial levels. In this paper, four scenarios, namely baseline (BAS) scenario, carbon capture and storage (CCS) scenario, high electricity consumption (HEC) scenario and renewable energy (REN) scenario, are developed to estimate the energy demand and carbon emission during 2020-2050 in transitional China. Furthermore, the health co-benefits of different pollutants reduction are further estimated. Our results show that the final energy demand of China will increase steadily in the BAS scenario, reaching approximately 5200 million tons of coal equivalents (tce) in 2050. While it is likely to peak around 3500 million tce in 2035 if industry and energy structure reform is actively implemented. The CO2 emissions will stabilize at 10 billion tons in the BAS scenario. The CCS, HIG and REN scenarios can all achieve the CO2 emission target in China with the constraints of temperature rising no more than 2 degrees C in 2030. Only the REN scenario, however, can achieve the 2 degrees C target in the medium term. Regarding health co-benefits, in 2050,102.67, 187.11 and 222.84 billion USD are gained in China under the CCS, HIG and REN scenarios, respectively, compared to the BAS scenario. Another important finding is that industry, electricity conversion and transportation sectors have the greatest health co-benefits in China, and NOx reduction plays a dominant role, which will reduce 291,000 mortality cases in the REN scenario in 2050.

"Policy makers, as well as many economists, recognize geological carbon capture and storage (CCS) as an option for avoiding costly emission reductions. While an extreme perspective is to envision CCS as a magic bullet to solve the issue of climate change, a more balanced economics perspective would situate this approach within a portfolio of mitigation actions. CCS can be implemented with two purposes: it can act as a substitute for other technological efforts to reach a given environmental target and it offers the potential for additional emission reductions to reach a 'safer' climate target. In order to balance these two possible ways of utilizing CCS and to assess their respective effects on early policy strategies, we have undertaken a twofold numerical experiment. First, a cost-efficiency analysis was undertaken, where the sole effect of CCS was substitution for other efforts. This was followed by a cost-benefit analysis where both purposes had to be balanced. We find that future availability of CCS is less of a reason to relax near-term abatement efforts than what could be inferred from previous analyses. Moreover, the cost-benefit analysis indicates that environmental targets should be more ambitious when CCS is included in the picture.",1
"The past decade has seen an increase in renewable energy sources in the energy mix due to global environmental and supply security concerns. This paper aimed to investigate renewable energy effects on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the Southern African Power Pool (SAPP). The investigation is from 1988 to 2018, using the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL), Nonlinear ARDL (NARDL), and fully modified OLS (FMOL) techniques. Based on empirical analyses of ARDL and FMOLS, it was found that both renewable and nonrenewable energies have a positive impact on economic growth in the Southern African power pool. However, the NARDL estimation indicates that neither renewable nor nonrenewable energy has a significant effect on economic growth in Southern African power pool. Therefore, based on the findings from both ARDL and FMOLS, the growth hypothesis is supported regarding the connection between renewable energy and economic growth in the Southern Africa power pool. Centered on the results, some policy implications were drawn for SAPP for sustainable economic growth, which includes measures to increase renewable energy in the energy mix, and also to encourage the optimization of cross-border connections where energy production from countries within SAPP that are not restricted by natural resources can be relied on to export sustainable energy. Additionally, building a more sustainable integrated power system in the region will assist SAPP with sustainable energy access and reduce the dependence on nonrenewable energy within the interconnected countries soon.",1
"The Cooperative Research Centre for Greenhouse Gas Technologies (CO2CRC) was setup with distinct programs focusing on storage, capture, demonstration, education and international collaboration designed to address the many issues facing potential carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects. In particular the Capture Program aims to research, develop and deploy technologies that can achieve significant cuts in capture cost (75-80%) and provide Australia with a research and education capability to support industries using these technologies. This paper provides details on the capture research activities within the centre, the major demonstration projects underway, including outlines of the equipment employed and how they are enabling the progression of separation technologies from laboratory through to eventual large scale commercial operation. Aided by recent initiatives of the Victorian State Government, under their Energy Technology Innovation Strategy (ETIS) program, CO2CRC is leading the research in two such research and development projects. These three year projects, one a $6 million post combustion demonstration incorporating a 10,000 tpa CO(2) capture plant, and the other a $5.5 million pre-combustion application, each designed to test the CO2CRC's full range of capture technologies (solvents, membranes and adsorption systems), in purpose built rigs under actual power plant conditions. The ability to demonstrate both conventional and novel capture techniques in the one facility is, we believe, unique. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",1
"In this article, we conceptualize technique effect from a carbon emission reduction perspective, informed by the work of MacDougall, Shahbaz, and Daron Acemoglu and others following them. Building on this, we classify these determinants of technique effect into two typologies. Foreign trade and foreign direct investment are defined as external channel. Research and development are defined as internal channel. We set up a two-way fixed effect model to illustrate how technique advancement effect on carbon emissions reduction through different channels. Considering the regional heterogeneity, human capital is added in the model as interaction term. By using the panel data of 30 regions in China during the period from 2005 to 2012, regression results indicate that foreign direct investment and expenditure of R&D significantly reduce carbon emissions in China, Technique effect of foreign trade on carbon emission reduction is not obvious. Techinque effect of foreign direct investment on carbon emission reduction has regional heterogeneity. Technique effect of FDI on carbon emission reduction also depends on the level of human capital. Wih the higher levels of human capital, the inhibitory effect of foreign direct investment on carbon emission is more significant.",1
"Climate Change is caused by greenhouse gases such as CO2. Worldwide increase in energy demand coupled with a continued reliance on fossil fuels have contributed to a significant increase in atmospheric levels of CO2. Scenarios for stabilizing the emissions of CO2 suggest mitigation actions including the deployment of Carbon Capture and Storage projects (CCS). One of the process steps consists in the transportation of the CO2 to a storage location by buried pipelines. Any accidental release determined by failures is followed by a pressurized release of CO2 with dry ice formation. Under specific conditions a dry ice bank will form contributing to atmospheric dispersion through superficial sublimation (Vianello et al., 2014). This study focuses on the importance of the bank sublimation emission to the near field dispersion of CO2. The application of CFD techniques show that hazardous conditions exist over an area close to the source. Within 50 m from the pipeline the volumetric fraction of CO2 still amounts to 7 - 10 % at 1.5 m above the ground, causing serious health effects on operators in a short time. In addition, a decrease in wind velocity coupled with an increase in both the ambient temperature and the intensity of solar radiation worsens the risk of health hazards. The danger persists for days after the accident given the slow dry ice bank sublimation process which becomes the dominant hazard source afterwards.",1
"In the context of Europe's efforts towards decarbonization, this paper introduces a novel framework for Renewable Energy Communities (RECs), validated with multiple case studies from Italy's practice. Drawing on established concepts and an extensive literature review, the framework identifies key pillars supporting its model. The paper delineates the essential features defining the conceptual model of RECs, offering a processoriented perspective. This model serves as a tool to assess the success of existing RECs comprehensively and provides a structured pathway for the development of new projects across different countries, fostering replication within communities. An overarching framework is presented as a solution to enhance the effective utilization of renewable energy sources. Buildings, and the communities of people who live in them are considered primary energy consumers and direct beneficiaries of a REC framework. Consequently, an original pathway for the mass renovation of buildings located in highly populated areas, from the energy sources perspective, is provided.",1
"DC-DC boost converters are necessary to extract power from solar panels. The output voltage from these panels is far lower than the utility voltage levels. One of the main functions of the boost converter is to provide a considerable step-up gain to interface the panel to the utility lines. There are several techniques used to boost the low panel voltage. Some of the issues faced by these topologies are a high duty ratio operation, complex design with multiple active switches and discontinuous input current that affects the power drawn from the panel. This paper presents a boost converter topology that combines the advantages of an interleaved structure, a voltage lift capacitor and a passive voltage multiplier network. A mathematical analysis of the proposed converter during its various modes of operation is presented. A 100 W prototype of the proposed converter is designed and tested. The prototype is controlled by a PIC16F18455 microcontroller. The converter is capable of achieving a gain of 10 without operating at extremely high duty ratios. The voltage stress of the switch is far lower than the maximum output voltage.",0
"This paper investigates the carbon emissions reduction problem in a two-echelon supply chain. The participants have their own greening technologies under the carbon trading scheme. We establish Nash game models to analyze the impact of the responsibility allocation of carbon emissions reduction on supply chain performance. We find that when the carbon price is lower than the upstream firm's unit cost of reducing emissions, only the downstream firm using greening technology is a better choice than both the upstream and downstream firms using greening technologies. Numerical analysis provides more insights for the managers in practice.",1
"Carbon tax is a policy instrument that facilitate the phase-out of coal as a chemical feedstock and help China achieve an early carbon peak. However, the policy design is challenged by the complex dynamics of global warming potentials (GWP) from upstream methane emissions, which have a short atmospheric lifetime but a high climate impact. In this study, we compared the life-cycle GWP of two propylene production routes in China: Coal-to-Olefin (CTO) and Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH). We also conducted a cost-profit analysis that incorporates the carbon tax, considering uncertainties in the dynamic radiative forcing of methane. We derived a range of optimal carbon tax rates that can enhance the economic competitiveness of low-carbon propylene routes PDH and discourage the expansion of coal-fed CTO propylene routes. Results show that, for the propylene sector in China, the carbon tax rate should be between 86 and 600 Chinese Yuan (CNY) or 12-84 US dollars (USD) per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e), which corresponds to 1-10% of the typical propylene price in the Chinese market. Our study provides spatiotemporal insights into the carbon tax for China's propylene sector to decarbonize and control upstream methane emissions. Since propylene is one of the key raw materials for chemical (e.g., plastic) productions, our analysis contributes to the climate benefits of global chemical trade.",1
"Following the renaissance of energy generation from renewable sources around the globe, it was suggested that the shift from fossil to renewable energy could potentially counter the growth orientation of economic activity. In this line of argument, small-scale technology and decentralised ownership, in the field of energy and beyond, are commonly regarded as potential precursors of a sustainable degrowth society. However, these systemic and conceptual considerations have been rarely assessed empirically. This paper wishes to address this research gap. It presents the exploratory findings of an EU-wide survey conducted in 2013 and further discusses the conceptualisation of small-scale ownership structures in renewable energy as an alternative to the community energy concept. Secondly, the paper relates the debates on degrowth to small-scale renewable energy schemes and illustrates its argument with four case studies from Wales, Italy, Spain, and Germany. These cases represent different organisational forms, diverse spatial settings, and varying national policy contexts. In its observations, this paper draws on the concept of collective and politically motivated renewable energy projects (CPE). While still mainly found in niches across Europe and essentially linked to environmental and social movements, we argue that CPE can potentially become blueprints for a turn towards a degrowth practice that will foster the democratisation of renewable energy production.",1
"Soil organic carbon (SOC) is central to the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems, has climate mitigation potential and provides several benefits for soil health. Understanding the spatial distribution of SOC can help formulate sustainable soil management practices. Digital soil mapping (DSM) uses advanced statistical and geostatistical methods to estimate soil properties across large areas. DSM integrates climate data, topographic features, geology, legacy soil maps, land management and remote sensing data. Bare soil spectra may reflect the presence of particular soil components, making satellite derived spectra suitable predictors of SOC. Bare soil spectra derived from Sentinel-2 were used to estimate SOC concentration (SOC%) and granulometric fractions in the plough layer (0-30 cm) of agricultural parcels in northern Belgium. Thereafter, the estimation performance of SOC% was compared for three DSM models: one with bare soil spectra, one with environmental covariates (topography, granulometry and vegetation), and a combined model with bare soil spectra and environmental covariates. The estimation performance of sand, silt and clay fractions using bare soil spectra from the spring seedbed (R2: 2 : 0.53-0.74; RPD: 1.49-2.05; RPIQ: 1.52-2.39) was higher than that of SOC% (R2: 2 : 0.16; RPD: 1.08; RPIQ: 1.32). The highest estimation performance of SOC% was obtained for a DSM model including all covariates (R2: 2 : 0.28; RPD: 1.18; RPIQ: 1.44), but the contribution of spring seedbed spectra to a model containing environmental covariates was small. The results provide valuable insights for refining soil property estimation using DSM with spectral and environmental covariates.",1
"Additional safety and lighting of pedestrian crossings using green energy can be reached by using specially designed device for forced reduction of vehicle speed. Device performs two functions: during the movement of the vehicle above the device, it generates electrical energy, as well as works like a normal speed limiter (a thick plate that is attached to the road surface to slow down the velocity of vehicles). This paper takes a new look at the term of sleeping policeman - an element forcibly reducing the speed of vehicles, one of the measures to calm the traffic, in our case before the pedestrian crossing. Sleeping policeman offered in the frame of current research offers possibility also to generate green energy for additional lightening of pedestrian crossings. Both functions together, will bring pedestrian crossing to the new level of safety.",1
"Electrical energy storage is often proposed as a solution for the mismatch between supply patterns of variable renewable electricity sources and electricity demand patterns. However, effectiveness and usefulness of storage may vary under different circumstances. This study provides an abstract perspective on the merits of electrical energy storage integrated with decentralized supply systems consisting of solar PV and wind power in a mesolevel, residential sector context. We used a balancing model to couple demand and supply patterns based on Dutch weather data and assess the resultant loads given various scenarios. Our model results highlight differences in storage effectiveness for solar PV and wind power, and strong diminishing-returns effects. Small storage capacities can be functional in reducing surpluses in overdimensioned supply systems and shortages in under-dimensioned supply systems. However, full elimination of imbalance requires substantial storage capacities. The overall potential of storage to mitigate imbalance of variable renewable energy is limited. Integration of storage in local supply systems may have self-sufficiency and cost-effectiveness benefits for prosumers but may have additional peak load disadvantages for grid operators. Adequate policy measures beyond current curtailment strategies are required to ensure proper distribution of benefits and responsibilities associated with variable renewable energy and storage.",1
"The effect of changes in roundwood harvests in Norway on the harvests in rest of the world is examined using a global forest sector model. About 60-100% of the harvest change in Norway is offset by an opposite change in the rest of the world. Such leakage rates vary over time, wood category, background scenario, and the size of the harvest change. Asymmetries between the effects of increasing and decreasing the harvests also exist. Hence, the magnitude of leakage rate is case specific, though considerable. Under tightening wood supply there is less need/room to respond to harvest increase/decrease in Norway with incremental/reduced harvests elsewhere. When the use of global forest resources intensifies with increasing wood demand in the future, leakage rates can be smaller than today. It is important to account for harvest leakage in order to avoid overestimating the climate benefits of policies that decrease or increase roundwood harvests. For instance, for full carbon sequestration benefits of increasing harvests for harvested wood products, creating fresh additional demand for these products should be prioritized. Else the origin of raw material and the place of production for these products may change instead of their stock.",1
"This paper analyses the role that AFOLU (agriculture, forest and other land use) plays in national deep decarbonization scenarios in Brazil, India and Indonesia between 2020 and 2050. It finds that the LULUCF (land use, land use change and forestry) subsector is important for medium-term mitigation (2020-2030) while continuing to contribute to mitigation over the long-term (2030-2050) in the three countries. Mitigation actions in LULUCF include drastically reducing deforestation (Brazil, Indonesia) and peat degradation (Indonesia), re-/afforestation (all), increased sequestration in standing forests (Brazil, Indonesia) and increasing soil carbon in agricultural lands (India). AFOLU further contributes to mitigation in Brazil and Indonesia by producing biomass feedstock for bioenergy. No country significantly reduces N2O and CH4 emissions from either agriculture or via demand-side actions on diets, due to trade-offs with food security, rural livelihoods and economic growth (although all countries reduce the GHG intensity of agricultural products). Furthermore, the paper analyses national policies to manoeuvre co-benefits and trade-offs between mitigation and other sustainable development goals (SDGs), including no poverty (1); zero hunger (2); decent work and economic growth (8); climate action, including both adaptation and mitigation (13); and life on land (15). Common policy areas were identified, including incentives to land managers for conservation or more environmental agricultural practices; changing regulations of land use to protect ecosystems and/or encourage shifts in agricultural practices; and strengthening enforcement capacity of land protection.",1
This chapter presents an analysis of how the new Russian support policy for renewable energy investments changes the expected profitability of renewable energy investments in Russia. A comparative analysis of investment profitability in the before and after support policy cases is presented for a wind farm investment to illustrate the effect of the policy.

"Now more than ever, renewable energy technologies have become a key player in improving accessibility to energy on the African continent. Focusing on the developing nation of South Africa, published works have indicated approximately thirteen criteria for selecting renewable energy technologies. Consideration was given to developed criteria and how they were used from technical, economic, social, environmental and political stances. The aid of analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and an established decision-model the author endeavored to substantiate a method of selecting appropriate technologies. These technologies were ranked in order of priority using South African energy projects. Case study information for onshore wind, solar photo-voltaic, concentrated solar thermal, biomass and small hydro energy alternatives were used to apply the decision-model for their ranking and prioritizing. The overall outcome of the decision-model identified that solar energy is the most suitable for South Africa and should be developed for long-term policy and energy roadmaps.",1
"The ocean is a key facet of climate stability and Earth's carbon cycle. Given the immense scale of atmospheric carbon dioxide removal (CDR) necessary to achieve international climate goals, ocean-based CDR approaches (or ocean CDR) warrant serious consideration. Ocean CDR is a still nascent, but cautiously promising, area of scientific research with several approaches under evaluation. Here, we examine one of the most promising approaches, ocean alkalinity enhancement, to highlight and exemplify challenges and opportunities of an emerging ocean CDR industry in the blue economy.",1
"Conservation of endangered, cold-stenothermic species, such as the freshwater pearl mussel (FPM) and its salmonid host fish, are particularly challenging in headwater streams as their last refuge areas. Understanding the impact of anthropogenic catchment features such as fish ponds on the hydrology and the temperature regime of such streams is, therefore, important. In this study, runoff in a FPM catchment with more than 150 small ponds was simulated using SWAT and compared to a scenario without ponds. Additionally, water temperature was monitored hourly along three steams over 2.5 years, at sites upstream and downstream of the inflow of pond outlet channels. Temperature metrics were related to land use within a 180 m corridor along the streams. Peak flows were reduced by 1.5% with ponds, while low flows were increased by 4.5%. In summer, temperature in pond effluents was higher than in the receiving stream, depending on the proximity of the inflow points. Discharge from close-by ponds increased summer stream temperature directly downstream of the inflow by up to 5.5 degrees C. These increased temperatures were partly compensated by groundwater contribution in forested areas. In contrast, stream temperature significantly further increased along stretches flowing through open land, persisting independently of pond inflows. We suggest incorporating this knowledge on pond- and land use-dependent effects on stream temperature regimes into the conservation management of FPM and other cold-stenothermic species, as well as into climate change mitigation strategies targeting an increased resilience against temperature extremes.",1

"Western European economies are among the top innovative countries in the globe and show a remarkable commitment to environmental sustainability through innovations and renewable energy targets. Particularly, renewable energy transition (RET) may shift Western European economies from unclean to clean energy sources and could reduce pollution. Therefore, we analyze the impact of RET and patents on CO2 emissions in 25 Western Europe countries using a period 1995-2020 and cross-sectional dependence techniques. Moreover, the impact of economic growth is also analyzed to examine the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC). The results suggest the presence of EKC with a turning point at GDP per capita of 50,287 dollars and Denmark, Iceland, Sweden, Ireland, Norway, Luxembourg, and Switzerland are found at the second stage of the EKC in the long run. Moreover, RET reduces CO2 emissions in the long and short run, Thus, RET helps to achieve environmental sustainability by reducing CO2 emissions in Western European economies. However, patents have negative effects in the long run but do not affect emissions in the short run. Thus, innovation helps to sustain an environment in the long run.",1
"Intense anthropogenic air, water, and soil pollution motivates researchers and this study to analyze the de-terminants of pollution and propose solutions to ensure environmental sustainability. By using the load capacity factor to examine the factors that determine environmental quality and by proposing the load capability curve (LCC) hypothesis, this study adds to the existing environmental literature. The load capacity factor allows for comprehensive environmental quality monitoring of environmental quality by comparing ecological footprint and biocapacity. This study evaluates the load capacity factor in relation to information and communication technology (ICT), research and development (R&D), renewable energy consumption, and income. In doing so, the study applies the cross-sectionally augmented autoregressive distributed lag estimator and the Durbin-Haussman cointegration test from 1986 to 2017 for the G7 countries. The empirical results show that renew-able energy, R&D spending, and ICT positively affect environmental quality. Moreover, since there is a U-shaped relationship between environmental quality and income, this study confirms the LCC hypothesis, implying that income initially deteriorates ecological conditions but helps improve environmental quality after crossing a certain threshold. The bottom turning point is around US$ 46660-47909, where G7 countries such as Canada, Germany, Japan, and the United States have reached income levels that improve load capacity factor. Based on the overall results, G7 governments should promote economic development, disseminate renewable energy, direct R&D spending to areas of greatest benefit, and support the deployment of green ICT infrastructure as part of their environmental policies.",1
"Fault analysis plays an important role in determining the location of potential CO2 storage sites in which long-term storage feasibility is critical. The presence of faults and fracture zones can potentially lead to the gradual migration of CO2 from the storage reservoir to the atmosphere through the overburden strata. Traditional methods such as manual picking of faults are time-consuming and labor-intensive tasks, which can be costly for the CO2 storage site assessment process. To help address this concern, we develop a process for automating fault picking using deep neural networks. We implement two different deep neural networks based on the architectures of UNet and Deeplab v3+. We train the networks using synthetic data and labels and augment them using linear transformations and elastic deformations. We implement an ensemble-based approach to improve the generalization ability of our method. We also incorporate uncertainty estimation into the framework to aid in the risk management aspect of the decision-making process. We use data sets from different regions across the globe which help us to improve the methodology, with the ultimate aim to help 3D fault detection in the Smeaheia Field, a potential site for CO2 storage scale-up on the Horda Platform, offshore Norway.",1
"After many years at the forefront of renewable energy (RE) implementation both in Europe and worldwide, Spain experienced a sudden transformation in 2012 to its RE development model in which national government backing and financial incentives for renewables were removed, throwing the RE sector into a paralysis which continues to the present day. This is in marked contrast to the case of the other major European RE leader, Germany, where it has been argued that RE implementation has produced a regime shift that has transformed the energy generation model to a new resilient pathway. In this paper, key differences between Spanish regions are identified in the way the RE implementation process has been carried out. The research brings these different characteristics into focus and analyses the strengths and weaknesses of the RE implementation process in each region. If stakeholders at all levels are empowered and motivated towards the implementation process goal, it is less likely that a few, very powerful actors (e.g. multinational energy companies or governments) can dominate the process, and thus systemic instability can be reduced. In this way, lock-down situations like the current one can be avoided in future and a more resilient system can be designed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",1
"For climate change mitigation, China launched seven pilot areas before establishing a unified carbon emission trading system in 2014. This study explores the weak version of the Porter hypothesis while focusing on listed companies in 31 provinces (municipalities or autonomous regions) from 1990 to 2018. In this study, we provided preliminary evidence on the influence of China's carbon emission trading scheme pilot policy on green innovation based on green patent data. Results show that the weak Porter hypothesis has not been realized in the current carbon trading market of China. Moreover, the pilot policy has significantly decreased the proportion of green patents by approximately 9.26%. Then, we find that the pilot policy has an evident lagging effect on restraining the green innovation of enterprises. Furthermore, inhibition is more pronounced among the samples of small-scale, manufacturing, and non-state-owned companies, including companies in the eastern and central regions. Most importantly, companies mainly choose to reduce output rather than increase green technological innovation to achieve their emission reduction targets. Moreover, companies reduce their investment in research and development because of the reduction in cash flow and expected income, which is not conducive to green innovation.",1
"Many countries have committed to reducing carbon emissions based on an international roadmap entitled carbon neutrality. This study empirically investigates the effects of green finance and renewable energy sources on 38 OECD member states' carbon neutrality target covering period from 2013 to 2021. According to the estimated findings, increasing the issued green bonds in OECD would bring about more achievements in the carbon neutrality target. In particular, A rise in green energy consumption of 1% is expected to result in an improvement of nearly 0.048% towards the carbon neutrality goal. Moreover, uncertainty has a negative impacts on the carbon neutrality of OECD with the most significant magnitude of coefficient among other explanatory variables. The primary policy implications are developing the green financial market, digital green financing tools, and sustainable power generation through three phases of locating, investing, and utilizing carbon market policy.",1
"This paper studies the low-carbon production problem based on an uncertain differential game. In a two-stage low-carbon product supply chain consisting of a single supplier and a single manufacturer, we construct an uncertain differential equation by taking the emission reduction efforts of the supplier and manufacturer as decision variables and product emission reduction as a state variable. Based on the uncertain differential game, we obtain the supply chain's dynamic equilibrium strategy, emission reduction, and revenue trajectory under non-cooperative and cooperative situations. By comparison, cooperation leads to more effort on both sides of the supply chain, more carbon emission reduction, and higher profits than non-cooperative ones. To further illustrate the supply chain game in the cooperative situation, we give different income situations under the two distribution methods of Nash bargaining solution and Shapley value, respectively.",1
"The Paris Agreement to keep global temperature increase to well-below 2 degrees C and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees C requires to formulate ambitious climate-change mitigation scenarios to reduce CO2 emissions and to enhance carbon sequestration. These scenarios likely require significant land-use change. Failing to mitigate climate change will result in an unprecedented warming with significant biodiversity loss. The mitigation potential on land is high. However, how land-based mitigation options potentially affect biodiversity is poorly understood. Some land-based mitigation options could also counter the biodiversity loss. Here we reviewed the recently scientific literature to assess twenty land-based mitigation options that are implemented in different mitigation pathways to comply with the Paris Agreement for their biodiversity impacts by using the Mean Species Abundance (MSA(LU)) indicator for land use. We showed the likely land-use transition and potential MSA(LU) changes for each option, compared their carbon sequestration opportunities (tC per ha) and assessed the resulting biodiversity change in two case scenarios. Our results showed that most options benefit biodiversity. Reforestation of cultivated and managed areas together with restoration of wetlands deliver the largest MSA(LU) increases, if land is allowed to reach a mature state over time. A quarter of the assessed options, including intensification of agricultural areas and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, decreased MSA(LU). Options, such as afforestation and reduced deforestation, either positively or negatively affected MSA(LU). This depends on their local implementation and adopted forest-conservation schemes. Comparing the different options showed that avoiding deforestation by implementing agroforestry at the expense of pastures delivered both the largest MSA(LU) increases and the highest carbon sequestration opportunities. However, agroforestry that leads to deforestation, enhanced carbon sequestration slightly but with a marginal MSA(LU) increase. This stresses the importance of avoiding forest conversion. Our study advances the understanding on current and future benefits and adverse effects of land-based mitigation options on biodiversity. This certainly helps biodiversity conservation and determines the regions with large land-based mitigation potential.",1
"Redox flow batteries using synthetically tunable and resource abundant organic molecules have gained increasing attention for large-scale energy storage. Herein we report a sulfonate-functionalized viologen molecule, 1,1'-bis(3-sulfonatopropyl)-4,4'-bipyridinium, (SPr)(2)V, as an anolyte in neutral aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) functioning through a cation charge transfer mechanism. Demonstrated (SPr)(2)V/KI AORFBs manifested high current performance from 40 to 100 mA/cm(2) with up to 71% energy efficiency. In extended cycling studies, the (SPr)(2)V/KI redox flow battery delivered stable cycling performance at 60 mA/cm(2), up to 67% energy efficiency, and 99.99% capacity retention per cycle. Density functional theory modeling of the electrostatic charge surface of (SPr)(2)V and its charged state, [(SPr)(2)V](-1), suggests charge repulsion and size exclusion enable their compatibility with a cation exchange membrane.

"Sustainable development has become the foremost requirement for sustainable economic conditions all around the globe, and this aspect demands new literature and regulators' emphasis. Hence, the present research investigates the impact of clean energy technologies, human development, health policies, green education, and ecotourism policy on sustainable development in China from 1991 to 2021. The researchers investigate the association among the variables using dynamic autoregressive distributed lag (DARDL). The outcomes revealed that clean energy technologies, human development, health policies, green education, and ecotourism policy have positive linkages with sustainable development in China. The article provides guidelines to the policymakers in developing policies related to attain sustainable development using effective clean energy technologies, human development, health policies, green education, and ecotourism policy.",1
"Carbon (dioxide) capture and storage (CCS) is one of the solutions for decarbonising society whereby CO2 is captured, transported, and injected into geological formations. It can be transported to offshore locations through pipelines or ships. Which method provides for a better deal for investors depends to an extent on the financial risk associated with these two methods, which in turn is linked with exposure to liability. This paper compares the potential liability arising from the carriage of CO2 by ships and by pipelines in the UK offshore context. The two modes of transport are governed by significantly different regimes, even though they concern the same material. It is argued that the transport of CO2 by ships and by pipelines poses similar risks and therefore they should have a similar liability regime. This would afford pipeline operators the economic advantages available to shipowners and incentivise investment in the transport phase of CCS.",1
"As the cut-in point of research on control and power electronics technology used in renewable energy, this paper does not aim to analyze particular theories or technologies in this field, but, instead, is to go back to the fountainhead of the issue to illustrate the essential concepts in this field, which are usually neglected and may become bottle-neck of the research. Research experiences have shown that confusion and trouble may be created if researchers do not understand these essential concepts well.",0
"Tropical forests have been focused for mitigating climate change impact through carbon sequestration in plant biomass under clean development mechanism (CDM). Since trees represent more than 98% of the above ground plant biomass, variation in tree growth rate drives carbon dynamics in tropical forests. By using tree-ring analysis, trait-based measurements, and field observations, we aimed at understanding the drivers of growth rate variation in four South Asian tropical moist forest tree species varying in plant functional types. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that mainly demographic and wood traits represented the first axis explaining 37% of the variance, whereas the second axis was represented by the leaf traits. Stem growth rate (DI) showed a nonlinear negative relation with competition index (CI) and the ratio of crown surface area to basal area (CBR) in three out of four tree species (p < 0.001) except Lagerstroemia speciosa which showed no significant relationship with any of the studied variables. DI was linearly positively related with light interception index (LI) and the ratio of sapwood area to heartwood area (SHR) in the shade intolerant Magnolia champaca and Toona ciliata (p < 0.001). Sap wood area (SA) had a strong positive effect on DI in the three species (p < 0.001). Taking tree size as a random factor and thus accounting for ontogenetic effects on tree growth, linear mixed effect modelling revealed that CI, SA and SHR are the best predictors of DI in M. champaca (AIC = 25.81, R-m(2) = 0.81) and T. ciliata (AIC = 62.95, R-m(2) = 0.61). In C. tabularis, CI, SA and CBR included in the best model predicting DI (AIC = 94.62, R-m(2) = 0.55). Variance partitioning analysis showed that the highest pure effect was observed in C. tabularis contributed by CI (12%), while the highest joint effect was found in M. champaca contributed by CI, SA and SHR (40%). Our analyses suggest that competition by neighbouring trees especially for soil moisture and the amount of active xylem portion are the main drivers of tree growth in moist tropical forests. Since tree growth rates regulate forest carbon dynamics, the insights into the growth drivers of the four selected species revealed by the study have important implications for forest/plantation management with a focus on carbon storage under CDM.",1
"As the world grapples with the dual challenge of fostering sustainable economic growth and achieving carbon neutrality, the role of renewable energy, urbanization, and financial development in shaping environmental outcomes in South Asian nations becomes increasingly critical. In this pioneering study, we delve into the heart of South Asia, encompassing a diverse range of nations - Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, the Maldives, and India - each chosen for their strategic geographical significance and the rich availability of pertinent data, offering a unique lens into the region's energy and economic dynamics. This research uses panel quantile regression analysis to examine the relationship between the renewable energy consumption, broad money, urbanization, and natural resources and their effects on carbon emissions and economic development in South Asian (SAARC) nations. Fixed-effect panel quantile regression analysis was used to adjust for geographical variability. This study aims to investigate how urbanization, broad money, natural resources, and renewable energy affect economic growth and carbon emissions. According to our research, renewable energy consumption significantly and negatively affects CO2 emissions, especially in the distribution's higher quantiles. Urbanization has a positive and significant effect on GDP, whereas natural resource rent has a positive impact on GDP and CO2 emissions. Broad money boosts GDP in the lower quantiles while having a negative impact in the higher quantiles. These findings show that in order to combine economic development with environmental sustainability, governments must concentrate on boosting the use of renewable energy sources and encouraging sustainable urbanization. Our policy implication is that policymakers should prioritize policies aimed at promoting renewable energy consumption and sustainable urbanization, which can help mitigate the negative environmental impact of economic growth in the SAARC region.",1
"Nature-based solutions inherently require a multifaceted perspective that encompasses diverse fields. The aim of this project is to develop more effective nature-based solutions, climate action and environmental awareness by breaking down boundaries between disciplines and fostering a co-creative process. Concepts of ecology and urban forestry were combined with the research on political ecology, environmental humanities, land art, regenerative art, performing art, participatory art, and more-than-human art. This process resulted in the creation of Aula Verde Aniene. It is located in an urban park in Rome and consists of a stand of trees arranged in circles with a specific design to give the perception of being in an outdoor vegetated room. The project activities involved community participation through art performances and citizen science initiatives. Regulating and cultural ecosystem services of Aula Verde were assessed using i-Tree Eco software and citizens' surveys. Beyond numerical descriptions of ecosystem services, the manuscript introduces shinrin-yoku as a practice to raise awareness of nature. The distinctive approach here described contributed to convey a sense of belonging to the ecosystem to citizens. The project framework and study findings have been developed to formulate policy recommendations and disseminate a format that can be adapted to diverse locations.",1
"In this paper the concept of eco-maintenance is presented. The concept aims to improve lifetime while minimising environmental impact over the entire life cycle to ensure maximum performance. Offshore wind farms are subjected to severe weather conditions, which limits the vessels capabilities to access the wind farms. The interest of this paper is the investigation of the optimal maintenance strategy for different offshore wind farms. This objective is achieved by implementing a simulation model which includes, weather and failure analysis as well as operation and maintenance. This paper shows how different maintenance strategies can influence the environmental performance of a wind farm.",1
"A computational model of pyrolysis of cotton fabric wastes used for bio-energy source is presented. The model describes thermal and oxidative degradation of cotton fabric under the oxygen-containing atmosphere and considers pseudo bi-component separate-stage kinetic process. Both exothermic and endothermic reactions are included in the decomposition process. At present, gas phase oxidation reactions are not included. Comparison with experimental results demonstrates that the predictions of the mass loss rate and temperature profile with these cotton fabrics are in agreement with the experiment. Effects of thermal radiation and ambient oxygen concentration on decomposition have also been investigated.",1
"This paper provides first empirical evidence on the effect of geopolitical risks in fossil fuel supplier countries on renewable energy diffusion in fossil fuel importing countries and the mediating roles of rising electricity prices and high import dependence. For this end, aggregate measures of geopolitical risk that countries are exposed to through fossil fuel imports are determined. This is done by combining detailed data on bilateral trade patterns for coal, oil, and natural gas of 37 countries in Europe with that on geopolitical risks in supplier countries. Using an instrumental variable approach, the study reveals that geopolitical risks in supplier countries tended to foster renewable energy diffusion in Europe during the period 1991-2021. The effects are especially pronounced for geopolitical risks related to coal and natural gas imports, while the importance of risks related to particular fossil fuels differed for the build-up of the individual renewable energies, i.e. wind, solar, and biomass. Rising elec-tricity prices and high import dependence, particularly for coal, partially amplified the effects on renewable energy diffusion. Despite the high import dependence, natural gas appears to have played in part a role as a bridging technology for energy transition.",1
"This article investigates the dynamic impact of green energy consumption (GE), financial inclusion (FI), and military spending (MS) on environmental sustainability (ES) by utilizing a sample of 121 countries from 2003 to 2022. The dataset is divided into high-income, upper-middle income and low and lower-middle-income countries. We employed a two-step system GMM approach, which was further robust through panel Quantile and Driscoll-Kraay (D-K) regressions. The findings divulged that green energy resources benefit ES at global and all income levels because of having a significant negative impact of 5.9% on ecological footprints. At the same time, FI and MS significantly enhance ecological footprints by 7% and 6.9%, respectively, proving these factors detrimental to ES. Moreover, conflicts (CON), terrorism (TM), institutional quality (IQ), and socioeconomic conditions (SEC) also have a significantly positive association with global ecological footprints and most of the income level groups. Dissimilarly, financial inclusion and armed conflicts have a non-significant influence on ecological footprints in low-income and high-income countries, respectively. Furthermore, institutional quality enhances ES in upper-middle and low and lower-middle-income countries by negatively affecting ecological footprints. At the same time, terrorism significantly reduces ecological footprints in high-income countries. This research also provides the imperative policy inferences to accomplish various SDGs.",1
"For MENA countries, transitioning to renewables primarily depends on transnational challenges of financial and infrastructural nature that cannot be tackled at national level. New renewable energy cooperation structures with the MENA were recently established in an attempt to manage interdependence problems. Drawing on a case study of renewable energy policy and markets in the MENA, this article aims at assessing the actual capacity of emerging cooperation structures to thoroughly manage the governance gap behind the transition to renewable energy technologies across the MENA. This article argues that politics have prevailed over policy, with concrete negative implications in terms of renewable energy finance towards the MENA. It concludes that far more synergic governance structures are needed to overcome the many (non-political) barriers that still hinder the take-up of renewables across the MENA. (C) 2015 The Authors.

"This paper aims at discussing the renewable energy potentials in delivering parts of the energy needs in Cameroon. The country has an enormous renewable energy potential. The lack of clear renewable energy policy in the mix is an issue that needs to be addressed urgently by-the Cameroonian government policy makers. The absence of commitment and enthusiasm from the government is weakening the sector potentiality to be developed either by private sector investments and also foreign investors.

"Due to the growing energy needs along with increasing concerns towards control of greenhouse gas emissions, most developing countries are under pressure to find alternative methods for energy conversion and policies to make these technologies economically viable. One of the instruments that have been adopted by many industrial countries is that of the carbon tax. The rate of introducing carbon taxes however, depends upon the local economic conditions and market forces. The case of Indian power sector has been examined by using MARKAL model for introduction of carbon taxes at four different trajectories. Their implications on the power generation choices have been investigated for a time span of 25 years from the year 2000. In general large hydropower plants have emerged as the first choice followed by wind energy systems. However, cheaper availability of coal in India keeps scope of use of coal based technologies for which pressurised fluidised bed combustion technology has been found to be the balanced choice among fossil technologies. There exists a potential of reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by about 25% as compared to the 'business-asusual' case in presence of high carbon tax rates. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

"Purpose Soil moisture is the main factor limiting the growth of vegetation in semiarid areas. A large area of the Loess Plateau has undergone vegetation restoration efforts following an afforestation program initiated in 1999. Understanding how soil moisture responded to afforestation is important for long-term sustainability of ecological restoration measures in this area, especially because the tree planted were non-native species. Methods The effects on soil moisture content (SMC) of afforestation (Robinia pseudoacacia and Caragana korshinskii) were measured for different plantation ages (10, 20, 30, and 40 years) on the Loess Plateau. Meanwhile, a comparative with natural restoration grassland for the same age intervals was conducted. Results SMC of R. pseudoacacia plots on south-facing slopes and R. pseudoacacia and C. korshinskii plots on north-facing slopes was lowest when vegetation coverage was greatest after 20 and 30 years, respectively; SMC increases over time following natural grassland restoration; soil moisture consumption of all vegetation types was greater in the shallow soil layer (20-200 cm) than in the deep soil layer (200-500 cm) in each recovery period; and based on a three-way ANOVA, the interaction among afforestation year, vegetation type, and soil depth had significant effects on SMC. Conclusion In response to societal demand for wood, existing plantations should be thinned, with afforested lands located on north-facing slopes being thinned every 10-30 years (approximately 20 years).",1
"One of the research areas related to renewable energy sources is the search for new applications for currently used technologies. An important postulate is to achieve the synergy effect by including the existing infrastructure in this process. The innovation described in this article is the integration of solar cells into a modular sound barrier on the highway. The contribution of this article is mainly based on the introduction of the potential feasibility of the first Turkish solar highway, describing the installation of PV systems based on a multi-criteria evaluation (azimuth angle, loss of shade, and dirt). The aim of the study is to determine the economic dimension by examining the costs of implementing such an investment and answering the question concerning the efficiency of solar cells on sound barriers. The research took into account various scenarios regarding the shadow effect and inclination of solar panels and their impact on solar energy production in the example of a given case study, an identified urban area. The research is limited to the model for assessing the feasibility of solar cells on sound barriers based on NPV and the essence of the relationship regarding the LCOE averaged electricity costs. In this study, the function and technical parameters of solar cells are not specified, but the article is limited to the basic information and characteristics required to investigate the payback period and profitability of an investment. Research has shown that if the investment is carried out in accordance with the proposed model, the expected amount of energy produced is 62,257 kWh per year. This value corresponds to the average consumption of electricity in a household by 24 apartments for a given destination, or to providing energy for a selected electric vehicle for one year of its operation, at the same time leading to a significant reduction of CO2. The presented research can find practical application in the area of developing a strategy for the development and popularization of renewable energy sources while increasing the use of the existing road infrastructure, presenting an important postulate in promoting this type of solution for other geographic destinations.",1
"Many countries and regions have set their schedules to achieve the carbon neutrality between 2030 and 2070. Microalgae are capable of efficiently fixing CO2 and simultaneously producing biomass for multiple applications, which is considered one of the most promising pathways for carbon capture and utilization. This work reviews the current research on microalgae CO2 fixation technologies and the challenges faced by the related industries and government agencies. The technoeconomic analysis indicates that cultivation is the major cost factor. Use of waste resources such as wastewater and flue gas can significantly reduce the costs and carbon footprints. The life cycle assessment has identified fossil-based electricity use as the major contributor to the global warming potential of microalgae-based CO2 fixation approach. Substantial efforts and investments are needed to identify and bridge the gaps among the microalgae strain development, cultivation conditions and systems, and use of renewable resources and energy.",1
"Cities in China will be crucial for deciding the direction of China's transition to a low-carbon economy and will play a key role in China's sustainable future. Over the next two decades over 325 million people will migrate to China's cities and by 2030 they are expected to house about 1 billion people. Will these cities be able to 'leapfrog' conventional high-carbon development? Many cities in China have put forward low-carbon city development plans and China's National Development and Reform Commission has designated five provinces and eight cities as low-carbon development zones. The challenge will be on-the-ground implementation of these low-carbon development plans based on sound indicator systems for monitoring and evaluation of emission reductions. The paper analyses one key sector for urban development issues in Chinese cities, namely the application and use of renewable electricity technologies in cities as a crucial element of low-carbon city development. Several city case studies are presented which show that flexibility at the local level has allowed several cities in China to adopt and implement support policies and targets for renewable energy technologies such as solar PV and geothermal heat pumps. Through the application of solar water heating technologies, in particular, significant progress has been achieved, resulting in electricity savings in the building sector. The analysis concludes with an assessment of how these ongoing initiatives in Chinese cities may contribute to leapfrogging in urban environmental outcomes, particularly in terms of urban carbon emissions.

As a case study, the design and performance of a grid connected photovoltaic system with battery backup storage are investigated. This test system is perfectly suitable for smart applications in the modern power systems. The soft switching (zero voltage switching (ZVS)) capability operates over a wide operating range, without the requirement of auxiliary circuits. This is seen as the main advantage of the presented method for controlling the DC/DC converter. A centralised control strategy, including maximum power point tracking, power flow management and interfacing with the utility are evaluated.

"Utilization of alternate energy resources is one of the new paradigms proposed in today's world to overcome the shortfall of conventional methods like nuclear, hydro and geothermal sources used in developing countries such as Pakistan. Using wind, solar power, wave power, tidal power and clean green energy has now become more popular. Harnessing wind energy', the country can produce up to 346,000 MW in the coastal areas; solar is an efficient option but has a major downfall in that it is quite costly to implement currently on a large scale. Incredible amount of energy' can be produced from waves but again, strong, expensive equipment has to be installed. In this paper, we propose producing green energy from microcellular organisms known as algae as a highly effective alternate energy generating mechanism, with significantly fewer disadvantages compared to traditional renewable resources. We designed a system that produces energy from algae biofuel on a small scale using artificial illumination to enhance growth yield of the algae making the process significantly cost effective. On a large scale bio-reactors and a paddle wheel are currently in use, requiring additional area. Comparison with various oil producing crops such as palm, coconut, jatropha oil etc shows that only algae can produce from 5000-20,000 gallons of oil per acre in a year. Experimental results show that for three 250ml water bottles producing 56 moles of algae, and average power output of 50kW can obtained translating into a average yield of 89%.",1
"By using the optimization software tool HOMER, this project aims at the energetic and economical optimization of a RES-based stand-alone system, already installed at Leicestershire, UK. Based on local meteorological data, an optimization strategy has been developed to identify the most economical and efficient scenarios for the generation of electricity to cover the desirable load in annual basis. Furthermore, the environmental-friendly character of the system was highly concerned in terms of emissions reduction, therefore the capability of an off-grid system was also investigated. The simulations show that an off-grid project with zero emissions is feasible, presenting the additional advantage of minimal capital investment costs. Finally, it is found that grid connection corresponds to very high operational costs in a long term. (C) 2010 Professor T. Nejat Veziroglu. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",1
"Sea-level rise induces a permanent loss of land with widespread ecological and economic impacts, most evident in urban and densely populated areas. Potential coastline retreat combined with waves and storm surges will result in more severe damages for coastal zones, especially over insular systems. In this paper, we quantify the effects of sea-level rise in terms of potential coastal flooding and potential beach erosion, along the coasts of the Balearic Islands (Western Mediterranean Sea), during the twenty-first century. We map projected flooded areas under two climate-change-driven mean sea-level rise scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5), together with the impact of an extreme event defined by the 100-year return level of joint storm surges and waves. We quantify shoreline retreat of sandy beaches forced by the sea-level rise (scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) and the continuous action of storm surges and waves (modeled by synthetic time series). We estimate touristic recreational services decrease of sandy beaches caused by the obtained shoreline retreat, in monetary terms. According to our calculations, permanent flooding by the end of our century will extend 7.8-27.7 km(2) under the RCP4.5 scenario (mean sea-level rise between 32 and 80 cm by 2100), and up to 10.9-36.5 km(2) under RCP8.5 (mean sea-level rise between 46 and 103 cm by 2100). Some beaches will lose more than 50% of their surface by the end of the century: 20-50% of them under RCP4.5 scenario and 25-60% under RCP8.5 one. Loss of touristic recreational services could represent a gross domestic product (GDP) loss up to 7.2% with respect to the 2019 GDP.",0

"A new hybrid switched-capacitor multilevel inverter is proposed. The proposed inverter consists of a combination of the switched-capacitor units connected in series and the T-type bidirectional switches connected to an H-bridge. This inverter has the reduced number of components and generates the boosted multilevel output voltage in a single-stage without any bulky magnetic devices, which can make the size and cost of a power inverter substantially reduced. It can also generate the high voltage multilevel output waveforms only by using the low voltage DC-sources and the low-voltage devices. In addition, the guaranteed capacitor voltage balancing can be achieved by the proposed modulation method with the T-type switches. Experimental results with a nine-level inverter system are presented to demonstrate the proposed topology and modulation method.",0
"Considerable efforts are made in order to reduce the power sector's carbon footprint. Paired with a realization that thermal power plants are likely to play a significant role during the transitional period towards a 100% sustainable energy system, carbon capture and storage (CCS) retrofit is becoming a growingly important consideration for a number of power plant operators. This paper analyzes the possibility of retrofitting a coal-fired power plant based in Croatia. A techno-economic model of the proposed unit is built setting up key elements of the technological solution and determining their capital and operational costs. Both a sensitivity analysis and a market analysis are conducted in order to best evaluate the feasibility of the CCS retrofit project. Particularities of South East Europe power sectors are considered utilizing an optimization software. Special consideration is given to the influence of the EU emission trading scheme (ETS) on CCS projects. Further research focuses on the main factors influencing the potential implementation of CCS. Key recommendations that might aid CCS deployment are outlined signaling stronger government support, stable regulatory framework, and market incentives as crucial factors able to foster CCS development. Considering the project in the study, analyses showed that, although technically feasible, CCS retrofit is currently not a financially viable option. Without a stable regulatory framework able to guarantee an adequate supporting scheme, the project is not market competitive. It is important to note that the economic gap of CCS retrofit has been considerably reduced during the past years.",1
"There is a need to develop new control strategies for interconnecting renewable energy systems (RESs) to the power grid due to the continuously increasing penetration of RES and, in particular, of wind power systems. The control strategies are typically based on a fast and accurate detection of the phase angle of the grid voltage which may be estimated by using a phase-locked loop (PLL) control circuit. The performance of the PLL under normal and abnormal operational conditions is a crucial aspect, since the RES is desired to operate accurately to support the power system under grid fault conditions. This paper investigates the performance of three different PLLs: a synchronous reference frame (SRF) PLL, a stationary reference frame PLL, and a decoupled double SRF PLL. The results of this investigation motivate the development of a new hybrid PLL which is a combination of the aforementioned PLLs and uses the advantages of each PLL. The proposed decoupled stationary reference frame PLL (d alpha beta PLL) may be an appropriate solution to use in an interconnected RES with fault ride through (FRT) capability, since it prevails the other PLLs with regard to its accuracy under unbalanced faults. Furthermore, it has a lower deviation of the estimated phase after the fault occurs. This could be depicted as a faster response of the d alpha beta PLL within the same frequency limits. The performance of the new hybrid d alpha beta PLL is verified through simulations and experiments. Furthermore, the new PLL is used in an interconnected RES through experiments under normal and FRT operations.",1
"To achieve energy neutrality in wastewater treatment, reduction of energy consumption and renewable energy production has been proposed as a sustainable solution within circular economy. The performance of an anaerobic Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR) digesting sewage sludge from a Chemically Enhanced Primary Treatment (CEPT) unit regarding organic carbon removal and renewable biogas production was evaluated under various Hydraulic Retention Times (HRTs). Anaerobic digestion of CEPT instead of primary sludge resulted in higher Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) and Volatile Suspended Solids (VSS) removal efficiencies, i.e. 46-51% and 28-35% for CEPT sludge compared to 33% and 20% for primary sludge, respectively. Biogas production from CEPT sludge was constant and stable (0.15-0.16 L/L.d) at all HRTs examined, while biogas production was lower during digestion of primary sludge (0.06 L/L.d). The combination of CEPT, which concentrates organic matter derived from wastewater and minimizes oxygen consumption, and the anaerobic digestion of the CEPT sludge, which reduces energy consumption and generates renewable energy form non-conventional resources, provides a sustainable wastewater treatment practice towards circular economy. In a study performed for the proposed CEPT thorn CSTR scheme for the treatment of wastewater in a city with 50,000 population equivalent, the annual energy gain was estimated as 1,314,000 kWh.

"The Benefit integration of distributed energy resources (DER) into distribution grid or large-scale renewable energy sources (RES) into transmission systems faces a considerable challenge to existing power system protection. In such case the coordination system of the protection is failed completely.

"This paper presents a binary topology of Multi-module level inverters produce a staircase output voltage from renewable DC voltage sources. The MLI (Multi Level Inverter) Requires many number of semiconductor switches is main drawback of multilevel inverters. The MLI can be classified as two method, one is symmetric and another asymmetric converters.

In this paper, a discrete binary topology for multilevel converters is proposed using cascaded sub-multilevel Cells. This sub-multilevel converter can produce sixty three levels of voltage from five discrete DC source. The Total Harmonic Distortions (THD) is minimized by discrete binary topology. The working operation and performance of the proposed multilevel inverters studies has been verified by simulation of using SIMULINK / MA TLAB results.",0
"Policy makers and citizens must choose from among a growing variety of strategic options as they try to cope optimally with climate change. As a means of more accurately predicting different types of climate change engagement, we empirically distinguish individuals' felt responsibility for mitigation (FRm) from felt responsibility for adaptation (FRa), and assess support for different climate action strategies (mitigation and adaptation). We surveyed two U.S. samples two months apart, and the replication study confirmed Study l's findings of differing predictive powers for FRm vs. FRa. Each type of felt responsibility, controlling for the other, served as a mediator between belief in global warming (as well as belief in anthropogenic cause of climate change) and its corresponding climate action strategy (mitigation vs. adaptation). FRa predicted adaptation measures but not mitigation measures, while FRm predicted mitigation measures more strongly than it predicted adaptation but did predict both action strategies. We also found important individual differences: people's disposition toward behaving proactively correlated positively with all types of climate engagement, and political orientation (liberal/ conservative ideology) interacted with climate action strategy (mitigation vs. adaptation) in predicting all engagement variables. Comparing levels of support across the political spectrum, the mitigation measures were highly polarizing, while the adaptation measures were less divisive. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

"Improving the energy efficiency of conventional energy services is an essential way to cope with global CO2 emissions mitigation. To date, energy efficiency improvement (EEI) has been broadly introduced exogenously in integrated assessment models (IAMs) by virtue of the autonomous energy efficiency improvement (AEEI) coefficient; however, it is usually good at capturing the EEI driven by non-price factors, while weak in describing the EEI induced by policy incentives. In this paper, we introduce an endogenous EEI (EEEI) mechanism in an IAM, called E3METL, to explore the impacts of EEEI on the global macro-economy, CO2 emission paths, and timing of carbon mitigations. The results reveal that (1) introducing EEEI significantly improves gross world product (GWP) gains, and this positive effect is partly offset when carbon restriction policies are implemented; (2) R&D investment dedicated to enhance energy efficiency limits R&D expenditures for other alternative technologies, and this effect will impede the development of non-fossil technologies; (3) EEEI may perform as one of supporting factors to delay the actions of carbon reduction; moreover, the introduction of EEEI lowers the optimal carbon tax level by 7.8 % on average, as compared to the no EEEI case.",1
"Although colonization of artificial structures by epibenthic communities is well-documented overall, our understanding of colonization processes is largely limited to low-energy environments. In this study, we monitored epibenthic colonization of different structures associated with a tidal energy test site located in a high-energy hydrodynamic environment. Using four years of image-based underwater surveys, we characterized changes through space and time in the taxonomic composition of epibenthic assemblages colonizing two kinds of artificial structures, as well as the surrounding natural habitat. Our results highlight that ecological successions followed similar trends across the two artificial habitats, but that different habitat-specific communities emerged at the end of our survey. Deployment of these artificial structures resulted in the addition of elevated and stable substrata in an environment where natural hard substrates are unstable and strongly exposed to sediment abrasion. Although epibenthic communities colonizing artificial habitats are unlikely to have reached a mature stage at the end of our survey, these supported structurally complex taxa facilitating an overall increase in local diversity. We were able to quantify how epibenthic communities can significantly vary over time in high-energy coastal environment, and our final survey suggests that the ecological succession was still in progress five years after the deployment of artificial reefs. Thus, maintaining long-term continuous survey of coastal artificial reef habitats will be key to better discriminate between long-term ecological successions and shorter-term variability.",0
"As the energy management undergoes rapid transformations, there's an imperative need for innovative energy management frameworks. Responding to this, our research introduces an advanced energy management framework, synergistically combining quantum computing advancements with a robust trust management system. At the core of our proposition is the utilization of Quantum Annealing (QA) and Quantum-inspired Genetic Algorithm (QGA) for energy distribution, offering marked improvements in speed, accuracy, and scalability. Complementing this, multi-objective decision-making algorithms are integrated, optimizing trade-offs in intricate scenarios. Central to ensuring system reliability, the trust management system ensures improved regulation and compliance adherence. Our approach's potency is further evidenced by its wide applicability, demonstrated through diverse case studies ranging from solar power plant management to smart city energy distribution. Experimental simulations underscore the framework's efficacy, establishing its relevance in today's dynamic energy ecosystems.",1
"The 2012 European energy efficiency directive supported the development of cogeneration combined heat and power (CHP) and district heating and cooling (DHC) networks, stressing the benefits of a more efficient energy supply, the exploitation of recovered heat, and renewable resources, in terms of fuel consumption and avoided costs/emissions. Policy decisions play a crucial role: technical and environmental feasibility of CHP is clear and well demonstrated, whereas economic issues (fuel prices, incentives, etc.) may influence its actual application. In this framework, the introduction of low-carbon technologies and the exploitation of renewable energies are profitable interventions to be applied on existing plants. This work focuses on a small CHP plant, installed in the 90s and located within a research facility in Italy, designed to supply electricity and heat/cool through a district network. On the basis of monitored consumption of electricity, heating, and cooling, energy fluxes have been analyzed and an assessment was performed to get a management profile enhancing both operational and economic parameters. The integration of renewable energies, i.e., solar-powered systems for supporting the existing devices, has been evaluated, thus resulting in a hybrid trigeneration plant. Results demonstrate how the useful synergy between CHP and DHC can not only be profitable from the economic point of view, but it can also create conditions to considerably boost the integral deployment of primary energy sources, improving fuel diversity and then facing the challenge of climate change toward sustainable energy networks in the future.",1
"Long-term cover-cropping and no-tillage practices can facilitate soil organic carbon (SOC) accumulation in agroecosystems for soil health and climate mitigation benefits. However, the contribution of these conservation management practices to SOC gain from the subsoil layers is not extensively studied. To understand this knowledge gap, it is essential to determine the distribution of total SOC and SOC fractions in response to management practices across the soil profile. Therefore, this study was conducted by leveraging a 40-year replicated field experiment in a continuous cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) system. The management treatments examined included three cover crop treatments: 1) hairy vetch, HV (Vicia villosa); 2) winter wheat, WW (Triticum aestivum L.), and 3) no cover crop, NC; and two tillage treatments: 1) chisel-tillage, CT (10 cm deep) and 2) no -tillage, NT. Soil samples were collected from four depths (0-5, 5-10, 10-30, and 30-60 cm) and analyzed for total SOC and C fractions such as microbial biomass (MBC), particulate organic matter (POM-C), and mineral -associated organic matter (MAOM-C). Results showed that the profile-scale (0-60 cm) SOC stock was greater for WW (33.7 Mg ha(-1)) compared to HV (29.1 Mg ha(-1)) and NC (24.4 Mg ha(-1)), while the tillage effect was non-significant (28 Mg ha(-1 )for NT and 29.3 Mg ha-1 for CT). The NT increased SOC in the top 5-cm layer, which was reflected in the concentrations of POM-C and MBC. Below the tillage depth (10-30 cm), SOC accrual was greater under CT (10.4 Mg ha-1) than NT (8.9 Mg ha(-1)), despite similar profile-scale SOC stocks. Further analysis revealed that total SOC in topsoil and subsoil were driven by POM and MAOM-related parameters, respectively. We also observed a limited accumulation of C in POM fraction (0.2-6.1 g C kg (-1) soil in tilled topsoil and 0.01-0.71 g C kg (-1) soil in subsoil) with a weak relationship with total SOC concentration (topsoil slope = 0.29, subsoil slope = 0.13). Contrastingly, accumulation of C in MAOM fraction was greater (2.7-12.7 g C kg( -1) soil in topsoil and 0.6-5.4 g C kg (-1) soil in subsoil), and it was strongly related to total SOC concentration than POM-C, especially in the subsoil (topsoil slope = 0.43, subsoil slope = 0.71). Growing deep-rooted winter wheat cover crop increased SOC in the subsoil, indicating the need for climate, soil, and ecosystem-specific management practices for profile-scale net SOC accumulation and redistribution in agroecosystems.",1
"Incorporation of distributed energy resources (DERs) in power distribution networks makes the system combined and lively. Presence of DER with variable generating capacity at different locations converts protection coordination problem (PCP) to a very challenging one. In this paper, authors have proposed an online adaptive protection scheme based on relay coordination to tackle PCP, when renewable energy based distributed generators penetrate power in the system with conventional generators. Directional overcurrent relays (DORs) are one of the main elements of protection schemes in power systems. The PCP is formulated as nonlinear programming problem with DORs for different operating combinations. The adaptive algorithm uses an afresh published optimization technique, namely, Symbiotic Organism Search (SOS) installed at SCADA computers. The program is coded in MATLAB to find the optimal settings of relay parameters, time dial setting (TDS) and pickup current (I-p) setting, which gives minimum operating time during any fault. Operational ability of the algorithm is validated on IEEE 14 bus distribution system by varying generation arrangements of DER in different combinations. Every time for slight variation in the system fault current level may be due to variation in line parameters or incorporation of new DERs; new relay settings are communicated to corresponding relays. The proposed protection scheme is highly flexible to sustain the protection coordination among DORs, maintaining reliable coordination margin for each primary/backup relay pair for every combination.",1
"This article proposes an interleaved high step-up DC-DC converter topology designed for renewable energy applications, featuring an ultra-high voltage conversion ratio. The converter employs an interleaved structure, resulting in a low peak-to-peak ripple in the input source current, which is particularly advantageous for solar PV sources. To enhance the output voltage, the topology utilizes voltage multiplier cells (VMC) and coupled inductor techniques. Two coupled inductors with three windings are integrated into the proposed topology, with the secondary and tertiary windings combined with VMC. This combination effectively reduces the maximum voltage stress across power switches, enabling the use of low-rated and cost-effective power switches for implementation. The article offers comprehensive operation modes and steady-state analyses to demonstrate the converter's performance. A comparison is made between the suggested structure and other similar converter topologies. To validate the mathematical analysis, a 200-W prototype is constructed, operating at a frequency of 25 kHz and achieving a voltage conversion range of 20 to 409 V. The experimental results are presented to support the findings. An interleaved high step-up DC-DC converter topology with ultra-high voltage conversion ratio is proposed in this article for renewable energy applications.image",0
"One of the topics receiving much attention in recent years is climate change and the potential of its integration in impact assessment, both in terms of achieving mitigation and adaptation. Renewable energy projects are part of the efforts to mitigate climate change, replacing the use of fossil fuel with CO2-neutral energy sources. A variety of these projects are subject to environmental impact assessment (EIA), which raises the following questions: What role does an impact assessment play? When is the project environmentally friendly? How are climate change-related impacts assessed in projects with inherent positive effects on climate change? This paper reviews practice, and takes up these questions based on a document study of 19 EIA reports of renewable energy projects in Denmark. The results show that climate change mitigation is included in 18 of the EIA reports reviewed, while adaptation is absent. Also, the results show an emphasis on positive impacts in the reports, and in a few cases discussions of enhancements. Identification and assessment of negative climate change impacts are less apparent. This leads to a discussion of the results in the light of the purpose of EIA.",1
"Recent global environmental concerns have called for efforts to promote the transition of energy sources toward renewable energy, particularly in emerging countries that prioritize high economic growth. One missing aspect in environmental studies is that renewable energy is composed of traditional and modern ones, where the former could induce environmental and health problems, and the latter could solve them. Accounting for different types of renewable energy, this study evaluates the energy mix evolution in relation to a country's development level (proxied by real GDP per capita) for 23 emerging countries from 1990 to 2016. By applying the pooled mean group autoregressive distributed lag (PMG-ARDL) model, we examine the short-and long-run linkages of a country's income level with the energy mix. To capture the energy mix, we use three variables of energy sources, (i) non-renewable, (ii) traditional renewable, and (iii) modern renewable energy. Our results show that the in-come level has a long-run positive relationship with non-renewable and modern renewable energy but a long-run negative relationship with traditional renewable energy. Our findings shed light on the importance of imple-menting policies targeting the shift from non-renewable energy toward modern renewable energy by the poli-cymakers concerned in emerging countries.",1
"Adaptation and mitigation are both essential components of strategies that aim to decrease risks associated with climate change. A number of existing studies, however, suggest that the two might be negatively affecting each other - climate adaptation might decrease mitigation efforts and vice versa. We have examined these effects in five experimental studies carried out in four countries (total N = 4,800) and have used Bayesian analysis to evaluate the strength of empirical support for such effects. We did not find any evidence that compensation between climate mitigation and adaptation takes place. On the contrary, we found some evidence, albeit rather weak, that prior focus on adaptation measures increases the subsequent tendency to engage in mitigation behavior; this effect is likely to be driven by an increase in worry about the impacts of climate change that results from a prior focus on climate adaptation. If anything, offering adaptation options may increase the tendency to mitigate climate change.",0
"Although ammonia-based CO2 capture has attracted global research attention, several inherent issues with this technology remain to-be resolved. To address these problems, a new design for carbon capture using ammonia is proposed on the basis of anti-solvent crystallization, also known as precipitation crystallization. The crystallization of a low carbonized absorbent was found to-be, enhanced in the crystallizer using an-anti-solvent process, which can maintain a high absorption rate and simultaneously prevent crystallization from occurring in the absorption tower. Energy consumption for sorbent regeneration is, reduced by regenerating the crystal product rather than the rich-solution. Energy-cascade utilization-is an effective way to improve the use of energy. In this work, steam was used to drive a heat pump that extracts energy from discharged flue gas from a wet flue gas desulfurization system in. a power plant to enablethe recovery of low-temperature residual energy; this energy can be used in the crystal regeneration process, thereby further reducing the energy required for regeneration. Aspen Plus (version 8.4) software was adopted:to simulate the flue gas condensation, heat-pump circulation, and steam drive'-subsystems. The simulation results showed that 10 heat pumps (6.04 MW) can meet the regeneration energy requirement of the CO, capture process in a 300 MW coal-fired unit and recycle 40.6 MW of low-temperature heat. The extraction steam requirement is low, which reduces the impact on power-generation.",1
"Earlier studies evidence that oil price shocks have significant impacts on clean energy stock returns. While the previous literature uses traditional oil price series to investigate such effects, we aim to assess whether the variance of alternative energy stock returns can be explained using the information content of crude oil volatility index (OVX), an indicator of oil price uncertainty. To serve our purpose, we employ several measures to frame the realized volatility (RV) of alternative energy sector equity returns. In particular, we use three different range-based RV estimators recommended by Parkinson (1980), Rogers and Satchell (1991) and Alizadeh et al. (2002) respectively. Our findings reveal that clean energy stock market returns are highly sensitive to OVX shocks. Thus oil market uncertainty, measured by OVX, embodies a crucial role in modeling the volatility of renewable energy equity returns. In addition, we find a strong indication that OVX provides additional information beyond what is contained in the historical volatilities of equity returns. We also document that the magnitude of the effect of OVX is much bigger than that of the realized variance of WTI oil spot prices. Finally, we find that the information content of crude oil volatility index improves the volatility forecasts for the clean energy equity market. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
"A Close Coupled Showerhead MOCVD reactor has been used to grow GaN-InGaN quantum well (QW) structures and LEDs using two different growth regimes, one in which the wells are grown at a lower temperature than the barriers and the other in which both are grown at the same temperature. In general the optical quality of single temperature multi-quantum wells (MQWs) are superior to that of structures grown at two temperatures but the latter have been proved easier to optimise for operation at longer wavelengths. Improved emission wavelength uniformity has been noted for the single temperature structures and XRD and low temperature PL measurements of the latter have indicated that high quality structures have been achieved. Time resolved PL has shown that the radiative carrier lifetime increases with the indium content of the quantum wells making longer wavelength structures more susceptible to competition from non-radiative recombination.",0
"Plantation forests are essential in driving global biogeochemical cycling and mitigating climate change. Biodiversity and environmental factors can shape multiple forest ecosystem functions simultaneously (i.e., multifunctionality). However, their effect on multifunctionality when pure plantations are converted into two-aged plantations remains underexplored. Therefore, we assessed above- and below-ground biodiversity and environmental factors and 11 ecosystem functions in different plantation types in subtropical China. The two-aged mixed plantations exhibited higher multifunctionality than did a pure plantation, primarily due to soil fungal diversity and secondarily due to tree diversity, based on the coefficient of variation for tree diameter at breast height (CVD) and community-weighted specific leaf area (CWMSLA). Further analysis revealed saprotrophy as the key soil fungal trophic mode in maintaining multifunctionality. Moreover, structural equation modeling confirmed that soil environmental factors, namely the soil water content and pH, had no direct association with multifunctionality, but were indirectly related to multifunctionality via elevated CVD and CWMSLA, respectively. Our results indicate that the tree and soil fungal diversity, as well as soil environmental factors, resulting from the conversion of pure plantations to two-aged mixed plantations, can enhance multifunctionality, and provide a better comprehensive understanding of the driving mechanisms of multifunctionality, leading to the sustainable management of subtropical plantation forest ecosystems.",1
"Oil for electricity generation, burning of coal, heat production is the largest sources of greenhouse emission that cause climate change worldwide. Therefore the diffusion of solar PV technologies has become a crucial component for both climate change mitigation and adaptation of the electrical system on a global scale. In this survey, we analyzed the state of the art of the present large scale Photovoltaic application (technology, size, efficiency, cost). We investigated also in detail the commercially available new PV technologies, e.g.: Thin film, Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC), organic PV cells (OPV), and their near future's application perspectives. Finally, this paper summarizes the research findings of the new PV technologies' challenge that need to be overcome, on particular stability, efficiency, lifetime and degradation. In order to realize their potential as an economically viable path to harvesting energy from sunlight.",1
"This article investigates the concept and measurement of regulatory decentralization with a focus on minimum wages and renewable electricity standards. These two policy areas are chosen because they admit of a clear interpretation in continuous terms and vary substantially across jurisdictions. Concurrent central and subcentral regulatory competencies have a straightforward quantitative interpretation in these two policy areas. The article presents data on the effective autonomy of subcentral governments to determine their own minimum wage rates and renewable energy standards. It then tests whether more decentralized minimum wage and renewable energy regulatory regimes yield a consistently lower level of regulation and higher degree of interregional policy variation. I find that central governments are more likely to set regulatory minimums than maximums in these areas, and that therefore regulatory centralization does promote a higher level of regulation, but likely not through a competitive dynamic, and less policy variance.",1
"Our society faces several challenges due to the scarcity of clean water and the depletion of non-renewable, fossil fuel-based energy resources. In this context, traditional wastewater treatment technologies open up opportunities to guarantee the availability of safe drinking water, prevent detrimental ecological impact, and address climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, they require substantial financial and energy investment, limiting their adoption in resource-limited countries. Over the past few decades, bioelectrochemical systems, such as microbial fuel cells (MFCs), have gained great interest owing to their ability to detoxify waste streams and generate renewable energy (e.g., electricity). The distinguishing features of MFCs allow them to be a central component of several integrated wastewater treatment systems, including constructed wetland-microbial fuel cells (CW-MFCs), that have the capability to overcome the operating challenges associated with individual traditional technologies. Coupling MFCs with CWs enables the adjustment of redox activities and the balance of electron flow in both aerobic and anaerobic zones, thereby alleviating the constraint of the limited supply of electron acceptors and enhancing the capacity to manage its operation. In addition, CW-MFCs offer advantages compared to traditional wastewater treatment technologies, such as high chemical oxygen demand (COD) and nitrogen removal effectiveness, the ability to generate electricity, and the ability to remove persistent pollutants. This review article will critically assess the existing literature on the advantages and research opportunities of CW-MFCs for wastewater treatment and electricity generation. Furthermore, it provides an in-depth understanding of application guidance and the current key challenges of CW-MFCs.",1
"The emergence of variable renewable energy and battery storage technologies have fundamentally transformed the electric power sector and generated demand for analysis to understand their roles in future energy systems. Although unique characteristics of these resources are well-recognized and require more sophisticated methodologies to capture effectively, guidance is limited on best practices and research gaps. This paper selectively reviews recent literature and draws upon our collective modeling experience to offer recommendations to analysts and consumers of model outputs on approaches for modeling variable renewable energy and storage in long-term electric sector models. We focus on regional- and national-scale models with technological, temporal, and spatial detail given their prevalence in planning and policy analysis, though insights are applicable in other settings. The review highlights how the research frontier has advanced in representing renewables and energy storage over the past decade; however, given the many considerations involved with appropriately capturing salient economic and operational characteristics of renewables, there is a gap between commonly used models and state-of-the-art methods. Model simplifications can materially impact policy analysis associated with power sector decarbonization and high renewables deployment, and improving model representations of variable renewables can enhance insights for policymakers and other stakeholders. This review can point the way for improved methods for established models and designs for emerging ones.",1
"This study evaluates effectiveness of driver education teaching greater fuel efficiency (Eco-Driving) in a real world setting in Australia. The driving behaviour, measured in fuel use (litres per 100 km of travel) of a sample of 1056 private drivers was monitored over seven months. 853 drivers received education in eco-driving techniques and 203 were monitored as a control group. A simple experimental design was applied comparing the pre and post training fuel use of the treated sample compared to a control sample.

"A series of closely related primary, secondary, and tertiary alkanolamine model compounds were monitored in real time in aqueous solution via in situ nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy while purging CO2-rich gas through the solution over a range of temperatures. The real-time in situ spectroscopic monitoring of this reaction chemistry provides new insight about reaction pathways through identification of primary products and their transformations into secondary products. New mechanistic pathways were observed and elucidated. The effects of CO2 loadings, relative absorption and desorption kinetics, pH, temperature, and other critical features of the amine/CO2 reaction system are discussed in detail. The effect of amine basicity and structure on these parameters was further elucidated by studying complementary electron-rich and -poor amines (pK(a) similar to 4.5-11) and guanidines (pK(a) similar to 14-15). While tertiary amines act only as simple proton acceptors, primary and secondary amines function as both bases and nudeophiles to form carbamates and (bi) carbonates, whose product ratio is a function of both reaction conditions and amine steric and electronic properties. Water is also acting as a Lewis base by hydrolysis of carbamate species into bicarbonate, which results in a more beneficial 1:1 CO2/amine ratio. Primary and secondary amines tend to react with CO2 similarly at different CO2 partial pressures, showing weak pressure dependence upon CO2 loading; in contrast, reaction efficiencies of tertiary amines, which generally form less stable carbonate and bicarbonate products, are a strong function of CO2 pressure. Primary and secondary amines capture significantly less CO2 per mole of amine than tertiary amines (lower CO2 loading capacities) because of the formation of carbarnate species. Their faster reaction rates with CO2 and high capture efficiencies at low CO2 partial pressures are advantageous. In contrast, tertiary amines more effectively react with CO2 at lower temperatures, capturing up to 1 CO2 per amine; initially and unexpectedly, carbonate and bicarbonate species are initially formed simultaneously. Even at high pH, carbonates evolve into a final bicarbonate product. The secondary benefit of forming bicarbonates is their lower thermal stability (greater ease of desorption). Unexpectedly, guanidines do not form bicarbonates directly; the reaction proceeds via exclusive initial formation of the guanidinium carbonate. In summary, varying amine basicity leads to significant changes in the carbamate/(bi)carbonate equilibrium and stability of reaction products.",1
Protecting natural habitats in priority areas is essential to halt the loss of biodiversity. Yet whether these benefits for biodiversity also yield benefits for human well-being remains controversial. Here we assess the potential human well-being benefits of safeguarding a global network of sites identified as top priorities for the conservation of threatened species. Conserving these sites would yield benefits - in terms of a) climate change mitigation through avoidance of CO2 emissions from deforestation; b) freshwater services to downstream human populations; c) retention of option value; and d) benefits to maintenance of human cultural diversity - significantly exceeding those anticipated from randomly selected sites within the same countries and ecoregions. Results suggest that safeguarding sites important for biodiversity conservation provides substantial benefits to human well-being.,1
"During traditional processing and utilizing of converter gas, a common by-product gas of steel production, the recycling of waste heat is insufficient, carbon emission is high, and the added value of the gas is low. The reforming of converter gas with coke oven gas is proposed to utilize the gas more efficiently. The reforming recycles the waste heat of the gas by thermochemical energy storage technology and converts CH4 and CO2 into H-2 and CO, which improves the recovery rate of the waste heat and gas added value, and reduces the direct emission of CO2. Thermodynamic equilibrium calculation and regression analysis were used to investigate the effects of the temperature, pressure, and mole fraction of coke oven gas on the results of the reforming. The results show that atmospheric pressure and the temperature range of 850 degrees C-1000 degrees C are suitable for the reforming, at which the conversion rates of CH4 and CO2 are more than 90% and 75%, respectively. The ratio of H-2 to CO is determined by the mole fraction of coke oven gas. Then, the reforming process was investigated by experiments which simulated the reforming process in converter flue. The experimental results show that the in-suit catalysis of converter dust can significantly improve the conversion rates of CH4 and CO2 and the conversion rates can reach a high level at about 1000 degrees C. Then, the waste heat utilization of the reforming was investigated, and it was concluded that 35-40% of the waste heat is converted into chemical energy in the reforming. After the waste heat power generation of the product gas, the total recovery rate of waste heat is 60-65%. Finally, the amount of coke oven gas reformed by a fixed amount of converter gas without additional heating was calculated. The results show that when the preheating temperature of coke oven gas is 500 degrees C the range of 850 degrees C-900 degrees C is appropriate for the reforming, at which the conversion rate of CO2 is approximately 50% and about 40% of the waste heat was converted to chemical energy. For a steel plant with an annual output of 20 million, the direct emission of CO2 can reduce by 2.13 x 10(8) Nm(3), and waste heat of 3.24 x 10(6) GJ can be converted into chemical energy.",1
"The photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into fuels provides a direct route to produce renewable energy from sunlight. NiO loaded InTaO4 photocatalyst was prepared by a sol-gel method. Aqueous-phase CO2 photoreduction was performed in a quartz reactor to search for the highest photoactivity in a series of NiO/InTaO4 photocatalysts. Thereafter, the best NiO/InTaO4 was dip coated on optical fibers and calcined at 1100 degrees C. A uniform NiO/InTaO4 layer of 0.14 mu m in thickness was observed on the optical fiber. An optical-fiber photoreactor, comprised of similar to 216 NiO/InTaO4-coated fibers, was designed to transmit and spread light uniformly inside the reactor. The UV-vis spectra of powder InTaO4 as well as NiO loaded InTaO4 prepared via the same procedure indicated that both photocatalysts could absorb visible light. XRD confirmed that InTaO4 was in single phase. Vapor-phase CO2 was photocatalytically reduced to methanol using the optical-fiber reactor under visible light and real sunlight irradiation in a steady-state flow system. The rate of methanol production was 11.1 mu mol/gh with light intensity of 327 mW/cm(2) at 25 degrees C. Increasing the reaction temperature to 75 degrees C increased the production rate to 21.0 mu mol/gh. Methanol production rate was 11.30 mu mol/gh by utilizing concentrated sunlight which was comparable to the result of using artificial visible light. The quantum efficiencies were estimated to be 0.0045% and 0.063% in aqueous-phase and optical-fiber reactors, respectively, per gram NiO/InTaO4 photocatalyst. The quantum efficiency increased due to the superior light-energy utilization of NiO/InTaO4 thin film in the optical-fiber reactor. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",1
"Introduction: Policymakers devote significant efforts to decrease CO2 emissions, as climate change has Q7 numerous adverse impacts on society. While the global level of CO2 emissions has been gradually rising since the 1990s, the highest growth was observed in low- and middle-income economies. This study differs from nascent research as it fills the gap by exploring the GDP-energy-CO2 emissions nexus for the top 50 highly globalized countries under analysis. Our study explores the multidimensional relationship between economic growth, renewable energy, globalization, and climate change, using CO2 emissions as a proxy for air pollution, and focusing on the most globalized countries.Methods: In this study, we rely on dynamic panel estimators such as the two-step system GMM estimator. System GMM estimator is recommended to use with the panel data when 1) the correlation between a dependent variable and its lag is above 0.8; and 2) the number of countries (i.e., 50 countries) exceeds the time frame (i.e., 19 years). As our study design fits these conditions, we use extension of a two-step system GMM estimator which restricts the expansion of instruments. Moreover, a two-step system GMM estimator is especially efficient as it controls for heteroskedasticity.Results: We find that renewable energy and globalization decrease CO2 emissions. If causal, a 1 percentage point increase in the share of renewable energy in total energy consumption leads to a 0.26% decrease in per capita CO2 emissions. Similarly, we find that a larger representation of women in national parliament contributes to the reduction in CO2 emissions. GDP per capita has an inverted U-shaped relationship with CO2 emissions and the turning point is approximately 67,200 international dollars adjusted for PPP.Discussion: Our results suggest that renewable energy significantly contributes to the reduction of carbon emissions while GDP per capita has an inverted U-shaped link with CO2 emissions. Thus, we confirm the presence of the EKC hypothesis for highly-globalized countries. Consequently, our study offers several policy implications. Firstly, it is important for developing countries to increase the share of energy consumed from renewable energy sources. This will have a positive effect not only on air quality, but also on economic growth. Thus, it is essential to increase investment in the renewable energy sector and create conditions and benefits for the rapid adoption of renewable technologies by the private sector and households. Secondly, it is crucial to increase the quality of investment climate. Developing countries can significantly gain from globalization-driven FDI as this can lead to technology transfer, especially in the energy sector. Thirdly, our results suggest that improving female empowerment can significantly reduce the vulnerability to climate change. This can be achieved by increasing women's human capital and investing in women-led organizations and communities.",1
"Despite the increasing level of renewable power generation in power grids, fossil fuel power plants still have a significant role in producing carbon emissions. The integration of carbon capturing and storing systems to the conventional power plants can significantly reduce the spread of carbon emissions. In this article, the economic-emission dispatch of combined renewable and coal power plants equipped with carbon capture systems is addressed in a multiobjective optimization framework. The power system's flexibility is enhanced by hydropower plants, pumped hydro storage, and demand response program. The wind generation and load consumption uncertainties are modeled using stochastic programming. The dc power flow model is implemented on a modified IEEE 24-bus test system. Solving the problem resulted in an optimal Pareto frontier, while the fuzzy decision-making method found the best solution. The sensitivity of the objective functions concerning the generation-side is also investigated.",1
"This paper explores decision-making in the context of active default choices, i.e., choices made when no alternative is presented. Using data from a UT energy study, the paper examines how active defaults influence participation in a hypothetical green renewable energy utility program. The study analyzes collective effects and considers demographic and psychographic factors. Significant impacts on default choices and framing were observed for attributes like age, political preference, years at current residence, perception of home efficiency, natural gas consumption, and importance of saving energy. The research demonstrates that specific demographic attributes are more susceptible to nudging effects when presented with a climate-change-related program, but scenarios with opt-out framing alone yielded the most significant results across all attributes. Consequently, the paper recommends that policymakers and utility firms proposing renewable energy programs use an opt-out default choice for certain demographic groups to enhance receptivity and participation. The study's average of 46% willingness to participate in a more expensive utility renewable energy program suggests a need for further investigation into the link between hypothetical willingness and actual follow-through. Ultimately, the findings underscore the potential benefits of default choices and nudging effects in addressing climate change-related issues among stakeholders seeking to mitigate environmental impacts.",1
"The sustainability of the environment debate cannot be addressed without considering the type of energy to use. The pace at which the world is industrializing, globalizing, and developing economically has prompted many researchers to investigate the kind of energy required to preserve the environment. In this regard, this study employs the mediation model to assess renewable energy's direct and indirect effects on carbon emissions through globalization. The data for the study is from 1990 to 2020. The study's findings showed that while renewable energy has no appreciable impact on trade openness, it directly and negatively affects carbon emissions. However, foreign direct investment has a direct and significant positive effect on carbon emissions, while trade openness has no significant effect. The indirect result revealed that renewable energy through foreign direct investment has a negative effect on carbon emissions; however, renewable energy through trade openness has a positive effect on carbon emissions. Policymakers are encouraged to restrict the trade sector to reduce the trading of high-emission technologies.",1
"This article examines trends in development assistance funding for energy and the implications for mitigating climate change. It presents financial data from bilateral and multilateral donors during 1997-2005, a period that begins with the agreement on the Kyoto Protocol under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. During this period, aid for energy totalled over US$64 billion or 6-10% of all development assistance. Annual energy assistance was virtually stagnant at approximately US$6-7 billion from 1997 to 2005, but preliminary evidence indicates that some efforts are being made to fill the resource gap and to mitigate climate change. Analysis suggests that there has been somewhat of a shift away from fossil fuel to lower greenhouse-gas-emitting projects. However, the increases in funding and shifts to low greenhouse gas technologies are fragile. Analysis also suggests that, unless development assistance for energy increases in the coming years, the influence of multilateral banks will diminish and their ability to encourage sustainable energy projects will decline. It should be noted that funding levels for projects do not tell the whole story. There is a continuing evolution of aid modalities under way, as development financing for project-based activities is supplemented with macro-economic and sector-wide assistance targeted at promoting policy reforms, institutional change and capacity building. Several challenges will need to be met in the future: to increase funding for the MDBs by finance ministers; to 'green' private sector funds to ensure that investments made today do not pollute tomorrow; and to overcome the lack of a common reporting format by standardizing the collection and reporting of data on investments for energy.",1
"In this present study experimental investigation has been carried out to mitigate the NOx emission in 20% Annona biodiesel-diesel blend (A20) operated diesel engine by addition of antioxidant additives. The antioxidant additives used in the present study are p-phenylenediamine (PPDA), A-tocopherol acetate (AT) and L-ascorbic acid (LA). The addition of antioxidant additives to A20 blend did not cause and negative effect of properties of A20 blend. According to the test results, antioxidant additives are effective in controlling the Oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emission in diesel engine. Result shows that 250 mg concentration of PPDA additive with A20 blend was optimum for NOx mitigation up to 25.4% when compared to that of diesel without any major modification.

"This paper describes a new intermediate course given in the Environmental Studies Program at The New School. It incorporates research activities by the class as a whole, in the process of which the class learns a great deal about the science and technology of non-fossil fuels, their promises and difficulties. Since ameliorating human influenced global climate change, educating and training students in the skills necessary to accomplish the necessary transition is essential. The course embodies a class project on which everyone works, entitled Fueling America,whose purpose is to determine what technologies deployed in what manner and in what quantities can eliminate the use of fossil fuels in the United States by a date certain. Knowing that it was impossible, we nevertheless chose an early date, 2030, so that it seemed reachable for the students. The project resulted in a technical paper, which included an economic analysis. In addition to alternative energy technologies, the technologies of energy efficiencies were also included.",1
"Australia is undergoing an energy transition, largely spurred by efforts toward decarbonisation prompted by climate change. The energy transition, though, is socially and politically complex, particularly where the transition is felt most viscerally such as in resource-dependent regional communities. In this paper, I explore the social-political dimension of the energy transition in Australia by analysing a specific episode of social-political conflict: a multi-week, moving protest against a large thermal coal mine currently planned for development in Queensland, Australia, Adani Mining's Carmichael Coal Mine. The contestation was related to an 'Anti-Adani Convoy' that travelled from the southern-most state of Australia, Tasmania, to the regional Queensland community, Clermont, nearest the proposed mine site in mid-2019. The analysis is grounded in the social psychology tradition of the Social Identity Approach, and applies a model for exploring how social context makes salient certain identities and norms (the Situated Identity Enactment model). Social identity dimensions are explored via qualitative coding of online news media reporting on the Convoy, and from this analysis identity-based insights are drawn regarding the social-political dynamics of the energy transition in Australia. The Convoy experience indicates that regional communities are unlikely to be convinced about the need for the energy transition--or decarbonisation specifically and climate action more broadly--by advocates from afar who adopt tactics that appear as a threat to one group from another group. Instead, the energy transition will be best served by place-based, bottom-up initiatives that are congruent with local identity, values, preferences, and priorities.",1
"Diversifying the energy sources, and especially, capitalizing the available potential of energy production represents not only a challenge for developing countries, but it also requires active steps for Romania to achieve the required objectives imposed by the EU's renewable standards. Capitalizing the renewable energy sources can provide, in this context, a pertinent solution in reducing the national dependence of imported energy and also diversifying the supply. In this paper the renewable energy production in Romania during 1990-2007 was analyzed. Also a case study was presented, regarding the investment decision in energetic willow plantation as a possibility to increase and fulfil the EU renewable production quotas.",1
"Hybrid renewable energy systems (HRES) should be designed appropriately with an adequate combination of different renewable sources and various energy storage methods to overcome the problem of intermittency of renewable energy resources. A multi-criteria approach is proposed in this study to design an HRES including wind turbine, photovoltaic panels, fuel cell, electrolyser, hydrogen tank, and battery storage unit with an intermittent load. Three design criteria including loss of power supply probability, total energy loss (TEL), and the power difference between generation and storing capacity (as TELSUB) are taken into account in minimising the total cost of the system considering the interest rate and lifetime. The justifications and advantages of using these criteria are thoroughly discussed along with appropriate presentation of the results. The purpose of considering TEL and TELSUB is discussed thoroughly. The -constraint method is used to handle practical constraints of the proposed multi-criteria problem to construct a multi-objective fitness function. Shuffled frog leaping algorithm is implemented to achieve better optimal results. The proposed approach is implemented using real wind speed and solar irradiance data for a specific location with an intermittent load demand. The results verify performance of the proposed multi-criteria design procedure.",1
"The growing recognition of the contribution of urban areas to adaptation and mitigation strategies implemented in response to climate change has led to several policy initiatives. Among others, the Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy is the most acknowledged, providing local govemments with the opportunity to overcome the mitigation-adaptation dichotomy and enhance urban resilience. In this context, the main aim of this paper is to analyse the synergy between adaptation and mitigation actions in some European Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plans at an urban level. We will do this through: (1) the proposal of a novel classification model of climate change mitigation and adaptation measures, which will be capable of classifying, in a common way, the best practices carried out at an urban level; and (2) a comparison of the best climate change management practices carried out by two European countries (Italy and Spain). The classification model is based on three urban sectors: (1) Urban Adaptation and Health (UA&H), (2) Transport & Infrastructure (T&I), and (3) Energy (NRG). Urban management measures have been classified as soft (more focused on environmental information), gray (more focused on buildings), and green (more focused on nature-based solutions). The overall comparative analysis between Italy and Spain shows that in large and medium-sized Italian cities, mainly soft (52%) and green (28%) adaptation measures have been integrated into local energy-environmental planning in combination with mitigation actions. However, in both countries, decisions regarding the type of measures to be implemented are taken independently of the size of the city. This paper, in line with other research, highlights the importance of nature-based solutions as a first step in the integration process between adaptation and mitigation strategies at an urban level.",1
"In the context of economic globalization and the development of information networks, container liner transportation plays a crucial role in international trade. However, the inherent inflexibility of fixed schedules in liner operations poses challenges to the decarbonization of shipping and the stability of liner networks. Therefore, this paper focuses on the impact of port disruptions on route operations, develops a mixed integer nonlinear programming model considering fuel costs, recovery costs, and carbon emissions, and designs a hybrid evolutionary algorithm to solve the proposed model. The research findings indicate that scheduling strategies based on increased vessel speed, the adjustment of port calling sequences, and transshipment leasing after port skipping can effectively reduce the recovery costs after disruption events while meeting freight demand. When a disruption duration is less than 96 h, acceleration strategies and the adjustment of the port calling sequence are favorable choices. When the disruption duration exceeds 96 h, transshipment leasing after port skipping is a feasible solution to ensure the on-time delivery of cargo. The shifting of disrupted port position restricts the selection of scheduling strategies, particularly for ports located at the intersections of routes, which incur higher recovery costs. The implementation of carbon taxes affects the overall operating costs of liner companies, and an appropriate carbon tax level can constrain carbon emissions and ensure the sustainable development of the shipping industry.",1
"Social entrepreneurship encompasses entrepreneurial activities designed to tackle societal and environmental challenges. This paper introduces a capped call option model for sustainable insurance within the context of financing social enterprise green operations, emphasizing the adoption of renewable energy and the implementation of cap-and-trade mechanisms. Our focus is on an objective defined as a combined stakeholder equity function, reflecting sustainable insurance resulting from the social enterprise's green operations and stakeholder engagement to fulfill the goals of social entrepreneurship. The research reveals that increasing subsidies for the social enterprise embracing renewable energy enhances stakeholder equity and social enterprise equity while negatively impacting insurer equity. Additionally, as the social enterprise integrates advanced green technologies into production, the positive effect on stakeholder equity becomes more pronounced. Stringent regulatory caps, however, adversely affect both stakeholder equity and social enterprise equity. Moreover, the study highlights green loan subsidies as a mutually beneficial strategy, fostering positive outcomes for both the borrowing social enterprise and the fund-providing insurer. It emphasizes the need for policies prioritizing green subsidies to promote the adoption of renewable energy for enhanced equity under sustainable insurance.",1
"Over the past decade, state policies on renewable energy have been on the rise in the U.S., providing states with various options for encouraging the generation of renewable electricity. Two promising policies, the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) and the Mandatory Green Power Option (MGPO), have been implemented in many states but the evidence about their effectiveness is mixed. In this paper, we argue that recognizing the natural, social, and policy context under which MGPO and RPS are adopted is necessary in order to measure their true effectiveness. This is because the context rather than the policy might lead to positive outcomes and there is the possibility for sample bias. When controlling for the context in which the policies are implemented, we find that RPS has a negative impact on investments in renewable capacity. However, we find that investor-owned utilities seem to respond more positively to RPS mandates than publicly owned utilities. By contrast, MGPO appears to have a significant effect on installed renewable capacity for all utilities regardless of the context in which it is implemented. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

"In this era of digitalization where concepts like e-mobility have started evolving lead to an increase of electricity consumption further and to keep climate change of our planet under control, the pressure on power generation using renewable energy (RE) sources will definitely increase. RE plays a very important role in achieving India's optimum generation mix by 2029-30. As per Central Electricity Authority (CEA) about 25GW of solar energy has to be installed every year for optimum generation mix. The target to achieve 45% of RE mix in the power generation system will have huge technical, operational, planning, commercial and regulatory challenges concerning optimal utilization of infrastructure and keeping balance with other sources of energy. This paper discusses the issues concerning RE integration with existing conventional energy sources and deployment strategies. The paper also presents a case study for Chhattisgarh state (India) using available data points to rationalize how proper deployment strategy can enable the use of RE to meet the optimum generation mix and simultaneously reduce the financial burden on buying utility and consumers along with fulfilling the countries RE target.",1
"With the progress of society and technology, modern society advocates the establishment of economic and social development under the premise of protecting the environment through technological reform and progress. As the third large economic development hub in China, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region has a strong capacity for economic development. However, in recent years, the frequency of hazy climate in the Beijing-TianjinHebei region is increasing, and the contradiction between environment and development tends to be obvious. Carbon dioxide emission control in the region needs to be developed vigorously to ensure healthy economic and social development and to meet the goal of controllable carbon emission in the future. In order to study the factors influencing carbon emissions in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and the future emission trends, scientific and effective emission reduction suggestions are proposed. In this paper, we analyze the time and magnitude of carbon emission peaks in the Beijing Tianjin-Hebei region through the establishment of various scenarios. Firstly, the LMDI decomposition method is used to make a preliminary analysis of the contribution of carbon emission factors in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, and then the STIRPAT model is used to deteiniine the carbon emission influencing factors and their degree of influence. Through the comparison of different models, it is concluded that the best low-carbon economy can be achieved when the population, economic level and urbanization develop at a medium speed, while the technology level, industrial structure and energy structure develop at a strong high speed. Moreover, the results show that economic development does not necessarily lead to a large expansion of carbon emissions. As long as the technological level can be developed reasonably and efficiently, the coal consumption and the proportion of secondary production can be strongly reduced, the purpose of high-speed economic urban development and carbon emission control can be achieved at the same time.",1
"This paper aims to consolidate the work carried out in making base station (BS) green and energy efficient by integrating renewable energy sources (RES). Clean and green technologies are mandatory for reduction of carbon footprint in future cellular networks. RES, especially solar and wind, are emerging as a viable alternate to fossil fuel based energy, which is the main cause of climate pollution. With advances in technologies, renewable energy is making inroads into all sectors including information and communication technologies (ICT). The main contributors of energy consumption in ICT sector are 'data centers' and 'cellular networks'. In cellular networks the BS is the main consumer of energy, mostly powered by the utility and a diesel generator. This energy comes at a significant operating cost as well as the environmental cost in terms of harmful greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Recent research shows that powering BSs with renewable energy is technically feasible. Although installation cost of energy from non-renewable fuel is still lower than RES, optimized use of the two sources can yield the best results. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of resource management in cellular BSs powered by RES and an in-depth analysis of power consumption optimization in order to reduce both cost and GHGs. Renewable energy sources are not only feasible for a stand-alone or off-grid BSs, but also feasible for on grid BSs. This paper covers different aspects of optimization in cellular networks to provide reader with a holistic view of concepts, directions, and advancements in renewable energy based systems incorporated in cellular communications. Energy management strategies are studied in the realm of smart grids and other technologies, increasing the possibilities for energy efficiency further by employing schemes such as 'energy cooperation'. Finally, the paper supports the move towards green communication in order to contribute positively towards climate change.",1
"Capacity building is recognized as one of three means of implementation (MOI) within the Paris Agreement, along with finance and technology. There is a good reason for this, namely that all aspects of climate action require multiple forms of capacity. In fact, it could be argued that capacity is foundational even to the other two MOIs as advancing both finance and technology requires a variety of capacities across multiple specific contexts. The Global Stocktake (GST) recognized the importance of capacity building for the achievement of the Paris Agreement and included its assessment within its evaluation of progress. However, unlike the other two MOIs, no chapter within the IPCC AR6 explicitly attempts to synthesize the state of knowledge about capacity or capacity building for climate action, and coverage of capacity remains scattered across the report. In this commentary we briefly reflect on the coverage of capacity and capacity building in the IPCC's AR6 and develop some initial proposals for how knowledge about this key MOI could be better included in future assessment processes.",1
"Universities play a pivotal role in modern society and must lead the way in achieving energy efficiency, directly contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Like small towns in resource consumption and population mobility, many universities and research centers face significant challenges transitioning to renewable electricity systems. This study aims to (i) map the current scientific literature on renewable energy sources used by universities; (ii) discuss the drivers, barriers, and trends of implementing renewable energy; and (iii) establish a connection with the SDGs. More specifically, the authors conducted a systematic literature review based on three stages: (i) data collection, (ii) bibliometric analysis, and (iii) content analysis. Forty-two articles were obtained and defined as the studied sample. The findings of this review illuminate critical research themes, leading countries in renewable energy adoption, and the prevalent electricity sources, shedding light on the primary authors shaping the discourse. Wind and solar energy exhibit a notable growth trajectory, offering environmentally friendly alternatives compared to conventional sources. Furthermore, it is essential to highlight that the distribution of research documents in the sample is uneven, with a predominant concentration in European countries. Additionally, the study identifies the field's key drivers, barriers, and emergent trends. The theoretical contributions encompass a comprehensive compilation of renewable energy sources, discernible research trajectories, and strategies to navigate obstacles. In practical terms, this work offers valuable insights for the selection of energy sources and stakeholder engagement, facilitating informed decision-making processes. This article's novelty lies in its holistic examination of renewable energy adoption in university settings, providing a comprehensive overview of the current landscape and actionable insights for stakeholders seeking sustainable energy solutions within these institutions. This aligns with multiple SDGs, including Goal 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), and Goal 13 (Climate Action), underscoring the critical role of universities in driving sustainable development.",1
An agreed system is needed to settle disputes over how much funding richer countries are providing to poorer nations for green projects.,1
The U.S. Department of Energy's National Energy Technology Laboratory is pursuing a new integrated energy-water R&D program that addresses water management issues relative to coal-fired power generation that takes into account the major impacts of CCS on water use. The goal of this research is to promote more efficient use of water in power plant operations and increase the availability of heretofore unusable waters for power plant use. Those practices can mitigate the impacts of CCS on power plant water use and allow for continued development of energy resources.,1
"Hydrogen is acknowledged as a potential fuel as it can be used as an energy carrier, a storage medium, in fuel cells and as a fuel as well and offers carbon-free solutions. This paper investigates three renewable energy based configurations for hydrogen production. The renewable energy sources considered in this study are solar PV, geothermal power generation and biomass gasification. The proposed study also presents a novel configuration of biomass gasification for hydrogen production via multistage water gas shift reactors. The solar PV and geothermal energy based hydrogen production systems are analysed employing the EES software while the hydrogen production system employing biomass gasification is simulated employing Aspen Plus. All three designed configurations are proceeded through numerous parametric analyses to investigate the system behavior and effect on system efficiencies. The hydrogen production using biomass gasification technique provides with the energetic and exergetic efficiencies of 53.6% and 49.8% and the efficiencies for the geothermal power generation based hydrogen production system are found to be 10.4% and 10.2% respectively. The exergetic and energetic efficiencies of hydrogen production system employing solar PV system are found to be 17.45% and 16.95%, respectively and the system is designed to produce 1.13 mol/s of hydrogen. Furthermore, the results of the parametric studies and sensitivity analyses are presented and discussed.",1
"Given the substantial financial requirements, greening the capital-intensive based infrastructure like transport requires pondering upon new innovative strategies. As the public sector has demonstrated a lack of sufficient funds in numerous instances, promoting the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) has become a promising pathway toward green transportation. However, the role that PPP investments in the transportation sector in reducing transport CO2 emissions (TCO2e) on the road to meeting the sustainable development goals (SDGs) has received minimal attention. In this context, this study investigates the impact of PPP in the transportation sector and renewable energy on TCO2e for Mexico from 1990 to 2022, while controlling economic and urban settlement growth. For a novel attempt, this study leverages several modern econometric methodologies, such as the Augmented and Dynamic ARDL which allows estimating long-run and short-run elasticities vis-`a-vis future scenario analysis. Results divulge that the PPP in transport curbs TCO2e over the short term, but the long-term effect is insignificant. Moreover, findings uncover that while the usage of renewable energy strengthens environmental circumstances, a rise in the urban population has a short-term negative impact on TCO2e. Moreover, the economic progress boosts Mexico's TCO2e and has a more devastating long-term effect, which is contradictory to the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis. The current study suggests that in order to advance the nation's green transportation system, authorities in Mexico should implement several measures to increase the pie of renewable energy and effective public-private partnership investment in the transportation sector.",1
"High reliance on non-renewable energy sources is a commonly-cited driver of increased income inequality. This study hypothesizes renewable energy can alleviate this issue due to its ability to replace non-renewable energy. This paper uses panel data of 10 rich natural resources countries in Asia for a sample period of 1996-2020. The Dynamic Common Correlated Effects model is employed. This study discovers natural resources dependence causes income inequality to widen. Furthermore, renewable energy significantly moderates the unfavourable impacts of natural resource dependence on income inequality. This study recommends the establishment of more captive renewable energy power plants in India, Pakistan, Malaysia, Mongolia, and Vietnam. This study also proposes the creation of Sovereign Wealth Funds which are dedicated to establishing renewable energy ecosystems in Bangladesh, China, Indonesia, and Thailand.",1
"According to the population growth, the energy demand has grown rapidly. Besides these, economic and technological improvement demands more energy utilization. But the world's treasured energies are limited. It is also important that more uses of conventional energy resources create a huge greenhouse gas which have an adverse effect on global ecosystem. But without energy, modernization of our civilization is quite impossible. So, to save our planet, we have to choose some alternative resources of energy. That alternative energy sources should be renewable and sustainable. In this world we can find different types of renewable energy in different geographical position. The main advantages of renewable energy are that, it has a little effect on ecosystem, it can be collected even in bad weather condition and overall it is a weapon to fight against environmental pollution. It has a great influence on economic growth, job creation and energy security. But there are some problems in storing of renewable energy. Scientists and investors are continuously trying to overcome this problem. Sometime, protest from common people during the installation of renewable energy set up, make the situation difficult. Employment opportunities and some facilities reduce the protest against the application of sustainable energy. Public education and awareness on renewable energy helps the policymaker to make decisions. From study of review papers about the renewable energy it is found that a massive experiment is going on sustainable energy. This paper has established an idea about different renewable energy application, their difficulties of application and their solution. It is also observed that with rising government strategy to reduce carbon emission for economic growth and with proper technique and storage arrangement, the renewable energy application will significantly expand in few years.",1
"This article illustrates a green energy technology for power generation using cow urine. The aim of this research is to design and analysis with chemical and physical model of a low-cost, chamber-based power plant to harvest electricity from cow urine. The proposed model works like a conventional battery system. However, a discharged battery needs to recharge by electricity in order to reactivate it. On the other hand, cow urine-based system needs only to replace old urine by fresh one to reactivate the system. As no electricity is required for charging the system, the daily available fresh urine from a dairy farm could be a possible source of renewable energy. A small scale prototype power plant based on cow urine is established in a dairy farm located in the suburb of Dhaka city in Bangladesh to investigate the performance and feasibility of the proposed system.",1
"This paper looks into the possible methods of harvesting energy for applications involving wireless sensors from renewable or sustainable sources. An overview of the fundamentals of energy harvesting models using renewable sources and the advancements in the components used for this purpose is given. It also provides an analysis of the issues that are restricting the current harvesting models and indicates possible advances in technologies that may soon solve those problems. There are two main issues that plague these harvesting models. Firstly, the technology involved in the actual harvesting of renewable energy sources is not well developed and offer poor efficiency. In addition to that, most of the models need a permanent storage device, such as a battery or capacitor in order to operate. This is a serious drawback in applications involving wireless sensors as these devices have limited capacity, lifetime, and require a large area to work efficiently. This is most often not favorable as the attractions of using wireless sensors are in its portability and form. This paper looks into the studies dedicated to solving these problems. The latter part of the paper contains a discussion regarding the technologies that are best suited for applications in wireless sensors. The two most readily available and feasible options of a sustainable energy for these applications are found out to be RF (Radio Frequency) signal and solar radiation. Therefore, the final part of the paper concentrates on reviewing a model that may potentially be able to serve as a basis for a singular model for any kind of energy harvesting from renewable sources.

"Carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases from fossil fuel use in many developed and developing countries are expected to be the major source of anthropogenic emissions for the foreseeable future. As a result, the potential to use CO2 capture and storage (CCS) for significant reductions in CO2 emissions from the use of coal (and other fossil fuels) at large point sources could become very important in determining the feasibility of climate change mitigation. Large-scale deployment of CCS in the EU from 2020 has been suggested, but this paper illustrates how time is very short if two complete learning cycles are to be achieved before a possible rollout in the early/mid 2020s. It also highlights some key differences between CO2 capture technologies that suggest that learning can be achieved more quickly with post-combustion capture than with other options. This might allow rollout to be accelerated by perhaps 5 years for post-combustion capture. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",1
"Carbon capture (CC), along with the efforts to reduce carbon emissions at the source, is a major action toward the mitigation of climate change and global warming due to emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs). Carbon emissions amount to 36.3 Gt-CO2 in 2021 from 31.5 Gt-CO2 in 2022, with a drop of about 1.5 Gt-CO2 in 2020 relative to 2019 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The carbon emissions originate from heat and power, transportation, process industries, and residential activities constitute 47.7, 24.9, 18.9, and 8.5% of the total emissions, respectively. The process industries represent the second large-scale point-source of carbon emissions next to heat and power. Additionally, the process industries have high-intensity carbon emissions up to 0.6-0.8 t-CO2/tcement, 1.4-2 t-CO2/t-steel, and 2.7-99.2 kg CO2/bbl, with flue gas streams having high CO2 concentration up to 30%. In comparison to 0.4 t-CO2/MWh and 3-16% CO2 in the flue gas from heat and power facilities, these process industries present a highly effective target for CC application. This work reviews and critically discusses the large-scale application of CC to different process industries, namely, cement, iron and steel, oil refinery, and chemicals. CC can be achieved by three main approaches, i.e., post-combustion, pre-combustion, and oxyfuel combustion. Post-combustion and chemical-looping are the common CC approaches utilized in process industries, with the first being widely applied due to its ease of incorporation, and the latter is commonly used in the cement industry. CC with the capacity in the range of 0.4-2 Mt-CO2/yr is planned for cement plants relative to current capacities of 75 kt-CO2/yr. Similarly, CC capacity up to 0.8 Mt-CO2/yr has been integrated into iron and steel plants, in which captured CO2 is utilized for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) applications. In the oil and gas industry, CC has been widely utilized, in the context of gas purification, being an essential gas processing unit, with CC capacities up to 1.4 Mt-CO2/yr, and plans to reach 4 Mt-CO2/yr. CC cost is the main challenge for the widespread implementation of CC in process industries with a wide range of reported costs of USD9.8-250/tCO2 depending on the process industry and the CC technology used.",1
"Besides bringing countries closer, the effects of globalization can help increase the production of goods and services, and foster economic growth. Foreign direct investment (FDI) is one of the processes of globalization. One aspect of globalization that has piqued the interest of economists, is the transfer of polluting industries between countries. A principal factor in this are discrepancies of environmental regulations, and these have also been instrumental in a failure to control pollution worldwide. With this impasse in mind, a Panel Autoregressive Distributed Lag was applied to evaluate the impacts of FDI on the carbon dioxide emissions of 21 countries divided by income level, for a period from 2001 to 2017. This methodology allowed the analysis of the resulting dynamics of pollution into the short-run and long-run. The characteristics of efficiency, innovation, and regulation are crucial to better understand the consequences of flows in FDI. Regulation seems to increase pollution in high-income countries, which merits further discussion. FDI decreases emissions in high-income countries, while increasing them in the short-run in middle-income countries, which supports the Pollution Haven Hypothesis. Nonetheless, the capacity of middle-income countries to absorb technology is crucial for them to benefit in the long-run. Trade openness is also highly influenced by environmental regulation in middle-income countries. Since our aim is to understand the transfer of polluting industries, an analysis of emissions from the industrial sector provided a robustness check. It also revealed that policymakers do not seem to be paying sufficient attention to innovation and controlling the environmental degradation that this sector causes. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

"The rewetting of drained peatlands is currently a common practice for re-establishing near-natural hydrological conditions and for reducing peatland greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, especially of carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O), which are enhanced under peatland drainage and extraction. In the originally bare and drained peatland Himmelmoor (Quickborn, Germany), the rewetting process started stepwise in 2004 by blocking drainage ditches with peat as well as by creating polders surrounded by peat dams. In this research we examined differences in CO2, methane (CH4) and N2O emissions between a flooded (FL) area, a bare peat dam (PD) area and an abandoned (but still drained) extraction (E) area during a period in 2012 and during a period of two years in 2014-2016. The results showed that all study areas were GHG sources, although large differences were identified between the different sites. Winter CO2 emissions from all sites (FL, PD, E) were within the range previously reported for rewetted peatlands, but summer CO2 emissions from PD (1-20 mu mol m(-1) s(-1)) strongly exceeded the reported average range for similar surfaces. Very low and irregular CH4 fluxes were detected at both PD and FL, ranging from -6 to 24 nmol m(-2) s(-1) at PD and from -13 to 49 nmol m(-2) s(-1) at FL. In comparison to other peatlands, the observed N2O emissions were high, especially at the PD sites with maximum daily means of 23 nmol m(-2)s(-1) in the summer of 2012. In general, the flooded excavation sites (FL) showed lower GHG emissions than the not-rewetted excavation area (E). Also, despite the relatively small coverage of the peat dams (PD), these areas showed a larger total GHG emission than the E and FL sites. This negative effect of peat dams during the first years after flooding could be mitigated by stimulating their colonisation by moss or heath vegetation, which reduces the soil N pool and thus can be expected to reduce N2O fluxes from the peat dams.",1
"The IPCC's report on Global Warming of 1.5 degrees C positioned climate change as one of the most worrying issues mankind has ever faced. Although many people worry about climate change, there is still much unknown about the origins and outcomes of worry about climate change; particularly, whether and how it can motivate specific and personal climate actions. The current paper investigates this critical relationship with data from the European Social Survey Round 8 (44,387 respondents from 23 countries). As expected, the more individuals worried about climate change, the more likely they were to take and support climate action. Yet, the process through which this association occurred differed between actions. Specifically, worry was both directly and indirectly, via feelings of personal responsibility to reduce climate change, associated with climate policy support; whereas worry was mostly indirectly associated with personal climate mitigation behaviours, via personal responsibility. In addition, worry about climate change appears partly rooted in biospheric values (i.e., caring about nature and the environment), and biospheric values were also clearly, directly and positively related to personal climate mitigation behaviours. The relationships were highly consistent across countries but varied somewhat in size. The results show how generic feelings about climate change can directly and indirectly affect both climate policy support and personal climate mitigation behaviours, thereby providing critical insights for science and policy making.",0
"Intelligent scheduling of urban drainage systems is generally regarded as a potentially sustainable strategy for urban flood management. To investigate the effectiveness of the intelligent scheduling strategy in mitigating urban flooding, a new intelligent scheduling model (ISM) that couples the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) and a multiobjective particle swarm optimization algorithm is proposed for a simulation-optimization framework. The objectives of the ISM are to minimize the flooding volume, front-pool water level fluctuation, and operational cost. Synthetic rainfall events with different durations and return periods based on the Gumbel distribution and observed rainfall events are utilized to comprehensively assess the designed model's performance in the Dealim3 catchment, South Korea. The selected ISM-based scheduling strategies are assessed in accordance with climate change mitigation (i.e., reducing greenhouse gas emissions) and local adaptation strategies (i.e., improving drainage systems). The results indicate that these strategies generated by ISM lead to reductions in flooding, water level fluctuation, and operational costs. The maximum daily rainfall with a 100-year return period increased by 2.1% and 6.8% during 2025-2064 under SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5, respectively, compared with the historical period (1975-2014), thereby increasing the magnitude of urban flooding. The ISM may also significantly lower the flooding process at specific nodes. The ISM-based strategy outperforms climate change mitigation and other adaptation strategies. This study shows that the ISM-based strategy are very useful to deal with the impact of climate change on urban flooding.",1
"The increased use of renewable energy is imperative as a countermeasure to climate change. As with conventional electricity generation technologies, public acceptance of renewables is an important issue, and willingness to pay (WTP) is a widely used indicator to assess such public attitudes. Unfortunately, the literature to date mostly covers developed countries, with few WTP surveys in developing countries. Tackling climate change is an urgent issue for these developing countries; therefore, understanding of public attitudes toward renewables in developing countries is crucial. This study conducted the first survey on WTP for introducing renewable energy in Myanmar. Although Myanmar boasts abundant renewable energy resources, including solar power and biomass in addition to large-scale hydro plants, its resources are not being properly utilized to generate electricity. This study surveyed WTP for power generation by solar photovoltaics, small hydropower, and biomass facilities. The results showed the highest WTP for solar power (USD 1.92) with 10% share in the energy mix, and lower WTP for biomass and small hydropower electricity generations (USD 1.13 and USD 1.17, respectively). Careful public communication is thus crucial for expanding biomass and small-scale hydro power plants.",1
"Meeting the Paris Agreement targets requires deep emissions reductions supported by a scale-up in carbon dioxide removal. However, current country-reported mitigation pledges are off track to meet carbon dioxide removal needs, unless countries dramatically reduce emissions consistent with low-energy-demand scenarios. Prioritize reducing emissions rapidly across all sectors (including from deforestation and land degradation) to minimize dependency on CDR.Report planned emissions reductions and removals separately in the nationally determined contributions and long-term strategies, while acknowledging the difficulty of isolating only direct anthropogenic effects in country reporting.Focus on policies that incentivize further removals on land, support afforestation, and improve forest management and gains in soil carbon, while protecting ecosystems and biodiversity.Develop plans to mitigate future risks for removals on land, including the impacts of climate change (such as wildfires) and changes in indirect anthropogenic effects (such as carbon dioxide fertilization).Close the CDR gap by designing 'technology push' and 'demand pull' policies that promote the innovation, development and upscaling of energy-efficient, scalable, cost-effective novel CDR technologies.",1
"The introduction of energy storage technologies to the grid could enable greater integration of renewables, improve system resilience and reliability, and offer cost effective alternatives to transmission and distribution upgrades. The integration of energy storage systems into the electrical grid can lead to different environmental outcomes based on the grid application, the existing generation mix, and the demand. Given this complexity, a framework is needed to systematically inform design and technology selection about the environmental impacts that emerge when considering energy storage options to improve sustainability performance of the grid. To achieve this, 12 fundamental principles specific to the design and grid application of energy storage systems are developed to inform policy makers, designers, and operators. The principles are grouped into three categories: (1) system integration for grid applications, (2) the maintenance and operation of energy storage, and (3) the design of energy storage systems. We illustrate the application of each principle through examples published in the academic literature, illustrative calculations, and a case study with an off-grid application of vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs). In addition, trade-offs that can emerge between principles are highlighted.",1
"The land use sector currently represents similar to 25% of the global greenhouse gas emissions, thus this human activity is having a huge impact on climate change. Semi-arid climate areas, which are widely distributed, are particularly influenced by such climate change. In these areas, land use changes have transformed the entire landscape and increased the greenhouse gas emissions. However, in semi-arid climate areas, the information on the effect of climate change is scarce and usually centred on one single type of land use. For the land uses (forest, agricultural and agroforestry) traditionally found in the semi-arid area in South Portugal, this study aimed to evaluate (i) the soil chemical (pH) and physical properties (bulk density and percentage of different soil aggregate fractions: 250-2000; 53-250 and < 53 mu m) and (ii) the carbon (C) storage in whole soil and each soil aggregate fraction in land with over 100 years of the same use. The results show that after > 100 years with the same land use, C storage in the whole soil was similar in the plots with extensive agriculture based on the agroecology principles to that in the agroforestry plots. However, the concentration and storage of C in the microaggregates (53-250 mu m) and the silt + clay soil fraction (< 53 mu m) were generally higher for the forest and agroforestry land uses than for the agricultural land use due to the tree effect. This C associated with the smallest soil fractions is very stable and is retained in the soil in the long term. In this context, agroforestry systems improve the soil C storage in the long term at the same time that agricultural production is allowed compared to the traditional forest systems. Therefore, the establishment and maintenance of agroforestry systems in the semi-arid climate areas is a sustainable land use for climate change mitigation.",1
"Membrane processes have been investigated for carbon capture for more than four decades. Important efforts have been more recently achieved for the development of advanced materials and, to a lesser extent, on process engineering studies. A state-of-the-art analysis is proposed with a critical comparison to gas absorption technology, which is still considered as the best available technology for this application. The possibilities offered by high-performance membrane materials (zeolites, Carbon Molecular Sieves, Metal Oxide Frameworks, graphenes, facilitated transport membranes, etc.) are discussed in combination to process strategies (multistage design, hybrid processes, energy integration). The future challenges and open questions of membranes for carbon capture are finally proposed.",1
"The production of woodchips in short rotation coppices (SRC) presents a new market opportunity, which is strengthened by both the EU agricultural policy and the European emission trading system This market will grow substantially in the next few decades Woodchips can substitute for fossil fuel to generate heat and power as well as provide car fuels from biomass The SRC market will interfere with both the food and feed markets Farmers and other stakeholders in the woodchip market have to decide whether to go for the SRC option or not Examples from Sweden and Germany show how different stakeholders along the production line including end-users and financial institutions value chances and risks in the SRC market. The assumption that SRC is an environmentally friendly and economically promising option that can contribute to climate change mitigation (for example Pieprzyk, 2009) is lacking scientific evidence and reliable data An assessment on the total impact(s) to the environment and society is thus needed in this paper research concepts are reviewed for a comprehensive analysis outlining a research agenda to evaluate SRC markets. One result of the review is that socio-economic research in SRC requires transdisciplinary work integrating the fields of ecology, technology, business studies, and economics with innovation, stakeholders' involvement, and societal impacts on regional economies",1
"More efficient use of renewable energy to reduce carbon emission requires a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of renewable energy on carbon emissions. To this end, this work investigates the linear and nonlinear relationship between renewable energy consumption and carbon emissions in 130 countries from the new perspective of resource capital factors (total natural resources rents) and human capital (human capital index). The results are given that from a global perspective, the increase in the proportion of renewable energy consumption can accelerate the reduction of per capita carbon emissions before reaching a particular threshold value of total natural resources rents. When a specific natural threshold value is reached, the increase in the proportion of renewable energy consumption will reduce the rate of per capita carbon emissions. Another interesting finding is that the greater the human factor, the lower the reduction rate of per capita carbon dioxide emissions. To explain the above phenomenon, all countries are divided into four different income levels for further heterogeneity research. When the threshold variables are different, the impact on carbon emissions in various income countries is heterogeneous, which is further analyzed in the article. Furthermore, a meaningful discovery shows that whether the threshold variable is natural or human factor, low-income countries benefit the most from the carbon reduction effect brought by the increase in the proportion of renewable energy consumption, followed by lower-middle income and upper-middle income countries, and the lowest is higher-income countries.",1
"Modern power systems are incorporated with distributed energy sources to be environmental-friendly and cost-effective. However, due to the uncertainties of the system integrated with renewable energy sources, effective strategies need to be adopted to stabilize the entire power systems. Hence, the system operators need accurate prediction tools to forecast the dynamic system states effectively. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian deep learning approach to predict the dynamic system state in a general power system. First, the input system dataset with multiple system features requires the data pre-processing stage. Second, we obtain the dynamic state matrix of a general power system through the Newton-Raphson power flow model. Third, by incorporating the state matrix with the system features, we propose a Bayesian long short-term memory (BLSTM) network to predict the dynamic system state variables accurately. Simulation results show that the accurate prediction can be achieved at different scales of power systems through the proposed Bayesian deep learning approach.",0
"The production of synthetic natural gas (SNG) to store renewable energy in a chemical energy carrier can be accomplished basically through three main production pathways: the biochemical (biogas upgrade), thermochemical (gasification and synthesis gas upgrade) and electrochemical ('Power-to-Gas') pathway. The technologies applied in these concepts are described and the three pathways are compared in terms of their state of development, efficiencies, and economics. While the biochemical pathway is already established on a commercial scale, the thermochemical and electrochemical routes are still in the pilot-plant phase. Biochemical production of SNG reaches efficiencies in the range of 55-57% but with a potential of above 80%. In comparison, higher efficiencies of up to 70% for the thermochemical pathway are currently expected, with future improvement up to 75%. Electrochemical production achieves efficiencies in the range of 54-60% with expected potential up to 78%. Therefore at the moment the highest efficiencies are given for the thermochemical pathway followed by the electrochemical and biochemical pathways. Economic evaluation is done by comparing specific production costs as well as mean specific investment costs for SNG. Generally speaking, specific production and investment costs decrease with time horizon and increasing scale of the plant. Specific production cost levels in (sic)ct/kWh(SNG) vary between 5.9 and 13.7 (biochemical), 5.6 and 37 (thermochemical), and 8.2 and 93 (electrochemical). Thus, none of the concepts can compete with today's natural gas prices, but all options are able to provide valuable assistance for a sustainable transition of the energy system.

"Based on the dual legitimacy theory, this study combined the institutional theory with the adaptive legitimacy theory to explore the external factors affecting enterprise ESER behaviors, and examined the internal factors affecting ESER behaviors of enterprises based on the strategic legitimacy theory and the upper echelons theory. The data of 5389 listed companies in China during 2008 and 2018 were used. We collected secondary data from the China Research Data Service Platform (CNRDS) and RESSET database. The logit model and ordered logit model were used to analyze the data. Results showed that different factors had different effects on an enterprise's different ESER behaviors. For example, market factors could significantly affect a variety of ESER behaviors of enterprises, while media attention could only significantly reduce the probability of pollutant emission of enterprises. Green technology reserve has a significant and positive effect on several ESER behaviors; while financial slack promotes environmentally beneficial products and green office but inhibits other ESER behaviors. At last, the proportion of females in the senior management team positively influences company's ESER behaviors. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
"Organizations across the globe are devising novel approaches to strive for carbon neutrality. Global institutions have manifested the critical need to develop reasonable strategies in every sector to mitigate the impending issues of excessive anthropogenic carbon emission and, in consequence, climate change. World-leading economies have initiated significant steps by developing zero-carbon emission policies to monitor the escalating carbon emissions to curb global warming. The clothing industry has a substantial carbon footprint while causing environmental pollution. Based on transition management theory, this study aims to explore and evaluate the critical determinants that can assist in pursuing carbon neutrality in the clothing industry. A decision support system comprising an integrated voting analytical hierarchy process (VAHP) and Bayesian network (BN) method fulfills our purpose. Pertinent literature is reviewed to determine the critical determinants for carbon neutrality (CDs-CN). After that, the VAHP method is employed to prioritize the CDs-CN. Further, the influence of CDs-CN on achieving carbon neutrality is modeled using a BN, predicting the carbon neutrality index (CNI) for the clothing industry. The findings reveal that professional expertise, laws and certifications, technological acceptance, availability of decarbonizing methods, and adequate carbon offsetting are the essential CDs-CN. This research extends the existing knowledge on integrating MCDM-ML techniques to address predictive modelling-based problems involving complex structures. Simultaneously, the present study helps practitioners and policymakers understand the key CDs-CN to successfully build and manage a carbon-neutral clothing industry by adopting the suggested strategies. Finally, recommendations concerning sustainable development goals (SDGs) are provided to achieve carbon-neutral manufacturing supply chains.",1
"The European Commission and EU Member States have recently promoted legislation (under the REPower EU Plan) to accelerate renewable energy projects by allowing the elimination or reduction of environmental assessment and public participation in the approval procedure. To avoid adverse effects on the environment, these regulations propose the exclusion of certain areas (identified through available information on protected and/or environmentally sensitive areas) from the procedure. This paper aims to evaluate whether such measures are effective to avoid damage to biodiversity from the implementation of photovoltaic energy. To this end, we studied the distribution and abundance of a threatened bird species, the Black-bellied Sandgrouse, at two geographic scales: i) regional: Andalusia (southern Spain); ii) local: Campo de Tabernas (an excellent example of the semi-arid ecosystems of southeastern Spain) and evaluated the quality of the information that Administrations have on the species by comparing it with own censuses. We also assessed the effectiveness of the environmental impact procedure for photovoltaic plants planned in Campo de Tabernas. Data from the regional Administration reveal that Andalusian protected areas cover a minimal part (17.7%) of the species' range. Moreover, neither the regional nor the national Administration have reliable and updated information on the distribution of the species in Campo de Tabernas (only 17% of the current distribution area is known). The wrong choices made by developers about where to locate the photovoltaic plants together with wrong decisions of the regional Administration (with land-use planning competences, including the planning of power plant locations) have led to the loss of 630 ha of the species' range in Campo de Tabernas. Public participation of experts prevents, through allegations to the projects, an important part of the impact on the species. Policy implications: the information that the Administrations have on this species does not allow them to make proper decisions on where to apply renewable acceleration. Obtaining complete and updated information on the distribution of endangered species to elaborate detailed wildlife sensitivity areas is essential and urgent before implementing measures to accelerate renewables.",0
"The purpose of this investigation is to summarize modular facade construction using renewable energy features in different aspects. Researches done so far primarily focusing on building envelop have shown various constructions of building enclosure without energy usage. This paper mainly focuses on modular facade renovation system programmes of European Horizon 2020 [] and IEA ECBCS Annex 50 Prefabricated Systems for Low Energy Renovation of Residential Buildings in terms of construction, material, installation and thermal performance. Four aspects of construction, material, installation and thermal performance are adopted to evaluate these practices. Related website, paper and report from European commission constitute the database providing for review. Final results illustrate that all modular facade systems mentioned above could be classified into three layers: interior; module and exterior layer, taking charge of disparate functions. Both insulation and energy usage achieve the innovative envelop constructions manufacture. Integrating the renewable energy resources utilization technique into insulated building facade system is the core of this innovative projects achievement.",1
"Carbon pricing policies face growing threats from populist attacks citing increased costs for consumers. This paper explores the potential for different strategies to protect carbon pricing policies from these attacks through an in-depth analysis of the enactment and subsequent reversal of an economy-wide cap-and-trade programme in Ontario, Canada, from 2015 to 2018. The paper uses process tracing of key government documents, media coverage, and interviews with those involved in the enactment and promotion of the policy, to answer two questions: (1) why did Ontario choose a carbon revenue approach focused on economic development and climate mitigation? and (2) how did that approach make the policy more vulnerable to a populist attack based on higher consumer prices? The analysis tests a central hypothesis grounded in previous research: A failure to focus more on consumer costs in designing and promoting the cap-and-trade progamme is a primary reason for the Ontario policy's startling political failure. In this respect, the paper concludes, Ontario's experience constitutes a warning about the importance of designing and framing carbon pricing policies to defuse the potential power of populist attacks focusing on energy prices for 'working families'. Key policy insights Carbon pricing policies remain vulnerable to populist attacks based on opposition to higher consumer prices. Dedicating carbon revenue to interest groups may undermine the ability to defend the policy against consumer pricing attacks. Carefully explaining a cap-and-trade policy mechanism can be important to building public support for the policy. Neither its complexity nor its integration with international carbon markets protected Ontario's cap-and-trade programme from repeal. Ontario's cap-and-trade policy's repeal can be substantially attributed to the government's approach to allocating carbon revenue.",1
"Climate change is one of the greatest problems the Earth is currently facing, and efforts to alleviate its effects are most often carried out within the framework of two main strategies: mitigation and adaptation. Both of these strategies are necessary for today's urban planning processes, and it is therefore important that they are considered together. However, there may be conflicts if urban spatial decisions support one strategy while having adverse effects on the other. This contradiction between mitigation and adaptation then raises the question of which one of two conflicting strategies is more important for the urban spatial development of a given city. This paper aims to determine whether a city should give priority to mitigation or adaptation by examining the spatial development dynamics. These strategies have prioritized for urban built-up areas in the case of Turkey's central cities. According to the long-term results, 23 out of 81 Turkish central cities were identified as mitigation-priority, 43 as adaptation-priority, and 15 as equal-weighted. It is hoped that the method used in this paper will be useful for cities in developing countries which have not yet prepared a local climate policy or urban climate action plan.",1
"This paper describes Phase I of the World Bank Group's (WBG) technical assistance project for the development of carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) in Mexico. Phase I was concluded in early 2016 and saw the completion of three studies: 1. A pre-feasibility study of a proposed post-combustion capture (PCC) pilot plant at a natural gas-fired combined-cycle (NGCC) power plant in Mexico. This study, carried out by NEXANT Inc. under a consultant's assignment from the WBG, included a comparative techno-economic evaluation of six advanced amine-based PCC technologies and a generic amine-based conceptual pilot plant design. 2. A review of state-of-the-art practices related to combining carbon dioxide-enhanced oil recovery (CO2-EOR) with geological storage of CO2 in Mexico. Specifically, this review, conducted by the Battelle Memorial Institute under a consultant's assignment from the WBG, assessed the requirements a CO2-EOR project must satisfy in order to qualify as a permanent storage project and earn carbon credits. 3. A study of the development of a CCUS regulatory framework for Mexico. This study, prepared by Milieu Ltd. under a consultant's assignment from the WBG, undertook a comprehensive and in-depth assessment of the current regulatory framework in Mexico as it pertains to CCUS, identified critical gaps and barriers that are expected to impede the development and implementation of CCUS, and made a series of recommendations for overcoming these and barriers. These three studies, funded by the WBG administered Trust Fund for Carbon Capture and Storage Capacity Building in Developing Countries (WB CCS TF), form the foundation for further work and will benefit the implementation of the planned pilot projects. The subject studies were also important for building capacity, increasing the awareness of CCUS among the various stakeholders in CCUS and building up their capacity, in line with the objectives of the WB CCS TF.

"The current agri-food systems are unable to fulfill global demand and account for 33% of all greenhouse gas emissions. Conventional agriculture cannot produce more food because of the scarcity of arable land, the depletion of freshwater resources, and the increase in greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, it is important to investigate alternate farming methods. Algae farming is a feasible alternative that produces food, feed, and feedstock using wastelands and unconventional agricultural settings such as coastal regions, salt-affected soils, and urban/peri-urban environments. This review focuses on three emerging scenarios. First is seawater, which makes up 97.5% of the water on Earth. However, it is nevertheless used less often than freshwater. Second is a growing trend of people moving from rural to urban regions for improved employment prospects, living standards, and business chances. However, most rural migrants are essentially skilled in agriculture, which limits their applicability in metropolitan environments. The third scenario focuses on excellent crop yields and soil fertility; it is essential to maintain appropriate levels of organic matter and soil structure. In this case, algae have remarkable potential for osmoregulation-based salt tolerance and may provide valuable metabolites when cultivated in brackish or saltwater. Using brackish water, treated wastewater, and saltwater, algal culture systems may be established in arid/semi-arid, urban/peri-urban, and coastal areas to fulfill the increasing need for food, feed, and industrial feedstocks. It may also provide migrants from rural areas with work possibilities, which would allay environmental footprints.",1
"Energy audits of buildings are the most effective tool to promote energy retrofitting measures for existing buildings, which are major consumers of energy in cities. Energy audits have multiple goals, including reducing energy consumption, managing costs, and environmental impact. The methodology of Green Energy Audit proposed defines an approach that is somewhat different from the traditional one. The added value lies in the word green, a word that refers to and summarises a common concept: sustainability. The proposed method is not intended to be a new energy auditing procedure, but rather a new and more modern interpretation of the classic methodology. The sustainability achieved by applying a retrofit measure is assessed with reference to the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Protocol. The Green Energy Audit integrates two strategic elements, energy and environment, by mixing the energy audit and LEED methodologies. This synergy strengthens the role of the classic energy audit by providing a method that not only optimise the energy performance of existing buildings but also achieve a green retrofit of buildings, making buildings, and so future cities, more sustainable. A case study of the application of this method is discussed in this paper. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",1
"Renewable energy (RE) technologies are increasingly viewed as critically important since the noticeable depletion of fossil fuel. Knowledge that facilitates forecasting the likely growth and consequences of emergent technologies is essential for well-informed technology management. Acquiring and analyzing such knowledge is hampered by the amount of data available in publications. In order to elucidate the advance of technologies, we want to address questions like: How many scientific articles have been published in solar energy recently? Intelligent search techniques capable of grouping semantically similar concepts are therefore needed, such that e. g. the term parabolic trough is subsumed under solar energy related technologies and hence articles about it should be included in the analysis. The novelty of this work is the deployment of a large, high quality RE-taxonomy for comprehensive trend discovery in publications and patents. We report interesting trends of renewables in two case studies: power generation and desalination techniques. While all major renewables-except geothermal-recently boomed in power generation in terms of publication volume, leading to a nearly equibalanced diversification, patents only reflect strong growth for wind and solar. Renewables in desalination, in particular reverse osmosis, are mainly solar and wind with a slight upward trend of biofuels in publications, hereas other renewables are still in experimental stage.",1
"This article presents a short-term decision-making model for an electricity retailer using bilevel stochastic programing. In the proposed model, a liberalized distributed renewable energy (DRE) market in which the retailer competes with other load serving entities (LSEs) for procuring DRE is proposed. The retailer, in the upper level, decides its level of involvement in the day-ahead and real-time markets, as well as the price bids offered to DRE producers for every time period, with the goal of minimizing its expected procurement cost at a predefined risk level. On the other hand, DRE producers, in the lower level, react to the price bids offered by the retailer under study and other LSEs, to maximize their total revenues. The stochastic nature of day-ahead and real-time market prices, DRE production, electricity demand, and price bids of the retailer's rival market agents (RMAs) is taken into the formulation of the proposed model. By using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions and duality theory, the bilevel problem is transformed into its equivalent single-level mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem. Case studies are performed to show the effectiveness of the proposed model.",0
"Decarbonization of the energy sector to mitigate the consequences of climate change is possible by incorporating a greater share of electricity from renewable sources and thus reducing the share of fossil fuels in the energy mix, improving energy efficiency in general and increasing energy storage capacities. Renewable energies are increasingly permeating energy systems, causing significant shifts in the energy production mix. The success of transforming the electricity mix is dependent on the variability of renewable energy sources such as solar photovoltaic, wind, biomass, and hydro. The share of renewable sources in Romania's energy mix was determined based on real data on electricity generation and consumption in 2019. However, the current electricity consumption has significantly surpassed the electricity produced from renewable sources. Specifically, the combined contribution of hydro, solar photovoltaic, wind, and biomass energy accounted for 39.86% of the total electricity consumption. (c) 2023 The Authors.

"Confronted by increasingly tight budgets and a broad range of alternative options, policy makers need empirical methods to evaluate the effectiveness of policies aimed at supporting the diffusion of renewable energy sources (RES). Rigorous empirical studies of renewable energy policy effectiveness have typically relied on panel data models to identify the most effective mechanisms. A common characteristic of some of these studies, which has important econometric implications, is that they assume that the contribution of RES to total electricity generation will be stationary around a mean. This paper reviews such assumptions and rigorously tests the time series properties of the contribution of RES in the energy mix for the presence of a unit root. To that end, we use both individual and panel unit root tests to determine whether the series exhibit non-stationary behavior at the country level as well as for the panel as a whole. The analysis, applied to a panel of 19 OECD countries over the period 19902012, provides strong evidence that the time series of the renewable share of electricity output are not stationary in 17 of the 19 countries examined. This finding has important implications for energy policy assessment and energy policy making, which are discussed in the paper. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
"The effects of hydropower plants (HPPs) and climate/land use change pose a threat to the natural river regime. Although some approaches distinguish the climate action from anthropogenic influence on hydrological regimes in large basins, few methods propose to separate the climate effects from the regulation consequences of unique/few dams. This paper presents a new method to quantify effects of HPP and climate change/land use under the main altered river regime components, which is based on flow duration curves. The method was applied in the Grande River (Brazil), which is regulated by a large reservoir (with surface area > 70 km(2)). The indicators of hydrological alterations and the range of variability approach indicated that all drivers' effects promoted a moderate alteration in five regime components. The Itutinga-Camargos HPP implications were the major driver, with a contribution higher than 90% in every component, and it was responsible for a 0.28 x 10(9) m(3) year(-1) reduction in water superficial availability downstream. The flow regimes in headwater watersheds can be highly sensitive to dam operations, but other factors may aggravate their effects on river dynamics. The quantification of anthropogenic actions has possible applicability in other systems worldwide to assess the ecosystem services of flow regimes.",0
"In the spring of 2020, countries introduced lockdowns as radical measures to deal with the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to strong disruptions of people's everyday lives. Such drastic collective measures had previously seemed inconceivable in relation to other urgent crises, such as the climate crisis. In this paper, we ask how individual, participatory, and collective efficacy beliefs in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic transferred to efficacy beliefs regarding the climate crisis. We present comparative results from two surveys: Study 1 assesses efficacy beliefs among German-speaking Swiss residents (n = 1,016), shortly after lockdown measures were relaxed. Study 2 compares changes in efficacy beliefs among Austrian high school students (n = 113) before and after the lockdown. In Study 1, climate-related self- and participatory efficacy are enhanced by the corresponding COVID-19-related beliefs. Climate-related efficacy beliefs mediate the effect of COVID-related counterparts on climate-friendly behavior and policy support. Study 2 shows that COVID-19-related efficacy beliefs are transferred to climate-related counterparts over time, and that the transfer of participatory efficacy is moderated by perceived similarity of the two crises. Experiencing successful individual and collective action during the COVID-19 pandemic seems to inspire confidence in dealing with climate change. Underlying processes (direct transfer, consistency, awareness-raising, learning) are discussed.",0
"Decision-making has become one of the most important aspects of various problems. Accordingly, making the right decision accurately and efficiently based on the most influential criteria is still one of the critical challenges in this area. Among various optimisation issues, sustainable development of renewable energies is one the most crucial in which one of the significant prerequisites is considering the most suitable location for establishing renewable power plants. Based on these motivations, this paper developed a combinatorial multi-criteria decision model using Fuzzy-DEMATEL (FDEMATEL), Fuzzy-ANP (FANP) and Z-number-DEA (ZDEA) methods considering uncertainty and data reliability. For validation of the proposed model, a decision problem is considered for the location selection of a landfill with the aims of managing urban waste, reducing the total cost, improving the efficiency of waste disposal and community social issues. This model considers four indicators, including environmental, economic, social and strategic aspects. In addition, the Crisp-DEA (DEA) and Fuzzy-DEA (FDEA) methods are employed to validate the results using the Non-Parametric Spearman Correlation Test and a sensitivity analysis is performed for the ZDEA model. In the next step, a managerial analysis is presented. Finally, a comparison is discussed between the proposed model and existing decision models.",0

"As the holding city of the 2nd Youth Olympic Games (YOG), Nanjing is highly industrialized and urbanized, and faces several air pollution issues. In order to ensure better air quality during the event, the local government took great efforts to control the emissions from pollutant sources. However, air quality can still be affected by synoptic weather, not only emission. In this paper, the influences of meteorological factors and emission reductions were investigated using observational data and numerical simulations with WRF-CMAQ (Weather Research and Forecasting - Community Multiscale Air Quality). During the month in which the YOG were held (August 2014), the observed hourly mean concentrations of SO2, NO2, PM10, PM2.5, CO and O-3 were 11.6 mu g m(-3), 34.0 mu g m(-3), 57.8 mu g m(-3), 39.4 mu gm(-)3, 0.9 mg m(-3) and 38.8 mu g m(-3), respectively, which were below China National Ambient Air Quality Standard (level 2). However, model simulation showed that the weather conditions, such as weaker winds during the YOG, were adverse for better air quality and could increase SO2, NO2, PM10, PM2.5 and CO by 17.5, 16.9, 18.5, 18.8, 7.8 and 0.8 %. Taking account of local emission abatement only, the simulated SO2, NO2, PM10, PM2.5 and CO decreased by 24.6, 12.1, 15.1, 8.1 and 7.2 %. Consequently, stringent emission control measures can reduce the concentrations of air pollutants in the short term, and emission reduction is very important for air quality improvement during the YOG. A good example has been set for air quality protection for important social events.",0
"Using an unbalanced panel of Chinese listed renewable energy firms, this study explores how country risks and government subsidies affect the performance of renewable energy firms with different performance levels and the moderating effect of government subsidies on the risk-performance nexus throughout the performance distribution. The results reveal that different types of country risks have different effects on the performance of renewable energy firms across the distribution. Government subsidies have a positive (negative) effect on the performance of lower-performing (higher-performing) renewable energy firms. Moreover, the moderating effects of government subsidies on the relationship between country risks and renewable energy firm performance change with performance levels and ownership attributes. Therefore, the Chinese government should fully consider the varying effects of country risks and government subsidies on the performance of renewable energy firms and formulate specific policies for high-and low-performing firms.",1
"As policy makers consider strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, they need to understand the available options and the conditions under which these options become economically attractive. This paper explores the economics of carbon capture and sequestration technologies as applied to electric generating plants. The MIT Emissions Prediction and Policy Analysis (EPPA) model, a computable general equilibrium model of the world economy, is used to model carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technologies based on a natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) plant and an integrated coal gasification combined cycle (IGCC) plant. These technologies have been fully specified within the EPPA model for all regions of the world by production functions. We simulate the adoption of these technologies under scenarios with and without carbon taxes. The results illustrate how changing input prices and general equilibrium effects influence the global adoption of carbon sequestration technologies and other technologies for electricity production. Rising carbon prices lead first to the adoption of NGCC plants without carbon capture and sequestration followed by IGCC plants with capture and sequestration as natural gas prices rise.",1
"Understanding the consumption-based accounting (CBA), production-based accounting (PBA), and emissions embodied in trade is an important prerequisite for designing climate mitigation policies. Environmentally extended input-output (EEIO) models have been developed to evaluate the linkages between economic activities and environmental impacts as well as the embodied emissions in goods and services that are traded between countries. In this study, an environmentally extended global multi-regional input-output (EE GMRIO) analysis is performed to calculate Turkey's CBA emissions and import-based embodied emissions for the year 2015 using the Eora26 database, which is a simplified version of the Eora database adapted to 26 economic sectors. The key sectors and sectoral carbon intensities of countries are determined in terms of embodied emissions in imports for household consumption. Our results indicate that Turkey was a net importer of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in 2015 and about 10% of total emissions of the final consumption in Turkey have occurred in other countries. The dominant contributing sectors to a nation's GHG emissions can be quite different for the CBA and PBA approaches and the efforts to reduce GHG emissions requires a holistic approach. Import-based household emissions are assessed in terms of countries, sector and GHG intensities. Our results indicate that Turkey was a net importer of GHG emissions in 2015 with its approximately 10% of the total and 7.7% of household final consumption emissions having occurred in other countries. This also suggests that imported goods and services for household consumption have been produced in those countries with relatively low emission intensities. Considering Turkey's emissions reduction targets, these results provide methodological benefits that will enhance national efforts by giving invaluable inputs about the emission intensity of imported and exported goods and better guidance to policy makers about future strategies for low-carbon manufacturing and shifting consumption patterns.",1
"Pastures and rangelands are a dominant portion of global agricultural land and have the potential to sequester carbon (C) in soils, mitigating climate change. Management intensive grazing (MIG), or high density grazing with rotations through paddocks with long rest periods, has been highlighted as a method of enhancing soil C in pastures by increas-ing forage production. However, few studies have examined the soil C storage potential of pastures under MIG in the northeastern United States, where the dairy industry comprises a large portion of agricultural use and the regional ag-ricultural economy. Here we present a 12-year study conducted in this region using a combination of field data and the denitrification and decomposition (DNDCv9.5) model to analyze changes in soil C and nitrogen (N) over time, and the climate impacts as they relate to soil carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes. Field measurements showed: (1) increases in soil C in grazed fields under MIG (P = 0.03) with no significant increase in hayed fields (P = 0.55); and (2) that the change in soil C was negatively correlated to initial soil C content (P = 0.006). Modeled simulations also showed fields that started with relatively less soil Chad significant gains in C over the course of the study, with no significant change in fields with higher initial levels of soil C. Sensitivity analyses showed the physio-chemical status of soils (i.e., soil C and clay content) had greater influence over C storage than the intensity of grazing. More extensive grazing methods showed very little change in soil C storage or CO2 and N2O fluxes with modeled continuous grazing trending towards declines in soil C. Our study highlights the importance of considering both initial system conditions as well as management when analyzing the potential for long-term soil C storage.",1
"This paper contributes to the development of improved guidelines for cost evaluation of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) from industrial applications building on previous work in the field. It discusses key challenges and factors that have a large impact on the results of cost evaluations, but are often overlooked or insufficiently addressed. These include cost metrics (especially in the context of industrial plants with multiple output products), energy supply aspects, retrofitting costs, CO2 transport and storage, maturity of the capture technology. Where possible examples are given to demonstrate their quantitative impact and show how costs may vary widely on a case-by-case basis. Recommendations are given to consider different possible heat and power supply strategies, as well as future energy and carbon price scenarios, to better understand cost performances under various framework conditions. Since retrofitting CCS is very relevant for industrial facilities, further considerations are made on how to better account for the key elements that constitute retrofitting costs. Furthermore, instead of using a fixed unit cost for CO2 transport and storage, cost estimates should at least consider the flowrate, transport mode, transport distance and type of storage, to make more realistic cost estimates. Recommendations are also given on factors to consider when assessing the technological maturity level of CCS in various industrial applications, which is important when assessing cost contingencies and cost uncertainties. Lastly, we urge techno-economic analysis practitioners to clearly report all major assumptions and methods, as well as ideally examine the impact of these on their estimates.",1
"One of the major goals that Poland is aiming at nowadays is ensuring the country's energy security together with limiting harmful gas and dust emissions into the atmosphere. Therefore, the government puts a lot of pressure onto low emission economy development. This means, among other things, the necessity of consistent increase in the renewable sources energy production. Poland has a high potential with this respect, however, there are difficulties in creating the economy's output potential. The following paper is aimed to analyze synthetically the transmission grid infrastructure which is one of the most significant obstacles in the development of the country's renewable energy sources.",1
"Recent renewable energy development in Malaysia is described.

"Water is an essential requirement for agricultural productivity. In the agriculture sector, electricity generated by conventional sources contributes to a substantial amount of carbon footprints for pumping water through tube wells. Over the past few decades, a transitional shift towards renewable resources has increased leading to decarbonizing the environment and is considered as a viable solution for electricity production. To assist and provide a road map for this paradigm shift, the proposed study presents a techno-economic and environmental analysis of irrigation systems by carrying comparative analysis of both standalone and grid-connected systems based on four independent sites in a developing country. PV system integrated with grid enabling both energy purchase and sale (PV + G(P+S)), proved to be the most optimal configuration with cost of energy (COE) of $0.056/kWh, $0.059/kWh, $0.061/kWh, and $0.068/kWh while having net present cost (NPC) of $7,908, $20,186, $25,826, and $34,487 for Peshawar, Khyber Agency, Mardan, and Charsadda respectively, over a useful life span of 25 years. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis has been carried out based on uncertain variables such as Grid power purchase (GPP) and average solar radiation (GHI) to check the optimality behavior of the system. Results from environmental analysis revealed that (PV+ G(P+S)) system has a relatively low carbon impact as compared with conventional sources. This configuration also has the ability to prevent excess water extraction by selling any excessive solar PV energy to the grid. This study provides a policy framework insight for the entities for future optimization.",1
"Expert groups recommend that populations adopt dietary patterns higher in whole, plant-based foods and lower in red and processed meat as a high-impact climate action. Yet, there is limited understanding of populations' willingness to adopt plant-rich dietary patterns. This study examined United States (US) adults' perceptions, beliefs, and behaviors towards plant-rich dietary patterns and practices over a decade. Fifteen questions from the International Food Information Council's Food and Health Surveys (2012-2022) were analyzed across four sustainability domains (i.e., human health, environmental, social, and economic domains). Most respondents had favorable perceptions of environmentally sustainable food and beverages, but sustainability influenced less than half of consumers' purchase decisions. Plant-rich dietary pattern adherence increased across survey years (12.1% [2019] to 25.8% [2022], p < 0.001). One-quarter (28.1%) of Americans reported reducing their red meat intake over 12 months (2020-2022). Yet, another 15.5% reported greater red meat intake, and 18.8% reported greater plant-based meat alternative (PBMA) intake over 12 months. The percentage of respondents who reported greater red meat and PBMA consumption in the previous 12 months significantly increased across the years surveyed (2020-2022, p < 0.05). IFIC Survey findings highlight growing US consumer awareness of health, environmental, and social sustainability but low adoption of plant-rich dietary patterns and practices. Government leadership and coordinated actions by health professionals, civil society, and businesses are needed to educate and incentivize Americans to adopt plant-rich dietary behaviors, and greater industry transparency is needed to show how food and beverage products support human and planetary health.",1
"Collective efforts of the world community are required to mitigate global climate change. Understanding oneself as part of this world community might be crucial for individual behavior change reducing carbon emissions. We examined whether a global identity (i.e., the identification with all humans and a concern for their well-being) is related to self-reported climate-protective behavior in two studies. In a German quota sample (N = 498), global identity was positively related to the personal and societal relevance people attributed to the issue of climate change and self-reported climate-protective behavior directly and indirectly through personal and societal relevance attribution. In a U.K. quota sample (N = 400), global identity was positively related to the relevance people attributed to a received news text on climate change. Moreover, global identity was positively related to three observed indicators of climate-protective behavioral intentions after reading the news text, either directly or indirectly through relevance attribution. These results affirm the importance of a social identity perspective on climate protection. We suggest that the causal effects of global identity and ways to promote its cultivation should be investigated in more depth in future research.",1
"In the fall of 2019, Trondelag County Council, Norway, organized a Climate Workshop for children and youth. The intention of the workshop was to include children's and youth's perspectives as a foundation for a policy document titled How we do it in Trondelag. Strategy for transformations to mitigate climate change. The workshop involved a range of creative and discussion tools for input on sustainable development and climate politics. In this article, we aim to (1) describe and discuss innovative practices that include children and youth in policymaking related to climate action, and (2) discuss the theoretical implications of such policymaking in relation to children's rights, young citizenship, and intergenerational justice. We employ a generational framework and perceive climate politics as inherently ingrained in intergenerational justice, where no generation has a superior claim to the earth's resources, yet power is unfairly concentrated and accumulated among adult generations. We draw on contributions by various stakeholders involved: Two young workshop participants, two county council policymakers, and an interdisciplinary team of researchers from Childhood Studies and Design.",1
"This study studies a two-input boost DC/DC converter with high-output voltage gain. The presented converter has several advantages such as high step-up capability, continuous input current, bidirectional power flow from one of the ports, and its simple and low-cost structure. The presented converter can achieve a high-output voltage gain without using a coupled inductor or a transformer in its structure. Coupled inductors can cause voltage spikes on the main power switch, so active/passive clamp circuits are additionally required to eliminate the voltage spikes. The continuous input current of the presented converter makes it suitable for renewable energy sources such as photovoltaic panels and fuel cells.",1
"Carbon pricing initiatives have been developed globally in recent decades. Among carbon pricing initiatives, direct carbon pricing, particularly the emissions trading system (ETS), has attracted the interest of stakeholders and nations. With its ambitious potential for climate change mitigation, Vietnam has considered establishing a domestic ETS. However, studies on the effectiveness and impact of Vietnam's ETS are scarce. This study reviews the quantitative approaches to assessing Vietnam's ETS and evaluates the methodologies, limitations, and challenges of current quantitative assessments such as the simple reduced-form emission projection method, computable general equilibrium (CGE), input-output analysis (IOA), and multi-criteria analysis. CGE and IOA are highly recommended to obtain comprehensive results. However, IOA is more capable of avoiding numerous assumptions, complicating the use of CGE. This study recommends directions for possible innovative improvements for utilizing IOA in future research on Vietnam's ETS; thus, suggesting a competent approach for effectively analyzing ETS.",1
International political negotiations and national policy for climate change mitigation are increasingly focussed on the mobilisation and scale up of investments in clean energy infrastructure. This paper aims to develop the understanding of how institutional investors in the private sector perceive barriers to scaling up investment into clean energy infrastructure and what policy solutions to those barriers they advocate. This paper adds to existing scientific knowledge through a clear focus on private sector perceptions. Through the analysis of previous public statements from organisations and coalitions in the finance sector a number of investment barriers were identified. These initial barriers fed into a Delphi process. The outputs of the Delphi process were categorized into five sets of barriers and a number of policy solutions associated with investing into clean energy solutions. We conclude that there is a need for better engagement with the institutional investment community to ensure further effort on policy development that underpins investments at scale is effective and efficient.

The system has been performed for rural and remote areas using MATLAB program.",1
"Carbon taxes are an economically effective and efficient policy measure to address climate change mitigation. However, they can have severe adverse distributional effects. Recycling parts of the fiscal revenues to vulnerable, lower income households through cash transfers (social assistance) is an option to also overcome associated political difficulties. This paper simulates the distributional impacts of such a combined policy reform in Peru. In a first step, we assess the distributional impacts of varying carbon tax rates. In a second step, we evaluate different scenarios of recycling revenues through existing or expanded transfer schemes towards vulnerable households. The results indicate that a national carbon tax, without compensation, would increase poverty but have no significant impact on inequality. When tax revenues are recycled through transfer schemes, however, poverty would actually decrease. Depending on the amount to be redistributed and the design of the cash transfer scheme, our simulations show a proportional reduction in the poverty headcount of up to around 17%. In addition, the paper underlines how crucial it is to go beyond aggregate measures of poverty to better identify losers from such reform; and assure that the leave no one behind principle of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is addressed.",1
"Many countries have assigned an indispensable role for carbon capture and storage (CCS) in their national climate change mitigation pathways. However, CCS deployment has stalled in most countries with only limited commercial projects realised mainly in hydrocarbon-rich countries for enhanced oil recovery. If the Paris Agreement is to be met, then this progress must be replicated widely, including hydrocarbon-limited countries. In this study, we present a novel source-to-sink assessment methodology based on a hubs and clusters approach to identify favourable regions for CCS deployment and attract renewed public and political interest in viable deployment pathways. Here, we apply this methodology to Spain, where fifteen emission hubs from both the power and the hard-to-abate industrial sectors are identified as potential CO2 sources. A priority storage structure and two reserves for each hub are selected based on screening and ranking processes using a multi-criteria decision-making method. The priority source-to-sink clusters are identified indicating four potential development regions, with the North-Western and North-Eastern Spain recognised as priority regions due to resilience provided by different types of CO2 sources and geological structures. Up to 68.7 Mt CO2 per year, comprising around 21% of Spanish emissions can be connected to clusters linked to feasible storage. CCS, especially in the hard-to-abate sector, and in combination with other low-carbon energies (e.g., blue hydrogen and bioenergy), remains a significant and unavoidable contributor to the Paris Agreement's mid-century net-zero target. This study shows that the hubs and clusters approach can facilitate CCS deployment in Spain and other hydrocarbon limited countries.",1
"The Government of Indonesia (GoI) has a strong commitment to the target of decreasing energy intensity and reducing Greenhouse gas emissions. One of the significant solutions to reach the target is increasing energy efficiency in the lighting system in the residential sector. The objective of this paper is twofold, to estimate the potency of energy saving and emission reduction from lighting in the residential sector. Literature related to the lighting system in Indonesia has been reviewed to provide sufficient data for the estimation of the energy saving and emission reduction. The results show that the in the year 2016, a total of 95.33 TWh of nationally produced electricity is used in the residential sector. This is equal to 44% of total produced electricity. The number of costumers is 64.78 million houses. The average number of lamps and average wattage of lamps used in Indonesia are 8.35 points and 13.8 W, respectively. The number of lighting and percentage of electricity used for lighting in the residential sector in Indonesia are 20.03 TWh (21.02 %) and 497 million lamps, respectively. The projection shows that in the year 2026 the total energy for lighting and number of lamps in the residential sector are 25.05 TWh and 619 million, respectively. By promoting the present technology of high efficient lamps (LED), the potency of energy saving and emission reduction in 2026 are 2.6 TWh and 2.1 million tons CO2eq, respectively.",1
"The penetration rate of intermittent renewable energy in power system is gradually increasing, which brings challenges to the optimal dispatch of power system. To solve these problems, a multi-regional interconnected transmission network optimization method based on analytical target cascading is proposed. Firstly, the reactive power regulation characteristics of renewable energy is investigated, and the models of wind turbine and photovoltaic generation are established. Secondly, the power system is decomposed into multiple sub-systems using bus tearing method, and an optimal transmission switching (OTS) model with renewable energies is established. Then, the analytical target cascading (ATC) approach is employed to decompose the model into the main problem and several sub-problems for parallel computation to achieve coordinated optimization of the complex transmission network. Finally, the IEEE 14-bus system and the IEEE 118-bus system are used to verify the proposed model. The results show that the proposed method can deal with the coupling nonlinear problem well and promote the consumption of renewable energy.",1
"Snowmaking has been an integral part of the multi-billion-dollar ski industry in most regional markets for more than 20 years and is one of the most visible and widespread forms of climate adaptation in the tourism sector. Under accelerating climate change, snowmaking is projected to increase at most destinations - some substantially. Snowmaking has come under increasing criticism in recent years and branded by some scholars and ski industry observers as unsustainable and maladaptive as a climate change response. Using data on snowmaking from across the diverse US ski market, this study assesses snowmaking against multiple established criteria that define maladaptation. The analysis demonstrates that snowmaking is highly place-context specific, varying at the individual operator and regional market scales, and represents a continuum from successful (and sustainable) adaptation to maladaptation. Regions of the US where snowmaking is most likely to be maladaptive are identified (water insecure and carbon intense electricity grids). The framework highlights the importance of scale and a tourism system perspective when assessing (mal)adaptation and provides decision-makers with a tool to evaluate the compatibility of snowmaking with climate action plans at the destination and regional scale.",0
"Zhejiang Province is a developed province in China. Over the years, the scale of economic development has been expanding. At the same time, Zhejiang province attaches great importance to reducing carbon emissions and has achieved remarkable results. Based on the grey correlation theory, this paper analyses the influencing factors of carbon emission in Zhejiang Province, and puts forward a series of suggestions for realizing carbon emission reduction in Zhejiang Province. The results show that the factors affecting carbon emissions in Zhejiang Province, in order of importance from high to low, are as follows:total population; total GDP; financial investment in education; financial investment in environmental protection and financial investment in science and technology. Therefore, in order to achieve the goal of carbon emission reduction in Zhejiang Province, we should focus on the following aspects: controlling the population and advocating green consumption; Improving the green growth level of local economy; increasing education expenditure to improve the people's awareness of energy saving and environmental protection; increasing financial science and technology expenditure to develop advanced carbon emission reduction technology; Further increasing investment in environmental protection to purchase and configure more advanced environmental protection equipment.

"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted relay mobile edge computing (MEC) network is a prominent concept, where network deployment is flexible and network coverage is wide. In scenarios such as emergency communications and low-cost coverage, optimization of offloading methods and resource utilization are important ways to improve system effectiveness due to limited terminal and UAV energy and hardware equipment. A multilevel edge computing network resource optimization model on the basis of UAV fusion that provides relay forwarding and offload services is established by considering the initial energy state of the UAV, the green energy charging function, and the reliability of computing offload. With normalized system utility function maximization as the goal, a Markov decision process algorithm meets the needs of the practical application scene and provides a flexible and effective unloading mode. This algorithm is adopted to solve the optimal offloading mode and the optimal resource utilization scheme. Simulations verify the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed multilevel offloading model. The proposed model can optimize system resource allocation and effectively improve the utility function and user experience of computing offloading systems.",0
"Deforestation in mid-to high latitudes is hypothesized to have the potential to cool the Earth's surface by altering biophysical processes(1-3). In climate models of continental-scale land clearing, the cooling is triggered by increases in surface albedo and is reinforced by a land albedo-sea ice feedback(4,5). This feedback is crucial in the model predictions; without it other biophysical processes may overwhelm the albedo effect to generate warming instead(5). Ongoing land-use activities, such as land management for climate mitigation, are occurring at local scales (hectares) presumably too small to generate the feedback, and it is not known whether the intrinsic biophysical mechanism on its own can change the surface temperature in a consistent manner(6,7). Nor has the effect of deforestation on climate been demonstrated over large areas from direct observations. Here we show that surface air temperature is lower in open land than in nearby forested land. The effect is 0.85 +/- 0.44 K (mean +/- one standard deviation) northwards of 45 degrees N and 0.21 +/- 0.53 K southwards. Below 35 degrees N there is weak evidence that deforestation leads to warming. Results are based on comparisons of temperature at forested eddy covariance towers in the USA and Canada and, as a proxy for small areas of cleared land, nearby surface weather stations. Night-time temperature changes unrelated to changes in surface albedo are an important contributor to the overall cooling effect. The observed latitudinal dependence is consistent with theoretical expectation of changes in energy loss from convection and radiation across latitudes in both the daytime and night-time phase of the diurnal cycle, the latter of which remains uncertain in climate models(8).",0
"A level-crossing control system is specified in CCS, motivated by a temporal logic specification of the safety requirements. We show that, with certain reservations, these can be satisfactorily stated entirely within CCS. The crossing system is divided into two smaller subsystems, which are shown to be equivalent to the original single system, and whose behaviour is then analysed using the methods of the calculus. We also show that the crossing satisfies the safety requirements; there is no bisimulation although the system is both 'may' and 'must' equivalent to the specification. Some of the implications of this are discussed.",0
"This article makes two contributions to the COVID-related green recovery literature, which is dominated by optimistic and speculative opportunity narratives. Mobilising insights from political science theories, our conceptual contribution is to suggest that green recovery analyses should focus not only on the opportunities permissive conditions') created by the COVID-crisis, but also on the actions and strategic considerations productive conditions') and pre-existing contexts ('critical antecedents') that shape the exploitation of these opportunities. Our empirical contribution is to analyse actual green recovery spending plans of three leading countries (France, Germany, and the UK), focusing on the size, sectoral allocation, and implementation choices, which differ markedly. France spends the most, both in absolute and GDP-relative terms, followed by Germany. UK spending is 43% less than France. The UK and France mostly support existing sectors (buildings, railways), while Germany focuses 57.8% of its funding on new technologies (electric vehicles, hydrogen). We explain country differences by analysing different mixes of strategic considerations, including climate mitigation, jobs, GDP growth, productivity, exports, global competitiveness, regional support, social fairness, party politics, and electoral ambitions. We relate these different motivations to pre-existing context conditions such as varying socio-economic effects of the COVID-crisis, pre-existing concerns (e.g., high unemployment, social and regional inequalities), the economic importance of particular sectors, and pre-existing climate policy plans. We conclude that the green recovery plans are powerfully shaped by pre-existing contexts, plans and developments, which constrain the use of the crisis-induced opportunities.",1
"Public health and climate change mitigation are strongly related to the efficiency of a unified vehicle-health system. To date, however, the existing DEA studies have not incorporated a robust set of transportation and public health indicators to evaluate the performance of the vehicle-health system. Our approach maps the relationship between transportation and health indicators in a network DEA framework. In addition, this study develops a new methodological framework for identifying stage priorities for decision-makers, peer evaluation and an understanding of the effects of policy in a comprehensive vehicle-health production system. This study empirically evaluates indicators of vehicle use and their effects on public health for each US state. The main conclusions are summarized: First, the network DEA and cross-efficiency network DEA models have significant methodological differences, highlighting the importance of model selection for empirical analysis. Second, US states exhibit enormous disparities in their prior strategies. The relative weights of the vehicle use stage and health outcomes stage confirm differing levels of importance attached to either stage. Third, group heterogeneity and technology inequality are observed among US states. Both intra-group and inter-group inequalities drive technology inequality. Moreover, considerable heterogeneity exists in the intra-group decomposition of the overall efficiency Theil index among the three network DEA models. Finally, promoting a safe and integrated transportation network improves vehicle-health performance, implying that strategic transportation policies hold significant potential for improving public health.",0
"Integrating large scale variable renewable energy sources (VRESs) such as solar photovoltaic generation plants and wind farms, with electric power systems achieve many targets, i.e. economic, environmental, and technical. VRES also presents new generation technologies to the traditional grid. These technologies behavior should be studied in depth during grid normal and abnormal conditions. Solar Photovoltaic Generation (SPVG) is a common solar energy applications. Whereas, wind farms of a variable speed wind turbine with a Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) have a great potential among different wind turbine technologies. This paper presents a comparative study between traditional synchronous, SPVG and DFIG responses during substantial power deficiency cases. This study summarizes the main features of each technology frequency behavior. The study also suggests several recommendations for stabilizing the grid frequency with large scale VRES.",1
"As a result of the growing global demand for energy, together with the depletion of resources and the growing emphasis on mitigating climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, an urgent need for an evolution of the renewable energy resources has emerged. On the architectural scene, we have become accustomed to seeing buildings incorporated with photovoltaics and wind turbines. Despite the great contribution of biomass as a clean energy producer, the integration of biomass into architecture is quite modest and still in its initial phases. Microalgae, as a plant-based biomass, can outperform other renewable resources with their potential to absorb CO2, recycle wastewater, and release O-2. The limited experience regarding building-integrated microalgae photobioreactors (PBRs) requires shedding light on some issues. So, this paper aims to explore the following: 1) the proper types of PBRs for integration with buildings, 2) the overall bioprocess and the design considerations regarding PBRs and their technical requirements, 3) the environmental and energetic performance of PBRs, 4) their challenges, and 5) their prospects. Thus, the paper's methodology consists of 1) reviewing the promulgated literature concerning microalgae and PBRs, 2) reviewing and analyzing three building-integrated PBRs and three urban-integrated PBRs, and 3) reviewing the environmental and energetic performance of building-integrated PBRs. The paper has concluded that the symbiosis between PBRs and facades encounters some challenges, including 1) the biorefinery infrastructure, 2) the provision of a source of CO2, and 3) the high initial cost. On the other hand, the multifaceted environmental prospects of building-integrated PBRs are represented in 1) energy savings; 2) GHG emissions reduction; 3) oxygen and hydrogen release; 4) biofuel production; and 5) wastewater treatment. The unique benefits of the bio-facades through the combination of the technical and biological cycles within buildings inaugurate an innovative approach to sustainability by integrating environmental, energetic, and iconic values.",1

Early precaution needed to be taken in reducing CO2 emissions from different sources is highlighted. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.",1
"The energy consumed in Ireland is primarily achieved by the combustion of fossil fuels. Ireland's only indigenous fossil fuel is peat; all other fossil fuels are imported. As fossil fuels continually become more expensive, their use as an energy source also has a negative impact on the environment. Ireland's energy consumption can be separated into three divisions: transportation, electricity generation and heat energy. Ireland however has a vast range of high quality renewable energy resources. Ireland has set a target that 33% of its electricity will be generated from renewable sources by 2020 [I. Government. Delivering a Sustainable Energy Future for Ireland; 2007.]. The use of biomass, wind and ocean energy technologies is expected to play a major part in meeting this target. The use of renewable energy technologies will assist sustainable development as well as being a solution to several energy related environmental problems. This paper presents the current state of renewable energy technologies and potential resources available in Ireland. Considering Ireland's present energy state, a future energy mix is proposed.

"Transport -energy transitions pose complex challenges that have been extensively studied in high -income countries in response to national mandates for climate action. Low- and middle -income countries, however, have low but rapidly growing motorisation rates and face very different challenges in adopting new technologies to foster economic development and ensure equitable access to clean transportation. Here, we present a set of narrative scenarios for the future of the Kenyan transport -energy system co -developed through engagement with 41 local experts and decision -makers. Through the co -development of a Kenyan transportenergy system model, we present a decision -support tool, populated with those scenarios, to assist policymakers at regional, national and international levels in building policy and investment pipelines to support low -carbon economic growth. We find that Kenya's transport -energy system can meet both development and climate goals, but this demands strong policy support for efficient public transport and targeted support for road vehicle electrification. Increased support for non -motorised transport is essential to provide equitable access to services and economic opportunities. Favourable pathways result in significant e -mobility uptake, which is anticipated to increase electricity demand by 5%-56% from 2023 to 2040, relative to the IEA Kenya Energy Outlook's Stated Policies scenario, representing a 2.7-3.9x increase in Kenya's total electricity demand over the same period. From a macro -fiscal perspective, results show that e -mobility has two important consequences for Kenya. Firstly, under high e -mobility scenarios, there is a negative fiscal impact that taxation revenues from the sale of transport fuels reduce by up to 41% relative to the low e -mobility scenario (though, notably, they still increase marginally from the 2023 level because of increasing transport demand). Secondly, high e -mobility scenarios have a positive impact on balance of payments by reducing the fuel import bill by up to 69% relative to the low e -mobility baseline. This corresponds to a reduction in foreign exchange requirement of up to $4.2bn annually by 2050.",1
"Environmental effects are one of the main concerns of massive desalination facilities. To reach the objective of no brine discharge the salt from seawater must be completely separated and obtained as a secondary and valuable product. If no CO 2 emission increase is desired, the power source must be a combination of renewable energy systems (RES). This paper presents an analysis of an integrated desalination scheme consisting of two sequential systems: a multi-effect distillation (MED) plant and a mechanical vapour compression (MVC) system based on evaporator equipment. The energy is obtained by several wind turbines (WT) and a thermal solar collector (TSC) field. Separation of salt and water is achieved in a coupled multi-effect distillation-mechanical vapour compression (MED + MVC) two step process. The MED stage is driven by thermal solar collectors, whereas the energy consuming mechanical compression of the vapour (MVC) is fuelled by wind-powered turbines. Interestingly, the final products of this process are dry salt and fresh water. Such a system has been designed and dimensioned for a throughput of 100 m(3)/h of desalted water A preliminary study of the investment, amortization and exploitation costs of a combined MED + MVC + WT + TSC installation with these dimensions has been done. The price of desalted water, after considering the profits due to the sale of salt and electricity has been estimated at 0.59 (sic)/m(3). If the initial investment has a 35% subsidy, a final price of 0.41 (sic)/m(3) could be ensured, which is near the price associated to conventional energy sources. An outline of the solar collector system and the technical requirements of the wind turbines in needed to meet the energy demand of the MED + MVC system are also included.",1
"The new Agenda 2030 for sustainable development call for initiatives to bridge the gap between environmental protection and socio-economic development. To provide insight on the relationship between socio-economics, and ecology, the current study examines the effectiveness of environmental stringency and green energy to mitigate the effects of fossil energy and greenhouse gas emissions on human well-being and income for 12 emerging economies. The outcomes from dynamic heterogeneous panel estimators of cross-sectional-based auto regressive distributed lag and cross-sectional-augmented distributed lag indicate that: (i) green energy consumption and electricity consumption have a substantial positive effect on well-being and per capita income. (ii) The stringent environmental policy is found to decrease per capita income, but it increases well-being, while the square of environmental stringency is found to increase per capita income. (iii) Fossil energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions have a negative effect on well-being but a positive impact on income. The outcome of U-test confirmed the presence of a U-shaped curve with a turning point (0.433) between per capita income and environmental policy stringency. This study yielded consistent results from the panel Granger causality test. Based on our findings, we may argue that it is necessary to prioritize human well-being over economic growth, and suggest several policy implications to achieve sustainable development goals.",1
"Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan are deficient of domestic fossil energy sources and depend significantly on imported fuels. Since the oil shock in the 1970s, all three countries have promoted renewable energy as an alternative energy source to improve energy security. Currently, renewable energy is being promoted to build low-carbon economies. This study reviews the development of renewable energy policies and roadmaps. It also examines and compares strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) of these countries in the context of advancing renewable energy policies and technologies and expanding domestic renewable energy installations, as well as strategically positioning themselves in the international renewable energy market as exporters of clean energy technologies. Through the SWOT analysis, this paper identifies a capacity for additional renewable energy deployment in these countries and highlights the necessity of increased cooperation between the three countries to strengthen their domestic and regional renewable energy sectors and compete in the global renewable energy market in the post-Fukushima era.

"This paper discusses the use of a 2-D numerical model representing a typical depleted pinnacle reef reservoir to generate synthetic data for multiple CO2 injection periods after a prolonged period of oil and gas production. The data are analyzed with conventional pressure-transient analysis and injectivity-index approaches from petroleum reservoir engineering practice. Pressure falloff data from multiple shut-in periods, with and without boundary effects, indicate that the system response is similar to that of a composite reservoir with different total mobility and total compressibility values in the inner (CO2-rich) and outer (CO2-free) regions. The total mobility of the inner zone can be approximated by the total mobility of the gas phase in the vicinity of the CO2-oil front, while the total mobility of the outer zone corresponds to the total mobility of the oil phase in the undisturbed region. The injectivity index, calculated as injection rate divided by the pressure buildup from reference conditions, yields a quasi-stable value during the transient period which can be correlated to the permeability-thickness product of the injection zone. During the boundary-dominated (pseudo-steady-state) period, a flowing material balance plot can be utilized to determine an apparent injectivity index, which is higher than the true injectivity index because of multi-phase skin effects.

"In this study, the authors projected the impacts of clean energy investment on environmental degradation by applying a novel and dynamic Autoregressive Distributed Lag (DARDL) model for Pakistan from 1990 to 2022. Most researchers have used ecological footprint or CO2 emissions indicators to look at how clean energy investment affects environmental degradation, which primarily represents contamination induced by humans' consumption patterns and does not consider the impact of the supply side. Against this background, the study scrutinized the dynamic interaction between clean energy investment and environmental sustainability using the load capacity factor (LCF) as an ecological indicator in Pakistan, including economic growth, population density, trade openness, urbanization, and industrialization in the analysis. The long-run estimates from DARDL indicate that a 1 percent upsurge in clean energy investment mitigates environmental degradation by approximately 0.42 percent on average, controlling for other factors. Further, the study also revealed that a 1 percent increase in clean energy investment diminishes dirty energy consumption by approximately 0.45 percent. The validity of the findings is confirmed using alternate methods, i.e., KRLS. The study recommends that Pakistan prioritize investment in clean energy projects to promote environmental sustainability and enforce environmental regulations to reduce the adverse externalities associated with dirty energy activities.",1
"Quantitative systems modelling in support of climate policy has tended to focus more on the supply side in assessing interactions among technology, economy, environment, policy and society. By contrast, the demand side is usually underrepresented, often emphasising technological options for energy efficiency improvements. In this perspective, we argue that scientific support to climate action is not only about exploring capacity of what, in terms of policy and outcome, but also about assessing feasibility and desirability, in terms of when, where and especially for whom. Without the necessary behavioural and societal transformations, the world faces an inadequate response to the climate crisis challenge. This could result from poor uptake of low-carbon technologies, continued high-carbon intensive lifestyles, or economy-wide rebound effects. For this reason, we propose a framing for a holistic and transdisciplinary perspective on the role of human choices and behaviours in influencing the low-carbon transition, starting from the desires of individuals and communities, and analysing how these interact with the energy and economic landscape, leading to systemic change at the macro-level. In making a case for a political ecology agenda, we expand our scope, from comprehending the role of societal acceptance and uptake of end-use technologies, to co-developing knowledge with citizens from non-mainstream and marginalised communities, and to defining the modelling requirements to assess the decarbonisation potential of shifting lifestyle patterns in climate change and action.",1
"Variations in the uptake of atmospheric carbon by vegetation over India, the second-highest contributor to global greening, have enormous implications for climate change mitigation. Global studies conclude that temperature and total water storage (TWS) cause interannual variations of carbon uptake based on the correlation coefficient, which is not a causality measure. Here, we apply a statistically rigorous causality approach, Peter Clark momentary conditional independence, to the monthly observed satellite and station-based gridded dataset of India's climate and carbon uptake variables. We find no existence of causal connections from TWS to gross primary production (GPP) or net photosynthesis (PSN). Causal relationships exist from precipitation to GPP and PSN. Since shallow-rooted croplands dominate India's green cover, impacts of precipitation on carbon capture of the the land ecosystem are immediate and not via TWS. Our results identify the key climate drivers of GPP/PSN variability and highlight interactions between water and the carbon cycle in India. Our results also highlight the need for formal causal analysis using climate and earth sciences observations rather than the conventional practices of inferring causality from correlations.",1
"AimColombia has committed to ambitious forest restoration targets which include a 1 million ha Bonn Challenge commitment and 6.47-8.31 million ha (rehabilitation and restoration, respectively) under the National Restoration Plan. Determining where and how to implement programs to achieve these targets remains a significant challenge.LocationColombia.MethodsWe adopt a multi-objective optimisation framework for restoration planning and apply it to Colombia. We explore cost-effective solutions that leverage the potential for assisted natural regeneration benefits while accounting for opportunity and establishment costs of restoration and maximising biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation benefits. We explore four politically relevant restoration area-based targets (1, 6, 6.47 and 8.31 million ha) and identify minimum cost, and suites of maximum benefit and cost-effective solutions.ResultsWe identify solutions that simultaneously perform well across biodiversity and carbon objectives, despite trade-offs between these objectives. We find that cost-effective solutions can achieve on average 91.1%, 90.8%, 90.5% and 90.1% of maximum carbon benefit and 100% of the maximum biodiversity benefit while significantly reducing costs. On average, the cost-effective solutions reduce the cost by 87.5%, 56.8%, 59.6% and 46.2% compared to the maximum benefit solutions considering one, six, 6.47 and 8.31 million ha restoration targets, respectively.Main ConclusionsColombia has committed to bold restoration and conservation targets, such as those under the new 2030 Convention on Biological Diversity Global Biodiversity Framework. Strategic forest restoration planning will play an important role in achieving Colombia's biodiversity conservation and climate mitigation goals. We provide quantitative evidence to inform planning for environmentally and economically sensible restoration policy and practice in the country. Our framework and results can help guide Colombia towards meeting its ambitious forest restoration targets cost-effectively.",1
"The general context of this proposal is represented by the energy-efficient smart home that integrates renewable energy sources such as photovoltaic panels. The objective of this article is to minimize the amount of energy consumed from the national energy grid by producer-consumers of energy from renewable sources, in their own smart homes. In order to fulfill this goal, it was necessary to estimate the amount of renewable energy produced on the day-ahead horizon and to schedule the operation of controllable consumers in a smart home. To predict the amount of energy produced, two approaches were used: the first was based on data, and used techniques specific to artificial intelligence, more specifically, multilayer perceptron and radial-basis-function neural networks, and the second was based on models. The accuracy of the short-term prediction horizon of the techniques used was evaluated with quantitative performance indicators so that the most appropriate one in relation to the goal of the article could be selected to be used in the test scenarios. The scheduling of consumer functioning was based on their classification in relation to their ability to be controlled, and on the selection from the peer-reviewed literature of an optimization algorithm which, by load shifting from a smart home, ensured the optimal fulfillment of the objective function. The selected load-shifting algorithm was then integrated into and tested on a real database. The data used were monitored for two representative days, in terms of the amount of energy from renewable energy sources produced and consumed. The load-shifting algorithm proved its effectiveness through the results obtained and which are reported in the article.",1
"The paper considers the role of anaerobic digestion in promoting good agricultural practice on farms and the contribution this would make to reducing the environmental impacts associated with manure management. There are no regulatory drivers to promote the use of digestion in Europe, and the technology has only been widely adopted where economic drivers and coherent policies have been implemented at a national level. These measures have included direct subsidy on the energy price paid for green electricity, and exemption of tax when biogas is used as a vehicle fuel. In those countries where financial incentives are not available or where a financial penalty is incurred through the regulatory regime, the uptake of digestion has been poor. Even with subsidies, digestion of animal manures as a single substrate is not common, and countries with successful schemes have achieved this either by permitting the import of wastes onto the farm or offering bonus subsidies for the use of energy crops. Both of these measures improve the energy efficiency of the process by increasing the volumetric methane production, although concerns are expressed that attention could concentrate on energy production at the expense of improving manure management.",1
"Anaerobic digestion (AD) is a technology that is gaining popularity because of the need for more renewable energy sources around the world. AD is a complex series of biochemical reactions that ultimately result in the formation of biogas, which is a mixture of methane and carbon dioxide with other trace elements. From large installations to small personal reactors, the underlying basic process is the same, but through research, pretreatments and substrate co-digestion are becoming more popular to enhance biogas production. Reactor design and substrate selection also vary depending on the installation's location. Biogas cleaning and upgrading help to increase the usability of the gas for multiple applications. The economic viability depends on the location in the world and the available substrate quality and quantity. AD processes rely heavily on government subsidies to stay profitable. In developing countries, AD profitability is not a concern, as this technology provides a way to better human life in these areas. This review presents a detailed look at the AD technology, provides a discussion on the economics of AD, and suggests future studies to enhance the technology.",1
"The atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases have increased to unprecedented levels during last decades, raising concerns about their effect on climate change. Agriculture and land use change play an important role in atmospheric CO2 emission and fixation, especially by affecting the soil carbon (C) storage. In this context, agroforestry systems (AFSs) could play an important role contributing to climate change mitigation. Given the importance of olive cultivation in the Mediterranean region, it is important to investigate soil C stock in olive groves, and to assess which agronomic practices could improve the soil C stock in these systems. For this reason, a study was conducted in different olive groves, including conventional and organic management, and a typical silvopastoral AFS. Furthermore, an abandoned olive grove and nearby forest were examined as a comparison. Soil samples were collected in each farm and analysed for C content and physico-chemical characteristics. This study indicates that, irrespective of the management, olive groves in the Umbria region of Italy are characterised by a high level of soil C stock if compared to those growing in other areas and to forest ecosystems, indicating that the practices adopted in the area are not negatively affecting soil C storage. A slightly lower soil C stock was measured in the silvopastoral AFS in comparison to the other farms, while high soil C stock was associated with the use of pomace, suggesting that this practice can be used to further increase soil C stock in olive orchards.",1
"Fast weathering of parent materials and rapid mineralization of organic matter because of prevalent climatic conditions, and subsequent development of acidity and loss/exhaustion of nutrient elements due to intensive agricultural practices have resulted in the degradation of soil fertility and productivity in the vast tropical areas of the world. There is an urgent need for rejuvenation of weathered tropical soils to improve crop productivity and sustainability. For this purpose, biochar has been found to be more effective than other organic soil amendments due to biochar's stability in soil, and thus can extend the benefits over long duration. This review synthesizes information concerning the present status of biochar application in highly weathered tropical soils highlighting promising application strategies for improving resource use efficiency in terms of economic feasibility. In this respect, biochar has been found to improve crop productivity and soil quality consistently through liming and fertilization effects in low pH and infertile soils under low-input conditions typical of weathered tropical soils. This paper identifies several advance strategies that can maximize the effectiveness of biochar application in weathered tropical soils. However, strategies for the reduction of costs of biochar production and application to increase the material's use efficiency need future development. At the same time, policy decision by linking economic benefits with social and environmental issues is necessary for successful implementation of biochar technology in weathered tropical soils. This review recommends that advanced biochar strategies hold potential for sustaining soil quality and agricultural productivity in tropical soils.",1
"Despite the significant natural potential, geothermal energy in Serbia has traditionally been used in balneology and recreation, while its share in the country's total energy balance is almost negligible (0.05%). The present paper deals with the City Municipality of Vranjska Banja as a pioneer in the territory of Serbia in using geothermal energy for heating. The concept and methodology of the present research are directly related to the utilization of geothermal resources for district heating in the Vranjska Banja area. The presented analysis includes: determining the available amount of energy, identifying the energy needs of selected public facilities, and the estimation of investment necessary for energy utilization. A survey, combined with field research, is focused on four public facilities connected to the heating system relying on geothermal sources, as well as on two facilities that should be connected to the system in the next phases. The results show economic, ecological, and technological advantages of using geothermal heating systems, as well as the acceptable price of equipment maintenance. An economic assessment of the transition of one facility from the existing heating system to a system relying on geothermal energy has also been made. The analysis confirms the cost-effectiveness of using geothermal energy and reveals numerous ecological advantages (safe heating, absence of CO2 emission) over other energy sources.",1
"The challenge of achieving net-zero carbon emissions in the shipping sector is a pressing issue that is yet to be fully overcome. While new fuels and technologies hold promise for the future, they are not currently viable solutions on a large scale in the short-term. One strategy that is being considered as a way to reduce CO2 and CO emissions in the immediate future is carbon capture technology. Additionally, the possibility of a carbon tax being implemented in the future further strengthens the case for the adoption of this technology, which is already quite mature and in use in industries, although it has yet to be developed in the maritime sector. In this paper, the authors start from the definition of carbon capture technology to provide a technical overview of the solutions that are currently available to the maritime sector. Given the absolute innovation of such systems for application on board ships, the authors studied their installation and developed appropriate schemes to illustrate the feasibility of integration of these new technologies on board. Furthermore, the authors highlight the different levels of technological readiness of the proposed systems based on their potential for implementation on board commercial vessels.",1
"Carbon (C) budget at cropping systems has not only agronomic but also environmental relevance because of their contribution to both emissions and removals of greenhouse gases (GHGs). Ideally, sustainable orchards are expected to remove atmospheric CO2 at a rate greater than that of the emissions because of (i) optimized biology of the system and (ii) reduced on-site/offsite inputs sourced by the technosphere. However, such a computation might produce inconsistent results and in turn biased communication on sustainability of the cropping systems because C accounting framework(s) are used under unclear context. This study examined the sustainability of orchards in terms of impact on GHGs focusing its significance at the field, ecosystem and global dimension analyzing some operational aspects and limitations of existing frameworks (e.g., net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB), life cycle assessment (LCA)). Global relevance of sustainable orchard was also discussed considering the C sequestration at cropland as instructed by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The uniqueness of olive tree lifespan duration and C sequestration is discussed within the Product Environmental Footprint of agrifood product. The paper also highlighted overlapping components among the NECB, LCA and IPCC frameworks and the need for an integrated C accounting scheme for a more comprehensive and detailed mapping of sustainability in agriculture.",1
"Negative emissions technologies (NETs) approaches are an essential part of virtually any scenario in which global warming is limited to 1.5 degrees C in accordance with the Paris Agreement. Discussions often focus on two technologies due to their substantial carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration potential: bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS). However, the large-scale deployment of both technologies-especially BECCS-may lead to significant human rights infringements. This paper aims to analyze the impact of both technologies on human rights from the methodological perspective of a legal interpretation of international law. It shows that a large-scale BECCS strategy, which inevitably requires enormous land-use changes, will most likely infringe upon the right to food, the right to water, and the right to a healthy environment. In contrast, large-scale DACCS approaches will likely have a smaller human rights impact, but the energy-intensive process could also infringe upon the right to energy. Balancing these human rights with other freedom rights, e.g., of consumers and enterprises, the paper will further demonstrate that from the perspective of human rights, rapid emission reductions and the minimization of livestock farming-and also less risky nature-based options such as peatland and forest management-should prevail before any large-scale industrial NET strategies.",1
"Developed societies are facing a number of problems due to technological advances, including the increased requirement for power, resulting in small electrical grids utilizing local power sources, also known as a microgrid (MG). The MG is linked to the central electrical network or runs alone in the form of a power island based on the renewable energy sources and dispatchable units. On the other hand, the smart grid concept is built based on the employment of sensors and cloud computing systems to address the problems. It is possible to decrease energy consumption problems by using a smart MG; however, proper implementation is necessary to avoid generating too much information. As a result, the study uses fog computing for energy production and consumption analysis and management by reducing the amount of information passing to the cloud. The proposed model would reduce service response times in an active strategy. To this end, an enhanced particle swarm optimization with Levy Walk is used for solving the optimization problem based on the real-time data receiving from the digital twin of the system. As a result, to evaluate the efficiency and accuracy of the fog in the case, efficiency evaluations based on active and passive strategies are carried out in order to determine whether parameters including the number of residents, the optimization algorithm, moving appliances, and the power resource affect response times and source demands.",0
"China has actively participated in global climate governance and put forward its ambitious carbon neutrality target. The formulation of scientific plans has become the primary concern of the policy makers, especially for the 14th and 15th Five-Year Plans (FYP) which are important periods to secure the neutrality pledge and transform the whole economy. Since the carbon emission intensity play a key role in achieving carbon neutrality, it is necessary to summarize and explore the evolution trend of carbon emission intensity as well as its driving factors. Therefore, an integrated decomposition framework is developed to study the carbon emission intensity in the past three FYPs from the national, regional and industrial levels. Furthermore, towards the carbon neutrality target, moderate scenario and advanced scenario are designed to predict the future evolution trend of the carbon emission intensity and driving factors in the 14th and 15th FYPs (2021-2030). The main results are as follows: (1) During the three FYPs, factor substitution is the main force contributing to the decreased carbon emission intensity, but this effect gradually decreased. This indicates that it is an inevitable trend to further promote internal optimization and reform of energy system. (2) The change of energy structure exerts a positive effect on the carbon emission intensity decline, but it is not significant, especially in the industrial sector. (3) With the rich factor endowment, central and eastern regions can reduce carbon emission intensity through factor substitution and industrial structure transformation, while the western region is not. (4) In the future, the role of industrial structure optimization and technology progress will be gradually significant. Finally, our findings provide practical guidance on achieving carbon emission intensity reduction and enlightenments on policymaking.",1
"Fugitive emissions (FE) nowadays become a great concern around the world due to their negative impacts on productivity, environment and health. This paper presents a mathematical model for reducing fugitive emissions from piping equipment. The problem is formulated as mixed integer linear programming and coded in General Algebra Modeling System (GAMS). The MILP model proposed in this work can be used to identify the most appropriate technologies for fugitive emissions reduction as well as maximize the profit.. Application of this model on the case yields a significant FE reduction up to 82.2 percent, illustrating the effectiveness of the technique.",1
"Analyzing the politics and policy implications in Brazil of attributing extreme weather events to climate change, we argue for greater place-based sensitivity in recommendations for how to frame extreme weather events relative to climate change. Identifying geographical limits of current recommendations to emphasize the climate role in such events, we explore Brazilian framings of the two tragic national disasters, as apparent in newspaper coverage of climate change. We find that a variety of contextual factors compel environmental leaders and scientists in Brazil to avoid and discourage highlighting the role of climate change in national extreme events. Against analysts' general deficit-finding assumptions, we argue that the Brazilian framing tendency reflects sound strategic, socio-environmental reasoning, and discuss circumstances in which attributing such events to climate change-and, by extension, attribution science-can be ineffective for policy action on climate change and other socio-environmental issues in need of public pressure and preventive action. The case study has implications beyond Brazil by begging greater attention to policies and politics in particular places before assuming that attribution science and discursive emphasis on the climate role in extreme events are the most strategic means of achieving climate mitigation and disaster preparedness. Factors at play in Brazil might also structure extreme events attribution politics in other countries, not least some other countries of the global South.",0
"The aim of this research is to investigate how renewable energy consumption effects pollution and whether the relationship between income and pollution formulates the inverted U-shaped relationship which signals the existence of the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC). To realize the aims of this study, non-stationary panel data techniques were utilized to examine the seven selected regions. According to Pedroni and Fisher type cointegration tests, the variables were cointegrated. Moreover, the dynamic ordinary least square (DOLS) and the vector error correction model Granger causality revealed that renewable energy consumption has a significant negative effect on pollution in Central and Eastern Europe, Western Europe, East Asia and the Pacific, South Asia, and the Americas. However, the tests revealed that renewable energy consumption has no significant effect on pollution in the Middle East and North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa. In addition, the results in general indicated that the existence of the EKC hypothesis is determined by the significance of the renewable energy consumption. Therefore, the EKC hypothesis was only found in the regions where their renewable energy has a significant correlation with pollution in both the short run and the long run. Furthermore, a number of policy recommendations were provided for the investigated regions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",1
"The present article sets out to examine the connection between energy transition and factors associated with renewable energy sources, buildings and other sectors, placing emphasis on France. The methodology includes: Collection of scholarly writings, classification, identification of research questions, bibliographic analysis, identification of important findings, discussion. The results of a study (EDF, Le nucle ' aire en chiffres) demonstrated that, in 2019, around 80% of the electricity production from nuclear energy (in France) was provided by 4 regions: Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes, Grand Est, Centre-Val de Loire, Normandie. France has a high dependence on nuclear power generation and, for this reason, renewable-energy penetration is an imperative part of the French energy transition. Numerous studies show that energy transition requires actions based on burgeoning and avant-garde technologies, and effective policies. Moreover, energy transition poses challenges: decisions on nuclear power plants, sustainable development of small-island economies, etc. A discussion on the energy transition in Corsica (France) is also provided. Regarding the French overseas territories Corse (Corsica), Guadeloupe, Martinique, Guyane, Mayotte, Re ' union, the findings of a study (Rakotoson and Praene, 2017) demonstrate that thanks to renewable energy sources/network interconnection, Corsica and French Guiana have lower emissions in comparison to the other territories: 0.505 and 0.373 kg CO2.eq/kWhe, respectively.",1
"Substantial amounts of money have been invested in peatland restoration over the last decades to address the current challenges of global changes and to enhance biodiversity. Given the magnitude of financial investments and the pressing societal needs, it is essential that appropriate decisions are made about the restoration techniques employed to avoid negative consequences and to optimise the benefits to human society. Based on the knowledge and expertise that has been developed over recent decades, three approaches to peatland restoration are discussed regarding their implications for climate change, nutrient fluxes and biodiversity: peatland inundation, topsoil removal and slow rewetting. Considered over the long term, for instance tens or hundreds of years, rewetted peatlands have the potential to fulfil multiple restoration goals, including those targeting climate change mitigation, water quality protection and species conservation. In short term, ill-informed decisions on the approach to peatland restoration can generate negative impacts, for instance on the downstream water quality or radiative forcing gas emissions. Synthesis and application. The restoration of peatlands, and the trajectory that any restorative action may take, is a matter of societal choice; however, it is essential that society understands the broad potential benefits and disadvantages that such restoration may have so that evidence-based choices can be made.",1
"The combustion of effluent biogas from a palm oil mill is not feasible on a large scale because of its low calorific value (LCV). Therefore, the captured biogas is usually flared because of a lack of appropriate combustion technology. However, such biogas could be an excellent source of energy for combined heat and power (CHP) generation in palm oil mills. In this paper, the feasibility of using biogas from palm oil mills in flameless combustion systems is investigated. In computational fluid dynamic (CFD) modeling, a two-step reaction scheme is employed to simulate the eddy dissipation method (EDM). In such biogas flameless combustion, the temperature inside the chamber is uniform and hot spots are eliminated. The peak of the non-luminous flame volume and the maximum temperature uniformity occur under stoichiometric conditions when the concentration of oxygen in the oxidizer is 7%. In these conditions, as the concentration of oxygen in the oxidizer increases, the efficiency of palm oil mill effluent biogas flameless combustion increases. The maximum efficiency (around 61% in the experiment) is achieved when the percentage of oxygen in the oxidizer is 7%.",1
"This paper simulates the effect of a carbon tariff on China's trade of industrial products and emission reduction through the GTAP 8.0 model, when the European Union, the United States, and Japan impose a carbon tariff simultaneously or respectively. The conclusions indicate: (1) a carbon tariff will cause a decrease in exports for high-carbon industries and generate an increase in exports for low-carbon industries; (2) a carbon tariff will cause a greater reduction on imports for low-carbon industries than that for high-carbon industries; (3) a carbon tariff will also generate a noticeable increase in output for light industry and a decrease in output for heavy industry; and (4) a carbon tariff has an obviously positive effect on emission reduction for China's industrial sector, which bears the most responsibility of emission reduction. Based on these conclusions, this paper puts forward some corresponding policy suggestions.",1
"The objective of this research is to analyze by means of microscopic traffic flow simulation whether the integration of traffic emissions in the control criteria of a dynamic line control system can lead to a reduction in emissions. A traffic flow model of a German freeway, equipped with a dynamic line control system, is built and calibrated in PTV Vissim. The current control logic is implemented in Python and integrated into Vissim through the COM interface. The acceptance of the road users towards the displayed speed limits is investigated using measured traffic data from the examined section and is included in the model. Traffic emissions are determined during the simulation, and the control logic is adapted. We performed the emission assessment using the Handbook Emission Factors for Road Transport (HBEFA) for air emissions (CO2, NOx, and PM) and the German guidelines for noise protection on roads (RLS-90) for noise emissions. To evaluate the control logic's influence on resulting traffic emissions, the existing control logic, as it operates currently, is compared to altered control logics with additional consideration of emissions. An analysis of the emissions shows that the integration of pollution-based control criteria has a positive effect. All air and noise emissions can be slightly reduced by adjusting the control logic, with no significant changes in travel times.",1
"We show that renewable energy contributes to Europe's 2020 primary energy savings target. This contribution, which is to a large extent still unknown and not recognized by policy makers, results from the way renewable energy is dealt with in Europe's energy statistics. We discuss the policy consequences and argue that the 'energy savings' occurring from the accounting of renewable energy should not distract attention from demand-side energy savings in sectors such as transport, industry and the built environment. The consequence of such a distraction could be that many of the benefits from demand-side energy savings, for example lower energy bills, increase of the renewable energy share in energy consumption without investing in new renewable capacity, and long-term climate targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than 80%, will be missed. Such distraction is not hypothetical since Europe's 2020 renewable energy target is binding whereas the 2020 primary energy savings target is only indicative. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

"Regarding the predisposition of individuals to change when confronted with future climate scenarios, it is necessary to understand the perception of the groups under analysis and how to engage with society to collectively act toward climate change mitigation. A question remains to be answered: how to ensure that people engage, participate, and gain awareness of the undergoing problem that urban climate change poses for the future of cities' management? This research intends to contribute to solving this question by raising another question: How willing are residents of the Alvalade neighborhood (Lisbon) to change their behavior and way of life when faced with climate change scenarios? We present a methodology using microclimatic modeling with ENVI-met and questionnaires for the resident community. The present and future local climate scenarios (representing a present hot day versus the extreme IPCC RCP 8.5 scenario) were presented to a set of residents. These figures show the projected UTCI (Universal Thermal Climate Index) in a dramatic but accurate aggravated way. The inquiries allowed us to conclude that people are more aware of local climate change and health risks from extremely hot summer weather, but they continue to resist adopting behavior change for adaptation, although most of them declared this could be important to tackle climate change. The second conclusion is that people think that local authorities should be more active than themselves and will have greater responsibility for climate change adaptation and interventions. In times of climate crisis, the participation of the resident community can be an important help in decision making and finding measures to mitigate adverse climate effects in urban environments.",1
"The literature lacks enough evidence on the nexus of green finance and clean energy although the terms 'green' and 'clean' have been eminent concepts in sustainable development. Therefore, the fundamental objective of this study is to carry out the causal relationship among green finance, clean energy, environmental responsibility, and green technology by applying the novel time-varying causality test (Shi et al., 2018, 2020) on the daily data spanning from July 31, 2014, to October 12, 2021. The data follow persistent upward and downward movements; thus, the application of a time-varying approach should be reliable and robust. The recursive evolving and rolling window algorithms show bidirectional causalities among green finance, clean energy, environmental responsibility, and green technology, but not for the entire period, and with a special decrease and loss of significance in the COVID-19 period. In addition, clean energy caused by green finance is less evident, except in specific periods, especially at the start of the pandemic. However, higher volatility and significance of causality are observed for the entire period running from clean energy to green finance. Thus, green finance investments are promoted and proportionated by the need for clean energy. This study exhibits the need to design a comprehensive policy for strengthening environmental responsibility and green finance through the funding of green technology to successful energy transition and sustainable development goals.",1
"Successful renewable energy projects are crucial to bring the cleaner and sustainable environment of this universe. Owed to this, world's countries and policymakers are trying hard to double the current share of renewable energy consumptions (18.3%) by 2030, which has been resulting in the construction of multiple renewable energy projects. This study identifies multiple critical success factors (CSFs) and their influences mechanisms, required for renewable-energy projects. Using a sample of 272 firms working on renewable energy projects in Pakistan, a quantitative and causal study was undertaken to identify the efficiency (short-run success) and effectiveness (long-run success) mechanisms of critical success factors in renewable energy projects. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was applied to test and verify hypothesis. The results show that though the efficiency and effectiveness of critical success factors in renewable energy projects are equally important, the effectiveness (long-run success) in renewable energy projects is mainly depends upon the efficiency (short-run success) of the critical success factors (CSFs) involved in such kind of projects. The study expected to contribute towards and widen up the existing knowledge base for the renewable energy projects by adding on the findings regarding the influences mechanisms of critical success factors.

"Crop residue burning is a common practice in many parts of the world that causes air pollution and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Regenerative practices that return residues to the soil offer a 'no burn' pathway for addressing air pollution while building soil organic carbon (SOC). Nevertheless, GHG emissions in rice-based agricultural systems are complex and difficult to anticipate, particularly in production contexts with highly variable hydrologic conditions. Here we predict long-term net GHG fluxes for four rice residue management strategies in the context of ricewheat cropping systems in Eastern India: burning, soil incorporation, livestock fodder, and biochar. Estimations were based on a combination of Tier 1, 2, and 3 modelling approaches, including 100-year DNDC simulations across three representative soil hydrologic categories (i.e., dry, median, and wet). Overall, residue burning resulted in total direct GHG fluxes of 2.5, 6.1, and 8.7 Mg CO2-e in the dry, median, and wet hydrologic categories, respectively. Relative to emissions from burning (positive values indicate an increase) for the same dry to wet hydrologic categories, soil incorporation resulted in a -0.2, 1.8, or 3.1 Mg CO2e change in emissions whereas use of residues for livestock fodder increased emissions by 2.0, 2.1, or 2.3 Mg CO2e. Biochar reduced emissions relative to burning by 2.9 Mg CO2-e in all hydrologic categories. This study showed that the production environment has a controlling effect on methane and, therefore, net GHG balance. For example, wetter sites had 2.8-4.0 times greater CH4 emissions, on average, than dry sites when rice residues were returned to the soil. To effectively mitigate burning without undermining climate change mitigation goals, our results suggest that geographically-target approaches should be used in the rice-based systems of Eastern India to incentivize the adoption of regenerative 'no burn' residue management practices.",1
"East Kalimantan economy for four decades was mainly based on natural resources extraction and dominated by primary sectorwith the six highest GDP in 2013. But, the contribution of oil and gas were decreasing production due to the absence of new wells. One of the mission was create natural resources and renewable energy based economic people oriented. The Goverment of EK Province chose a strategy of socio-economic transformation based on renewable natural resources. This strategy has been applied in the regional development plan by mainstreaming climate change issues. Data related to energy source and its potential, remote rural electrification, bioenergy feedstock, etc including from the Palm Oil company was collected and subsequently analized in line with the EK Governor Letter. Currently (2014) available of Biogas-Pome as bioenergy feedstock is 162 million m 3 year(-1), where as currently utilized is only 22 millionm 3 year(-1). Power demand supply status in January 2015 indicated as available capacity is 467 MW where the peak demand is 444 MW. About 22% of households without electricity are difficult to be electrified without breakthrough efforts. About 215 thousand households are un-electrified, with more power need about 150 MW in total capacity. As business opportunity, high demand for rural electrification, particularly in Kutai Kartanegera, Kutai Timur, Kutai Barat, Berau and Paser.",1
"Temperature change can have profound impacts on livelihood activities and human well-being. Specific factors such as land transitions and climate knowledge can influence temperature variation and actions for adaptation. In addition to meteorological data, this study integrates land surface temperature (LST) derived from satellite imagery and local temperature perceptions obtained through interviews to advance a deeper understanding of spatial temperature and its impacts, which is not often seen within climate studies. This study examines local temperature across three different land types (rural mountains, rural agricultural lowlands, urban areas) in the Greater Angkor Region of Cambodia to highlight important insights about temperature and climate resilience action. The results revealed that changes in temperature were most pronounced in Phnom Kulen National Park (rural mountain) and in the rural agricultural lowlands, where residents discussed direct impacts and disruptions to their lives. Temperature, in both the LST results and through local perceptions, demonstrated a strong correlation to ground features, where areas with low vegetation exhibited high temperatures and areas with high vegetation observed low temperatures. While climate action in the form of tree planting and forest conservation are major climate mitigation strategies being undertaken in this region, social awareness and the ability to adapt to changes in temperature was revealed to be uneven across the landscape, suggesting that local entities should mobilize around gaining more education and training for all residents.",0
"The paper analyses the opportunity of 100% RES scenario promotion for R. Moldova. In this respect economic simulations are used. The paper shows that only 70% of the demand could he covered directly from wind farms and photovoltaic energy sources (WPES), the installed power of which should he 2.44 higher than the maximum power of annual demand. The remained 30% of energy (RE) - by energy storage system (ESS) with a capacity (kWh) of 32% from RE and a power (MW) of 87% from maximum power demand. As country doesn't have its own hydro reserves, Li-ion batteries are considered for ESS. The investment in such SSE would exceed 352 times national GDP and that makes unrealistic 100% RES scenario for R. Moldova. As analysis showed, there are more than 1400 cases/episodes within the year when energy to cover daily demand cannot be accumulated during 1 to 4 days. By reducing SSE capacity to a value equal to the daily energy demand and maintaining ESS power, it was found that the levelised tariff of WPES+ESS scenario exceeds, however, those of traditional scenarios. Only 5% of energy produced by WPES can be accumulated in such ESS, the remaining 25% - by importing electricity during the night when the price for electricity is the lowest, in the calculations above taken at negligible level. Subsequent improvement WPES+ESS scenario is seen by modifying WPES installed power, involving gas turbines, using ESS for system services.",1
"Energy is a preponderant element for the development of country's economy in the world.((1)) The production of energy has, for the most part relied on oil, coal and gas, which are non-renewable sources of energy. The oil prices fluctuation on the market affect these economies, including developing countries. Turning to renewable energy may become an alternative for those nations. In 2009, renewable energy supplied an estimated 16% of global final energy consumption counting traditional biomass, hydropower, wind, solar, geothermal, modern biomass, and biofuels. Total investment in renewable energy reached above $211 billion in 2010, up from $160 billion in 2009((2)) For Transforming from conventional to Renewable Energy some Strategy and policies has to be implemented in order to reduce existing barriers and promote technology innovation. Developing Countries who benefit on transferring from oil produced energy to Renewable Energy will be able to economy stabilization, reducing the burden due to oil price fluctuation, and green house gas reduction, being able to meets Kyoto Protocol requirement.((3)) Further more, renewable energy development has the potential to create new industries and generate millions of new directly and indirectly jobs, facilitating economy development.",1
"Agricultural areas under integrated production systems, such as Integrated Crop-Livestock-Forest System (CLFS), have the potential to sequestrate carbon (C) since both Soil Organic Matter (SOM) content and trees biomass increase thus mitigating the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) from agriculture. Regarding soil aspects, the C content stands out as the main indicator, but the structural aspect of SOM is also relevant since it plays a key role in the chemical stability of C compounds and the soil lifetime of C compounds. Laser-Induced Fluorescence Spectroscopy (LIFS) is an effective technique to evaluate the SOM humification index (HLIFS) from practically intact whole soil samples under different agricultural systems. Thus, the objective of this study was to analyze the SOM humification index in different integrated systems, such as Integrated Crop-Livestock-Forest System (CLFS), Integrated Livestock-Forest System (LFS), Integrated Crop-Livestock System (CLS), and in references areas, such as Intensive Pasture (INT), Extensive Pasture (EXT) and Native Forest (NF). For this purpose, samples of Redyellow Latosol (Haplorthox by Soil taxonomy) from the experimental site located at Embrapa Pecu ' aria Sudeste (Southeast of Brazil) were collected five years after the establishment of the integrated systems. Samples were collected at soil depths of 0-5, 5-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-40, 40-60, 60-80, and 80-100 cm. Pellets of the whole soil samples were prepared for LIFS analysis. In these areas, SOM humification indices (HLIFS) presented the following descending order: CLS > EXT > INT > LFS > CLFS > NF. Previous results have shown a greater soil organic carbon stock in these integrated production systems than in the NF area, suggesting C sequestration in agricultural soil. In the present study, SOM was classified by LIFS as more chemically stable in integrated production systems than in native vegetation. Higher amounts of fluorescent compounds were identified from LIFS data, probably resulting from condensed aromatic groups. SOM with more recalcitrant groups normally has a longer lifetime in the soil, indicating a long-term contribution to mitigating climate change by avoiding fast SOM decomposition and CO2 return to the atmosphere. Also, for the first time, this study was able to identify a positive correlation (R = 0.79) between the SOM humification index (HLIFS) and the Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC)/C content ratio of whole soil samples, another innovative contribution from soil LIFS analyses.",1
"Developing an inclusive policy agenda for ensuring sustainable development is a challenge for both developed and developing countries. The developing countries face challenges in designing policy that achieves sustainable development goals based on environmental awareness, and that is one of the main contributions of this research. By taking into account the SDG 13 (climate action) and 7 (clean and affordable energy) this study examines the influence of education, natural resource availability, financial development, urbanization, and economic growth for ASEAN nations from 1991 to 2018. For an empirical estimate, second-generation approaches are used. The findings demonstrate the energizing influence of renewable energy usage in altering the environmental quality. According to the empirical findings, renewable energy and education lower CO2 emissions by 0.46% and 0.22%, respectively. Financial development, urbanization, and natural resource depletion all have a 0.14%, 0.03%, and 0.08% impact on the environment, respectively. The heterogeneous causality analysis reveals the feedback effect, i.e., bidirectional causal links between education, carbon emissions, and the use of renewable energy. This empirical data implies that nations should enhance investment in renewable energy and education sectors, as well as prepare for renewable energy research and development, to ensure environmental sustainability. This research has policy implications for ASEAN countries in terms of renewable energy and education investments. Through this agenda, the objectives of SDG 13 and SDG 7 will be achieved, while SDG 4 will be targeted.",1
"In this work, a novel photoelectrochemical fuel cell consisting of a titanium dioxide nanotube array photosensitive anode and a platinum cathode was made for decomposing environmentally hazardous materials to produce electricity and clean fuel. Titanium dioxide nanotubes (TiO2 NTs) were prepared via electrochemical oxidation of pure Ti in an ammonium fluoride and glycerol-containing solution. Scanning electron microscopy was used to analyze the morphology of the nanotubes. The average diameter, wall thickness and length of the as-prepared TiO2 NTs were determined. The photosensitive anode made from the highly ordered TiO2 NTs has good photo-catalytic property, as proven by the decomposition tests on urea, ammonia, sodium sulfide and automobile engine coolant under ultraviolet (UV) radiation. To improve the efficiency of the fuel cell, doping the TiO2 NTs with a transition metal oxide, NiO, was performed and the photosensitivity of the doped anode was tested under visible light irradiation. It is found that the NiO-doped anode is sensitive to visible light. Also found is that polyaniline-doped photosensitive anode can harvest photon energy in the visible light spectrum range much more efficiently than the NiO-doped one. It is concluded that the nanostructured photoelectrochemical fuel cell can generate electricity and clean fuel by decomposing hazardous materials under sunlight. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

"In order to make optimal decisions for pricing and emission reduction, a remanufacturing supply chain system with dual-sale channels is investigated. With regard to the preferences of consumers for different channels and carbon cap-and-trade mechanisms, profit-maximization models are developed on supply chain members and systems in decentralized and centralized cases. Based on a backward induction, the corresponding formulae for decision variables are obtained. Then the effect of the industry emission control coefficient is analyzed and the optimal decisions of two cases are compared. Finally, the coordination mechanism and numerical analysis are presented. The result indicates that: (1) As the free carbon allowances granted by the government to the manufacturer increases, the investment in carbon reduction from the manufacturer will increase. As the industry emission control coefficient increases, the carbon emissions per product and the prices of new and remanufactured products will decrease, while the demands of the new and remanufactured products and the profits of supply chain members and systems will increase. (2) As the direct sale channel preference coefficient increases, the profits of the manufacturer and the system will increase while the retailer's profit will decrease. Correspondingly, the carbon emissions of unit product will decrease, and the sales of the direct sale channel will increase while the sales of the retail channel will decrease. (3) The decision in the coordinated case not only ensures emission reduction and system profit to reach the level of the centralized case, but also raises the profits of supply chain members in the decentralized case. Therefore, it is preferable to other decisions. (4) As the carbon trading price increases, the emission reduction investment from the manufacturer will increase while the profits of the supply chain and its members will increase.",1
"This work aims at developing a renewable energy storage solution, based on reversible solid oxide cell (rSOC) technology. Firstly, the initially high performing cells were tested as single cells with long-term reversible SOFC/SOEC load cycles as part of the test sequence. Secondly, similar cells were integrated in a stack design optimized for reversible operation at high degrees of utilization. The long-term single cell tests showed significant degradation in galvanostatic test periods during electrolysis but not in fuel cell mode prior to starting the reversible load cycling test part. The degradation diminished during the subsequent rSOC operation of the cells operating at 700 degrees C, +0.6 (SOFC) and -1.2 A cm(-2) (SOEC) at fuel utilization up to 80 % in both modes. The long-term stack tests were conducted applying different switches between SOFC and SOEC modes. Initially, long duration tests (100 h each mode) were performed at pH(2)O/pH(2): 50/50 to investigate effect of the polarisation only. The alternating cycle SOEC/SOFC was repeated over 1800 h of testing. Then stack switched daily from SOEC mode (8 h in pH(2)O/pH(2) : 90/10 at -0.84 A cm(-2)) to SOFC (16 h in H-2 at 0.26 A cm(-2)) for 500 h. Stack tests included reversible mode operation for up to several thousands of hours.",1
"The extension and development of energy saving buildings, green buildings and low carbon buildings have promoted the application of renewable energy. Shanghai has formulated a number of policies for the promotion of renewable energy in buildings. In this paper, the present status of the main renewable resources in Shanghai is introduced. Common application of renewable energy in buildings in Shanghai mainly focuses on the solar hot water (SHW) systems, solar photovoltaic (PV) system, ground source heat pump (GSHP) system. The above three forms of renewable energy application are discussed from two aspects of investment recovery period and energy saving. Suitability for the use of renewable energy in different building types is analyzed and suggestions are given to improve the comprehensive utilization of renewable energy.

"Due to the increased development of the smart grid, it is becoming crucial to have an efficient energy management system for a time-of-use (TOU) rate industrial user in Taiwan. In this paper, an extension of the direct search method (DSM) is developed to deal with the operating schedule of a TOU rate industrial user under the demand bidding mechanism of Taipower. To maximize the total incentive obtained from the Taiwan Power Company (TPC, namely Taipower), several operational strategies using a battery energy storage system (BESS) are evaluated in the study to perform peak shaving and realize energy conservation. The effectiveness of the proposed DSM algorithm is validated with the TOU rate industrial user of the TPC. Numerical experiments are carried out to provide a favorable indication of whether to invest in a BESS for the renewable energy-based TOU rate industrial user in order to execute the demand bidding program (DBP).",1
"With projected expansion of biofuel production at a global scale, there is a pressing need to develop adequate representation of bioenergy crops in land surface models to help effectively quantify the biogeophysical and biogeochemical effects of its associated land use changes. This study implements two new perennial bioenergy crops, Miscanthus and switchgrass, into the Community Land Model Version 5 based on site-level observations from the midwestern United States by modifying parameters associated with photosynthesis, phenology, allocation, decomposition, and carbon cost of nitrogen uptake and integrating concomitantly land management practices. Sensitivity analyses indicate that carbon and energy fluxes of the perennial crops are most sensitive to photosynthesis and phenology parameters. Validation of simulated fluxes against site-level measurements demonstrates that the model is capable of capturing the overall patterns of energy and carbon fluxes, as well as physiological transitions from leaf emergence to senescence. Compared to annual crops, perennial crops feature longer growing season, greater leaf areas, and higher productivity, leading to increased transpiration, lower annual runoff, and larger carbon uptake. The model simulations suggest that with higher CO2 assimilation rates and lower demands for nutrients and water, high-yielding perennial crops are promising alternatives of bioenergy feedstocks compared to traditional annual crops not only for mitigating climate change but also for environmental conservation purposes by reducing fertilizer application and therefore alleviating surface- and ground-water contaminations. Although the local-scale simulations shed light on potential benefits of using perennial grasses as bioenergy feedstocks, quantifying consequences of their plantations at larger scales warrants additional investigation.",1
"This study aims to measure the public's knowledge about renewable energy sources, their willingness to use solar energy as a main source in their households, and to understand their main motivation in undergoing (or not) such an energy shift; hence, potential influencing factors that will help win public support can be determined. A survey is tailored in order to capture relevant public belief, perception, and planned behavior, then a descriptive analysis of the data is performed to examine the associations between the willingness to use solar panels in households and the other explanatory variables. Initial results show that government policies and subsidies are main factors affecting the desire to adopt green energy. These results will help overcome obstacles that might be faced prior or during a transition to the Smart-Grid, especially in residential area.",1
"Biomass has been promoted as a promising energy resource to mitigate global climate change. To evaluate the contribution of biomass utilization to climate change mitigation under the Grain for Green program in Northern Shaanxi, China, a soil carbon dynamic model and a life cycle assessment model were integrated to examine the benefits of using Caragana korshinskii Kom. as an energy crop. We found that the annual dry biomass output is maintained at 0.7 Tg during the simulation period (2020-2097). Due to the compensatory effect of biomass regrowth, the global warming potential of biomass-derived CO2 emissions is approximately 0.045; therefore, the total annual biogenic CO2 emission is 57,211 +/- 6,168 Mg CO2 eq. The total annual life cycle CO2 emissions approach 867,072 Mg CO2 eq yr(-1). Under the scenario of no biomass removal, final carbon storage ranges from 15.7 to 19.3 TgC, and the highest carbon sequestration rate is 0.47 TgC yr(-1). In comparison with the no biomass removal scenario, the carbon sequestration rate (close to 0 MgC yr(-1)) in the biomass utilization scenario indicates a carbon loss; however, a portion of the carbon loss (31.39-62.09%) can be offset by carbon emission reductions from the substitution of fossil fuels.",1
"Most climate change mitigation scenarios rely on the incremental use of biomass as energy feedstock. Therefore, increasing the share of alternative sustainable energy sources as biomass is crucial to provide both peak and base electricity loads in future scenarios. The bioenergy potential of Ecuador has been addressed for agricultural by-products but not for dedicated bioenergy crops. Agricultural zoning studies have been developed for food crops but not for energy crops. Currently, the bioenergy share of electricity produced in Ecuador (1.4%) comes mainly from the use of sugar cane bagasse from sugar production. This study aims to identify potential sustainable bioenergy resources for continental Ecuador using agroecological zoning methodologies and considerations regarding land management, food security, in-direct land use change and ecological and climate change risks. The results identified 222,060.71 ha available to grow dedicated bioenergy crops and potential electricity production of 8603 GWh/year; giant reed ranks first with a potential net energy yield of 4024 GWh per year, and Manabi province presents the highest potential with 3768 GWh/year. Large-scale deployment of bioenergy in Ecuador would require the study of sustainability considerations of each project. The species studied are traditional bioenergy crops; research on novel species is encouraged.",1
"With the smart grid revolution, each house will have the ability to generate their own energy needs locally through renewable energy systems such as photovoltaic (PV) and wind turbines (WT). This paper presents the communication network architectures using both wireless and dedicated wired medium for monitoring and controlling the distributed energy systems (DES) including a small-scale WT and PV system. To monitor the condition of standalone system (PV and WT), the various types of sensors are used to collect different measurement data. The data transmission rate of each sensor is computed according to the sampling frequency. For DES in grid connected mode, the communication network of microgrid system is configured by hybrid architecture (wired-wireless). Based on network topology and different network configuration, OPNET modeler is used to evaluate the performance in view of total end-to-end delay using three different technologies; Ethernet based, Wi-Fi-based and ZigBee-based architectures.",1
"A new process for mine water purification has been proposed, based on biosorption followed by burning the loaded biosorbents. Wheat straw and sawdust of trees are convenient as biosorbents in the proposed process. Biosorption was performed in two stages: a cross-flow regime between the mine water and the biosorbent. The achieved copper adsorption degree was > 95%. Based on the mine water volume and its chemical composition, the estimated amount of the biosorbent was 60.000 t/year. The cogenerative mode of the loaded biosorbent combustion was considered for green energy production. For the recovery of metals concentrated in the ash, they must be processed separately. Several possibilities for ash processing were proposed and discussed. For an annual volume of mine water and the copper content in it, the mass and energy balances of the process were estimated, giving some economic data on the process efficiency. The analysis of the revenues and costs, based only on the energy value produced by the combustion of the biosorbent, has shown that the process can economically be viable regardless of the value of the recovered metal.",1
"This paper studies the knowledge spillovers generated by renewable energy technologies, unraveling the technological fields that benefit from knowledge developed in storage, solar, wind, marine, hydropower, geothermal, waste and biomass energy technologies. Using citation data of patents in renewable technologies filed at 18 European patent offices over the 1978-2006 period, the analysis examines the importance of knowledge flows within the same specific technological field (intra-technology spillovers), to other technologies in the field of power-generation (inter-technology spillovers), and to technologies unrelated to power-generation (external-technology spillovers). The results show significant differences across various technologies. Overall, patents in wind, storage and solar technologies tend to be more frequently cited than other technologies. While wind technologies mainly find applications within their own field, a large share of innovations in solar energy and storage technologies find applications outside the field of power generation. The paper discusses the implications of these results for policymaking. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",1
"To mitigate the impact of extended power outages from extreme weather events, utilities are trying to improve the existing restoration practices by adopting many emerging technologies. The coordination will be more complicated when emerging participants such as EVs are expected to provide grid services during restoration and customers are demanding less impact. In this paper, an integrated coordination formulation for service restoration, crew dispatch, and EV dispatch with distributed energy resources (DER) control is proposed. A unified routing-based model is used to model separate problems with the same set of equations to provide easy coordination. A novel routing-based EV dispatch formulation with two new tables - state of charge (SOC) status table and SOC exchange table - is proposed to track EV energy change during the routing process. The functional interdependencies among the sub-problems are investigated and leveraged and different DER control modes are developed and integrated. Case studies are conducted on the modified IEEE 123 node test system to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed model for capturing the interdependencies and demonstrate the concept of using EV and other emerging technologies for service restoration.",1
"Active methods for promoting gas hydrate formation, such as agitation, bubbling, and spraying, can lead to increased energy consumption and safety risks. Conversely, studies exploring chemical additives have been extensively reviewed, revealing that these methods often come with certain adverse effects, including reduced gas selectivity, increased mass transfer resistance and shortened lifespan of chemicals involved. However, these adverse effects could be potentially mitigated by using passive methods, which are promising to improve the safety, viability, scalability and lifespan of hydrate-based carbon capture. In this current review paper, passive methods refer to alterations within gas hydrate systems that stimulate hydrate formation without relying on nonmechanical or non-chemical techniques. These passive approaches encompass nano-confinement, surface treatment, suspended nanoparticles, and distributed hydrate systems. The promotion mechanisms, key features, limitations, and challenges associated with these passive methods are summarised in this paper, which provides guidance for the design of CO2 hydrate reactors for effective carbon capture.",1
"There is a wide consensus that a fundamental technology shift within the light duty vehicles (LDVs) sector is necessary to achieve the emissions reductions required for the Paris Agreement's targets, but substantial controversy prevails about the most suitable strategy. While some decision makers favor a transition to battery electric vehicles, others advocate for fuel cell vehicles and efuels. These strategies differ markedly in terms of consumer acceptance and implications for the energy system. We explore a range of electrification pathways in Europe until 2050. Direct electrification leads to a strong reduction in direct CO2 emissions of LDVs, with electric vehicles reaching 90% of sales in 2050. Indirect electrification places substantially higher pressure on the supply sector, with almost double the primary energy demand relative to direct electricity use. In addition, the implementation of complementary policies addressing perceived inconvenience markups for alternative mobility is crucial to initiate the mobility transformation.",1
"Cellulosic biofuels from non-food feedstocks, while appealing, continue to encounter uncertainty about their induced land use change (ILUC) effects, net greenhouse gas (GHG) saving potential and their economic costs. We analyse the implications of multiple uncertainties along the biofuel supply chain from feedstock yields, land availability for production to conversion to fuel in the refinery on these outcomes. We find that compared to corn ethanol, cellulosic biofuels have a substantially smaller and less uncertain ILUC-related GHG intensity and lead to larger GHG savings at lower welfare costs of abatement, indicating the potential to make robust and substantial contributions to cost-effective climate change mitigation.",1
"The need for climate change mitigation and to meet increasing energy demands has led to a rise in the land area under bioenergy crops in many countries. There are concerns that such large-scale land conversion will conflict with food production and impact on the environment. Perennial biomass crops could be grown on more marginal agricultural land. However, for sustainable solutions, biomass yields will need to be sufficient and the wider implications of land-use changes considered. Here, focusing on Miscanthus in England as an example, we combined an empirical model with GIS to produce a yield map and estimated regional energy generation potentials after masking out areas covered by environmental and socio-economic factors which could preclude the planting of energy crops. Agricultural land quality and the distributions of currently grown food crops were then taken into account. Results showed that: (i) regional contrasts occur in the importance of different factors affecting biomass planting; (ii) areas with the highest biomass yields co-locate with food producing areas on high grade land, and; (iii) when such high grade land and unsuitable areas are excluded, a policy-related scenario for increased planting on 350,000 ha utilised 4-28% (depending on the region) of lower grade land and would not necessarily greatly impact on UK food security. We conclude that the GIS-based yield and suitability mapping described here can help identify important issues in bioenergy generation potentials and land use implications at regional or finer spatial scales that would be missed in analyses at the national level.",1
"Global carbon emissions have reached unsustainable levels, and transforming the energy sector by increasing efficiency and use of renewables is one of the primary strategies to reduce emissions. Policy makers need to understand both the environmental and economic impacts of fiscal and regulatory policies regarding the energy sector. Transitioning to lower-carbon energy will entail a contraction of the fossil fuel sector, along with a loss of jobs. An important question is whether clean energy will create more jobs than will be lost in fossil fuels. This article presents a method of using Input-Output (I-O) tables to create synthetic industries - namely clean energy industries that do not currently exist in I-O tables. This approach allows researchers to evaluate public and private spending in clean energy and compare it to the effects of spending on fossil fuels. Here we focus on employment impacts in the short-to-medium term, and leave aside the long-term comparison of operations and maintenance employment. We find that on average, 2.65 full-time-equivalent (FIT) jobs are created from $1 million spending in fossil fuels, while that same amount of spending would create 7.49 or 7.72 FTE jobs in renewables or energy efficiency. Thus each $1 million shifted from brown to green energy will create a net increase of 5 jobs.",1
"Local implementation of international climate policies is frequently obscure. The objective of our research is to unpack the oblack boxo of carbon offsetting as it is being conducted in Latin American indigenous territories. Our two case studies of renewable energy projects under construction in Naso and Ngobe villages in western Panama show that carbon offsets in oppressive societies have the potential to cause social harm. Our cases illustrate processes of green authoritarianism, spatial control, and social restructuring. The private developers constructing the Chan 75 and Bonyic dams did not follow international standards for free, prior, and informed consent, and state agencies reinforced private rights with physical violence. As the hydro developers await decisions on their applications for verification under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), we recommend CDM procedural reforms to assure respect for human rights, including the special rights codified in the 2007 UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. If not, project developers could use low-carbon objectives to justify social oppression.",1
"Numerous scientific and official documents stress that energy efficiency improvements can play a key role in both assuring a sustainable energy future and mitigating climate change through socio-economic development. Last World Summit in Durban concluded that changing unsustainable patterns of energy use is a key area for global action to ensure the survival of our planet. This paper proposes a new Concept of five (5) Essentials of Application Engineering, (5 EAE), which would enable designers, manufacturers, and end-users to consistently design and evaluate any design or retrofits of power converters and/or industrial system drives. Five (5) essentials of application engineering have already been successful in designing and manufacturing integrated industrial system drives (IISD), and has created new basis-of-design for drives in mining and heavy industries in South Africa. 5 EAE, as a concept, produces several collateral benefits: 1) An increased technical and economic performance of processes; 2) The defusing of incipient energy and economic crisis; 3) An improvement of environmental conditions; and 4) The creation of jobs in industries. Consequently, 5 EAE can be used as a model for improving a company's corporate policies and/or utilities, and government energy policies.",1
"Coastal wetland restoration is an important activity to achieve greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets, improve water quality, and reach the Sustainable Development Goals. However, many uncertainties remain in connection with achieving, measuring, and reporting success from coastal wetland restoration. We measured levels of carbon (C) abatement and nitrogen (N) removal potential of restored coastal wetlands in subtropical Queensland, Australia. The site was originally a supratidal forest composed of Melaleuca spp. that was cleared and drained in the 1990s for sugarcane production. In 2010, tidal inundation was reinstated, and a mosaic of coastal vegetation (saltmarshes, mangroves, and supratidal forests) emerged. We measured soil GHG fluxes (CH4, N2O, CO2) and sequestration of organic C in the trees and soil to estimate the net C abatement associated with the reference, converted, and restored sites. To assess the influence of restoration on water quality improvement, we measured denitrification and soil N accumulation. We calculated C abatement of 18.5 Mg CO2-eq ha(-1) year(-1) when sugarcane land transitioned to supratidal forests, 11.0 Mg CO2-eq ha(-1) year(-1) when the land transitioned to mangroves, and 6.2 Mg CO2-eq ha(-1) year(-1) when the land transitioned to saltmarshes. The C abatement was due to tree growth, soil accumulation, and reduced N2O emissions due to the cessation of fertilization. Carbon abatement was still positive, even accounting for CH4 emissions, which increased in the wetlands due to flooding and N2O production due to enhanced levels of denitrification. Coastal wetland restoration in this subtropical setting effectively reduces CO2 emissions while providing additional cobenefits, notably water quality improvement.",1
"Growing energy demand has increased interest in marine renewable energy resources (i.e., wave energy, which is harvested through wave energy converter (WEC) arrays. However, the wave energy industry is currently at a significant juncture in its development, facing a number of challenges which require that research re-focuses on a holistic techno-economic perspective, where the economics considers the full life cycle costs of the technology. It also requires development of WECs suitable for niche markets, because in Europe there are inequalities regarding wave energy resources, wave energy companies, national programs and investments. As a result, in Europe there are leading and non-leading countries in wave energy technology. The sector also needs to increase confidence of potential investors by reducing (non-)technological risks. This can be achieved through an interdisciplinary approach by involving engineers, economists, environmental scientists, lawyers, regulators and policy experts. Consequently, the wave energy sector needs to receive the necessary attention compared to other more advanced and commercial offshore energy technologies (e.g., offshore wind). The formation of the first open pan-European network with an interdisciplinary approach will contribute to large-scale WEC array deployment by dealing with the current bottlenecks. The WECANet (Wave Energy Converter Array Network) European COST Action, introduced in September 2018 and presented in this paper, aims at a collaborative and inclusive approach, as it provides a strong networking and collaboration platform that also creates the space for dialogue between all stakeholders in wave energy. An important characteristic of the Action is that participation is open to all parties interested and active in the development of wave energy. Previous activities organised by WECANet core group members have resulted in a number of joint European projects and scientific publications. WECANet's main target is the equal research, training, networking, collaboration and funding opportunities for all researchers and professionals, regardless of age, gender and country in order to obtain understanding of the main challenges governing the development of the wave energy sector.",1
"There is a clear need for transformative change in the land management and food production sectors to address the global land challenges of climate change mitigation, climate change adaptation, combatting land degradation and desertification, and delivering food security (referred to hereafter as land challenges). We assess the potential for 40 practices to address these land challenges and find that: Nine options deliver medium to large benefits for all four land challenges. A further two options have no global estimates for adaptation, but have medium to large benefits for all other land challenges. Five options have large mitigation potential (>3 Gt CO(2)eq/year) without adverse impacts on the other land challenges. Five options have moderate mitigation potential, with no adverse impacts on the other land challenges. Sixteen practices have large adaptation potential (>25 million people benefit), without adverse side effects on other land challenges. Most practices can be applied without competing for available land. However, seven options could result in competition for land. A large number of practices do not require dedicated land, including several land management options, all value chain options, and all risk management options. Four options could greatly increase competition for land if applied at a large scale, though the impact is scale and context specific, highlighting the need for safeguards to ensure that expansion of land for mitigation does not impact natural systems and food security. A number of practices, such as increased food productivity, dietary change and reduced food loss and waste, can reduce demand for land conversion, thereby potentially freeing-up land and creating opportunities for enhanced implementation of other practices, making them important components of portfolios of practices to address the combined land challenges.",1
"Africa has the potential to base a significant proportion of its development on renewable energy. Business models will be instrumental to this end because they are among the key drivers of the energy sector's growth. This study performs the first systematic literature review of renewable energy business models in Africa to assess their types, why they are adopted, and factors affecting their viability. It also investigates whether the value created translates into social, economic, and environmental sustainability. Findings show that existing research has focused on the technical, social, and economic dimensions of renewable energy business models, mainly for energy access, without analysing their environmental sustainability. The commercial viability of the business models for solar home systems and pico systems in the reviewed studies rests largely on reducing their upfront cost through innovative payment plans for customers. The commercial viability of mini-grids depends on demand stimulation, for example through encouraging end-users to start businesses that benefit from electrification projects. Incentivising the adoption of energy-using products further increases the average consumption and revenue per user and, hence, the viability of mini-grids. Unaffordability, unmet energy needs, low demand for electricity, lack of finance, business models that are unfamiliar to customers, and market immaturity are the common challenges to energy access in Africa. Our review shows that research in this area needs to integrate environmental sustainability for a more holistic approach to informing decision-making. The synthesised evidence provided here can be used by policymakers to understand the needs of Africa's renewable energy sector across the three sustainability domains.",1
"Background: Sustainable management of the natural environment is essential. Continued environmental degradation will lead to worsened health outcomes in countries and across generations. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide a framework for viewing the preservation of natural environments and the promotion of health, wellbeing and health equity as interconnected pursuits. Within the SDG framework the goals of promoting environmental sustainability and human health are unified through attention to the social determinants of health and health equity (SDH/HE). This paper presents findings from a document analysis of all Australian environment sector policies and selected legislation to examine whether and how current approaches support progress toward achieving SDG goals on water, climate change, and marine ecosystems (Goals 6, 13 and 14), and to consider implications for health and health equity. Results: Consideration of a broad range of SDH/HE was evident in the analysed documents. Related collaborations between environment and health sectors were identified, but the bulk of proposed actions on SDH/HE were initiated by the environment sector as part of its core business. Strengths of Australian policy in regard to SDGs 6, 13 and 14 are reflected in recognition of the effects of climate change, a strong cohesive approach to marine park protection, and recognition of the need to protect existing water and sanitation systems from future threats. However, climate change strategies focus predominately on resilience, adaptation and heat related health effects, rather than on more comprehensive mitigation policies. The findings emphasise the importance of strengthened cross-sectoral action to address both the drivers and effects of environmental degradation. A lack of policy coherence between jurisdictions was also evident in several areas, compounded by inadequate national guidance, where vague strategies and nonspecific devolution of responsibilities are likely to compromise coordination and accountability. Conclusions: Evidence on planetary health recognises the interconnectedness of environmental and human health and, as such, suggests that ineffective management of climate change and water pose serious risks to both the natural environment and human well-being. To address these risks more effectively, and to achieve the SDGs, our findings indicate that cross-jurisdiction policy coherence and national coordination must be improved. In addition, more action to address global inequities is required, along with more comprehensive approaches to climate change mitigation.",1
"International agreements to reduce the emission of acidifying sulphur (S) and nitrogen (N) compounds have been negotiated on the basis of an understanding of the link between acidification related changes in soil and surface water chemistry and terrestrial and aquatic biota. The quantification of this link is incorporated within the concept of critical loads. Critical loads are calculated using steady state models and give no indication of the time within which acidified ecosystems might be expected to recover. Dynamic models provide an opportunity to assess the timescale of recovery and can go further to provide outputs which can be used in future emission reduction strategies. In this respect, the Target Load Function (TLF) is proposed as a means of assessing the deposition load necessary to restore a damaged ecosystem to some predefined acceptable state by a certain time in the future. A target load represents the deposition of S and N in a defined year (implementation year) for which the critical limit is achieved in a defined time (target year). A TLF is constructed using an appropriate dynamic model to determine the value of a chemical criterion at a given point in time given a temporal pattern of S and N deposition loads. A TLF requires information regarding: (i) the chemical criterion required to protect the chosen biological receptor (i.e. the critical limit), (ii) the year in which the critical limit is required to be achieved; and (iii) time pattern of future emission reductions. In addition, the TLF can be assessed for whole regions to incorporate the effect of these three essentially ecosystem management decisions.",1
"In this article, a high step-up hybrid Y-source-quasi-Z source dc-dc converter is obtained by combining the topology of Y-source and quasi-Z source. The proposed converter inherits all the advantages of Y-source and quasi-Z source converter, namely continuous input current, common ground between input and output voltages, built-in step-down transformer, low voltage stress of switch, and low output diode current stress. In addition, the proposed converter has high voltage gain and conversion efficiency. The steady-state analysis and voltage and current stress derivation are presented. A numerical design of the components is conducted. The loss distribution is precisely calculated. The conversion efficiency at different voltage gains was also investigated. A small signal model is composed. Then the stability of the system is studied and optimized by PID compensator. Finally, a 160-W prototype made in the laboratory verified the effectiveness of the proposed converter, and the efficiency reached 95.201% when operating at rated output power. The proposed converter has the highest experimental efficiency with respect to the other compared converters.",0
"Owing to the growing importance of socially responsible investments in the wake of climate change mitigation goals, we estimate the asymmetric time- and frequency-spillovers between global sustainable investments. Additionally, we examine the influence of global risk factors such as US and UK economic policy uncertainties, stock market volatility, US treasury market volatility and infectious diseases related market volatility on the short- and long-run connectedness in these investments. To this end, we use daily returns and volatilities of 14 country-level Dow Jones Sustainability Indices from January 2005 to March 2021. By employing the asymmetric versions of Diebold & Yilmaz (2012, 2014) and Barunik & Krehlik (2018) time-frequency connectedness, our study addresses both good and bad contagion among sustainable investments that is unexplored in the recent literature. The results reveal significant time-frequency asymmetries in return spillovers across different regions in the short- and long-run. Germany, France, Netherlands, and the UK are the primary shock transmitters. We find more intra-regional connectedness among the Asian countries as opposed to inter-regional connectedness. Negative returns propagate more intensely than positive ones, and this contagion is considerably boosted during crises, including the COVID19. The VIX and COVID19 remain influential in the long run. The impact of MOVE is positive in the short-run while negative in the long-run, which shows an overreaction of connectedness to the US treasury market volatility in the short-run. Economic policy uncertainties in the US and the UK increase spillovers more intensely in the short-run. These results are robust to using volatility spillovers, the choice of rolling window and various forecast horizons. Our findings are distinctly important for socially responsible investors as we point out international portfolio diversification opportunities among sustainable investments. Understanding the dynamics of connectedness in sustainable investments can potentially boost financing in this market through portfolio choices and contribute to the climate change mitigation agenda of the United Nations.",1
"Biochar may contribute to climate change mitigation at negative cost by sequestering photosynthetically fixed carbon in soil while increasing crop yields. The magnitude of biochar's potential in this regard will depend on crop yield benefits, which have not been well-characterized across different soils and biochars. Using data from 84 studies, we employ meta-analytical, missing data, and semiparametric statistical methods to explain heterogeneity in crop yield responses across different soils, biochars, and agricultural management factors, and then estimate potential changes in yield across different soil environments globally. We find that soil cation exchange capacity and organic carbon were strong predictors of yield response, with low cation exchange and low carbon associated with positive response. We also find that yield response increases over time since initial application, compared to non-biochar controls. High reported soil clay content and low soil pH were weaker predictors of higher yield response. No biochar parameters in our dataset-biochar pH, percentage carbon content, or temperature of pyrolysis-were significant predictors of yield impacts. Projecting our fitted model onto a global soil database, we find the largest potential increases in areas with highly weathered soils, such as those characterizing much of the humid tropics. Richer soils characterizing much of the world's important agricultural areas appear to be less likely to benefit from biochar.",1
"Increasing attention is being paid to the Paris Climate Agreement and the impacts of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) intended to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees C. However, the nature and evolution of existing policy mixes that underlie NDCs remain poorly understood. This critical issue has emerged from the outcomes of the Talanoa Dialogue for Climate Ambition, where little progress was made in building a comprehensive, evidence-based foundation for effective climate policy. To a large extent, this is due to the nature of the process, and a lack of data related to policy interventions in the pre-2020 period, notably their composition, coverage, and orientation. We seek to address these shortcomings by applying a directed content analysis to a dataset of national and city-level policy interventions. The aim is to quantify the nature and evolution of policy efforts that promote the adoption of low-carbon energy technologies (LCETs) globally. Fifteen databases, containing more than 10,000 policies and measures were reviewed. Our findings highlight the rapid spread of policy portfolios and an international convergence towards economic incentives (notably subsidies). At the city level, technology and infrastructure policies dominate. However, it is unclear to what extent behavioural factors (i.e., cognitive, motivational and contextual aspects) that affect the choice and use of LCETs are taken into account in policy design. This is particularly important because studies that model the feasibility of the 1.5 degrees C target reveal behavioural changes and the rapid adoption of low-carbon lifestyles as critical enabling factors. In response to the outcomes from the Talanoa Dialogue, we argue that policymakers need to go beyond stringent policy mixes and rapidly re-think their traditional economic-driven policymaking approach. Far more attention needs to be given to behavioural factors when designing, evaluating and implementing LCET policies.",1
"Paper presents decoupled variable (adjustable) speed generation system and its application in renewable energy generation. The decoupled generation system consists of internal combustion engine, permanent magnet generator and AC/AC converter. Performance of single decoupled generation set are discussed supported by results of laboratory tests. The variable speed system provides high quality voltage in wide speed range when the step of load is low. However, when the step load is significant the voltage drop is not acceptable. Therefore to provide high quality produced voltage an additional energy storage, made from supercapacitor and bidirectional DC/DC converter, is applied. Such system performs very stiff voltage in any load condition. Integration of renewable wind energy system is provided via DC link of the variable speed decoupled autonomous generation system. The priority of the power draw is from the wind source. This is assured by a method of three reference signals for the DC link voltage. Speed control of the driving engine in region of low specific fuel consumption results in high efficiency conditioning of the unstable (wild) variable renewable energy source.",1
"Electrical energy obtained from state-owned electricity company is often can not fulfill the electrical energy required by the industry during peak load. Another problem that industry faced is the availability of electrical energy supply is not continuous. Solution to this problem, the industry needs another source of electrical energy so the availability of electrical energy can be achieved. This study presents the analysis of reliability improvement for 20 kV distribution system which connected to state-owned electricity company's Distributed Generation (DG) in Karawang Industrial Region. Analysis of this study is using DG with new and renewable energy sources, solar panel and batteries systems, it is aimed to increase the reliability of each load (industry) and determines the cost to build the DG. The reliability calculation is done by using DigSILENT software both before and after the DG installation. Calculation analysis of solar panel system's components is calculated using Microsoft Excel software. Followed by calculating Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) as a value indicating the cost required to generate power per kWh so we can determine the selling price per kWh by state-owned electricity company for the Industry in order to fulfill the DG development cost.",1
"The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is an oil-rich country located in the eastern part of the Arabian Peninsula. Abu Dhabi is the largest emirate in the country, and Abu Dhabi is the capital of the UAE. The country has the one of the highest per capita rates of CO2 emission and water consumption in the world. Most of the water consumed is produced in desalination plants, which are energy intensive. The leadership of the country has made the bold decision to establish a renewable energy (RE) sector to diversify its energy sources and the economy as a whole. The Masdar Initiative was established to promote this objective. The government has established its first RE policy; the goal is to have 7% of power come from RE sources and technologies by 2020. This paper highlights the different RE projects of the Masdar Initiative, with particular emphasis on the power sector, and examines the new concentrated solar power (CSP) plants developed as part of the initiative.

"The Levant area of the Middle East suffers from both chronic water scarcity and high population growth. It is also a region highly dependent of fossil fuels. In order to address current and expected water demands, several countries in the region, including Israel, Jordan and the Palestinian Authority (PA), are depending increasingly on desalination, which is expected to intensify energy consumption and energy related emissions. Given that the region also benefits from high levels of solar irradiation nearly year-round, much attention has been given to the possibility of developing renewable energy in general and for desalination specifically. This paper presents partial results of a pre-feasibility study assessing the prospects of transfers of desalinated water from Israel and/or the PA, which have access to the Mediterranean Sea, to Jordan, in exchange for renewable solar-produced electricity from Jordan, which, unlike its neighbors, has an abundance of available open space suitable for solar production. The analysis shows that single-axis tracking photovoltaic (PV) systems appear to be the most economically feasible option. Moreover, the study shows that the proposed idea of international cooperation and water-energy exchanges, while facing political obstacles, could provide numerous economic, environmental and geopolitical benefits to all parties involved. As such, an arrangement such as that examined may be a more promising means of promoting both desalination and renewable energy than if each country unilaterally develops desalination and renewable energy in isolation from one another.",1
"The present paper investigates the influence of renewable energy consumption (REC), economic growth (GDP), financial development index (FDI), z-score (ZS) and control of corruption (CC) on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, for eighteen different APEC economies over the period 2000-2019 using the Pooled Mean Group-Autoregressive Distributed Lags (PMG-ARDL) approach and Granger causality tests. The outcomes of the empirical study confirm that the variables are cointegration using Pedroni tests. The long-run estimates revealed that economic growth and renewable energy contribute to the huge of carbon emissions, while financial development, ZS and CC lead to decrease carbon emissions. Granger causality shows that, in the long-run, there is bidirectional causality between CO2 emissions, economic growth, and financial development. In the short-run and for basic variables, Granger shows a unidirectional causality from CO2 emissions and economic growth to REC and; unidirectional causality from financial development, ZC and CC to CO2 emissions. A comprehensive approach is needed in APEC countries to effectively reduce CO2 emissions and promote sustainable development, including encouraging green financial products, reinforcing financial regulations, transitioning to a low-carbon economy, enhancing renewable energy usage, and improving governance and institutional quality, while considering the distinctive characteristics of each country.",1
"Background: Communication about climate change is critical in addressing the greatest public health challenge of our time. Public health professionals must convey the human implications of climate change and educating populations regarding climate change as a threat to the health and wellbeing of people globally. Effective communication to engage individuals, communities, and populations is critical to debate as we focus on the most urgent public health problem of our time. Objective: Public health professionals are aware of the deleterious health consequences related to climate change; however, key segments of the population are not. This paper addressed key concepts related to climate change communication. Methods: Databases were searched including PubMed, CINAHL, and Scopus from 2015 to 2020 to obtain the most recent relevant literature using search terms that included climate change, climate communication, climate action, and climate change engagement. Findings: Climate change communication as viewed through the lens of Six Americas-a national survey that categorized people regarding their beliefs about climate change from those who are Dismissive, Doubtful, Disengaged, Cautious, Concerned, or Alarmed is a valid perspective for engaging populations in climate communication and climate action. Conclusions: Using the framework developed by the George Mason University Center for Climate Change Communication and the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, we suggest that adopting this framework from a US perspective to a global perspective and surveying across countries and context is imperative to advance global understanding of the impact of climate change on health.",0
"To mitigate the climate change effects of transportation, the US states of California and Oregon, the Canadian province of British Columbia, and the European Union have implemented regulations to reduce the life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions intensity of transport fuel, commonly referred to as carbon intensity, or CI. In this article, we unpack the theory and practice of fuel CI standards, examining claims regarding climate change mitigation. We show that these standards do not reliably mitigate climate change because estimates of GHG reductions rely primarily on models that are not designed to estimate changes in emissions and climate impacts. Some regulations incorporate models that estimate a subset of changes in emissions, but the models must project changes in global markets over decades, and there is little agreement about the best model structure or parameter values. Since multiple models and projections may be equally plausible, fuel CI is inevitably subjective and unverifiable. We conclude that regulating or taxing observable emissions would more reliably achieve emission reduction.",1
"The storage of CO2 has become an important worldwide problem, considering that an excess of CO2 in the Earth's atmosphere causes dramatic changes in its climate. One possible solution is to remove the excess of CO2 from the atmosphere, capture it in the process of creation, and store it safely, negating the possibility of its return into the atmosphere. This is the process of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). In the following paper, the authors investigate horizontal saline aquifers and their ability to store CO2. The authors' application of sensitivity analysis on horizontal migrations uncovered that CO2 permeability and aquifer porosity have a considerable impact on horizontal migrations. During the migration process, CO2 can reach tens of kilometers from its injection point. By introducing effective CO2 density to the conduction velocity term, the authors showcase that the convection-diffusion equation for compressible fluids can be replaced with the equation for incompressible fluids. The buoyancy factor in convective velocity is as density dependent as in conduction velocity. By means of introducing an effective density to the aforementioned term, the process of transport via variable convective velocity can be substituted for a process which is effective, constant, and not density dependent.",1
"Integration of renewable energy and optimization of energy use are key enablers of sustainable energy transitions and mitigating climate change. Modern technologies such the Internet of Things (IoT) offer a wide number of applications in the energy sector, i.e, in energy supply, transmission and distribution, and demand. IoT can be employed for improving energy efficiency, increasing the share of renewable energy, and reducing environmental impacts of the energy use. This paper reviews the existing literature on the application of IoT in in energy systems, in general, and in the context of smart grids particularly. Furthermore, we discuss enabling technologies of IoT, including cloud computing and different platforms for data analysis. Furthermore, we review challenges of deploying IoT in the energy sector, including privacy and security, with some solutions to these challenges such as blockchain technology. This survey provides energy policy-makers, energy economists, and managers with an overview of the role of IoT in optimization of energy systems.",1
"Many oil and gas (O&G) companies began, in recent years, to increase their renewable and low-carbon energy (R&LCE) operations - crucial for climate mitigation. In Scotland, renewable electricity generation has tripled since 2009. However, this progress remains insufficient to meet carbon reduction targets. More effective public policies are needed to accelerate this trend while meeting energy needs and retaining energy industry employment, which is essential for a just transition. This study analyzes drivers of O&G industry investment into R&LCE to understand how government intervention can steer corporate decision-making. We develop and apply a conceptual framework of drivers of decisions for such investments. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 12 individuals in strategic positions working in O&G companies in Scotland, which are exemplary of similar O&G-intensive regions in the global North. We find that the energy transition narrative within the industry mostly supports developing R&LCE projects that build on existing O&G assets and expertise, such as blue hydrogen and carbon capture and storage. Industry-wide narratives encourage investment in R&LCE across the sector, not only in companies facing the most scrutiny. The findings suggest the need to tailor public policy to increase the pressure of drivers of change, including increasing restrictions on access to financial capital for O&G, emphasizing narratives that promote R&LCE, and working to lower the costs of accessing expertise and retraining employees in R&LCE technology. Transitioning employment without job loss through retraining workers synergizes private and social interests, so an emphasis on (re)training and education for capacity building can be an immediate successful policy approach for a just transition. Diverse factors influence O&G companies' decision-making on R&LCE.O&G industry perceives government support (fiscal and non-financial, like knowledge-exchange networks) is important to drive private investment in R&LCE.Industry paradigm evolving towards a more favourable view of the energy transition.Industry perceives the need to continue O&G production alongside emissions-reduction technology (CCS and blue hydrogen).Key factors to facilitate the transition are individual leadership and retraining to retain employment.",1
"This paper examines the relationship between renewable, non-renewable energy, natural resources, human capital, and globalization on ecological footprint from 1990 to 2016 for developing countries. We apply Westerlund co-integration technique to check the long-run relationship among the variables. The long-run elasticity of the model is analyzed through MG, AMG, and DCCE. For the robustness check of the long-run relationship among the variables, we use FMOLS and DOLS approach. The direction of causal relationship is determined through Dumitrescu and Hurlin causality test. Our findings revealed that economic growth, non-renewable energy, natural resource, and urbanization are inducing the ecological footprint of developing countries and reducing the environment's quality. To cope up with this situation, developing countries are bound to use more fossil fuel energy. The use of non-renewable energy consumption leads to increase the extraction of natural resources like coal and oil. However, renewable energy reduces the ecological footprint or improves environmental quality. Similarly, human capital and globalization have negative effects on ecological footprint. The results of causality test reveal that there are feedback effects between ecological footprint with economic growth, globalization, and natural resources. This study suggests that these developing countries should focus more on the investment in the renewable energy sector, improve quality education, and make stringent environmental policy for protecting the nations from ecological issues.",1
"Understanding and managing soil organic carbon stocks (SOCS) are integral to ensuring environmental sustainability and the health of terrestrial ecosystems. The information of soil bulk density (BD) is important in accurately determining SOCS while it is often missing in the soil database. Using 3,504 soil profiles (14,170 soil samples) that represented diverse regions across China, we investigated the effectiveness of various pedotransfer functions (PTFs), including traditional PTFs, machine learning (ML), and ensemble model (EM), in predicting BD. The results showed that refitting the parameter(s) in traditional PTFs was essential for BD prediction (coefficient of determination (R 2 ) of 0.299 -0.432, root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.156 -0.162 g cm-3 , Lin 's concordance coefficient (LCCC) of 0.428 -0.605). Compared to traditional PTFs, ML can greatly improve the model performance for BD prediction with R 2 of 0.425 -0.616, RMSE of 0.129 -0.158 g cm-3 and LCCC of 0.622 -0.765. Our results also showed that EM can further improve BD prediction by ensembling four ML models (R 2 = 0.630, RMSE = 0.126 g cm-3 , LCCC = 0.775). Using the EM model, we filled the missing BD (1207 soil profiles with 3,112 soil samples) in our database and built the SOC stock database (4,275 soil profiles with 17,282 soil samples). This study can be a good reference for gap-filling the missing BD depending on the data availability, thus contribute to a deeper understanding in soil C related climate change mitigation, ecological balance preservation and environmental sustainability promotion.",1
"The technology transfer for rural livelihood development had greater impact to protect microclimatic conditions which further affects the microflora and microbial activities to larger extent in the Indian Himalayan Region (IHR). The technological interventions were made by the Himalayan Research Group organization which helped in economic upliftment of rural poor, women empowerment and in environment protection in hill region. The major activities are Passive Solar Retrofitting (namely, Thermosyphoning Air heat Panel (TAP), Trombe Wall (TW), and Sun Spaces (SS)) fodder development, vermicompost biotechnology, button mushroom cultivation and protected cultivation for climate change mitigation and adaptations. The solar retrofits reduced estimated 4.97 tones carbon emission per household during six winter months which helped in reducing the fuel wood consumption. Improved varieties of different fodder spp. were introduced for year round green fodder availability and reduce soil erosion and reduction in tree lopping. Fodder choppers and silage preparation was popularized to contain the fodder wastage. Vermicompost biotechnology was popularized among farmers to reduce the use of chemical fertilizers for improving the quality of soil. The button mushroom cultivation was used for conversion of agriculture residue into compost making by reducing crop residue burning which increases carbon emission. Protected cultivation in local made polyhouse was popularized to generate maximum returns from small piece of land through cut flower and vegetable cultivation and by raising plant nurseries.",1
"Efforts to meet climate change mitigation and energy security targets spur investments in variable renewable energy sources. Their implications for the operation of power plants are frequently investigated drawing on unit commitment and dispatch models. However, the temporal granularity and operational detail these models consider is commonly omitted in the broader family of long-term energy system models. To compensate this short-coming, these two types of tools have sometimes been 'soft-linked' and harmonised for limited simulation years. This paper assesses an alternative approach. We examine an extended version of an open source energy system model (0SeMOSYS), which is able to capture operating reserve and related investment requirements within a single tool. The implications of these model extensions are quantified through comparison with an Irish case study. That case study examined the effects of linking a long-term energy system model (TIMES) with a unit commitment and dispatch model (PLEXOS). It analysed the year 2020 in detail, applying a yearly temporal resolution that is over 700 times higher than in OSeMOSYS. Without increasing temporal resolution (and computational burden) we show that results of the enhanced OSeMOSYS model converge to results of TIMES and PLEXOS: Investment mismatches decrease from 21.4% to 5.0%. The OSeMOSYS analysis was then extended to 2050 to assess the implications of short-term variability on future capacity investment decisions. When variability was ignored, power system investments in 2050 were found to be 143% lower. This might imply that energy policies derived from such long-term models - of which there are many - may underestimate the costs of introducing variable renewables and thus meeting climate change or energy security targets.

"Scholars concerned with abuses of the resource privilege by the governments of developing states sometimes call for national sovereignty over the natural resources that lie within its borders. While such claims may resist a key driver of the resource curse when applied to mineral resources in the ground, and are often recognized as among a people's territorial rights, their implications differ in the context of climate change, where they are invoked on behalf of a right to extract and combust fossil fuels that is set in opposition to global climate change mitigation imperatives. Moreover, granting full national sovereignty over territorial carbon sinks may conflict with commitments to equity in the sharing of national mitigation burdens, since much of the planet's carbon sink capacity lies within territorial borders to which peoples have widely disparate access. In this paper, I shall explore this tension between a global justice principle that is often applied to mineral resources and its tension with contrary principles that are often applied to carbon sink access, developing an analysis that seeks to reconcile what would otherwise appear to be fundamentally incompatible aims.",1
"Background Global progress in the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) requires significant national and international research efforts and collaboration. The current study aimed to provide policymakers, academics, and researchers with a snapshot of global SDGs-related research activity. Method This was a cross-sectional descriptive bibliometric study. SciVerse Scopus was used to retrieve SDGs-related research publications for the period from 2015 to 2019. Results In total, 18,696 documents were found. TheSustainabilityjournal ranked first (n = 1008; 5.4%) in the number of SDGs-related publications. The World Health Organization was the most active institution in publishing SDGs-related documents (n = 581; 1.3%). Most of the retrieved documents belonged to SDG 17 (partnership) followed by SDG 13 (climate action), and SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production), while SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy) had the least number of publications. The European region (n = 9756; 52.2%) had the highest research contribution while the Eastern Mediterranean region (n = 1052; 5.6%) had the least contribution. After exclusion of SDG 17, the SDG 3 (good health and well-being) was the top researched SDG for the African region, the Eastern Mediterranean regions, and the South-Eastern Asian region. For the region of the Americas, European region, and the Western Pacific region, the SDG 13 (climate action) was the most researched. The SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy) was the least researched in the African region, the region of the Americas, the European region, and the South-East Asian region. In the Eastern Mediterranean region, SDG 10 (reduced inequality) was the least researched while in the Western Pacific region, SDG 5 (gender inequality) was the least researched. The most researched targets of SDG 3 were targets 7 (sexual and reproductive health services) and 8 (universal health coverage) while the least researched targets were 5 (substance use disorders) and 9 (death from hazardous materials). International research collaboration within SDG 3 between high- and low-income countries was inadequate. Conclusion The analysis presented in the current study are useful for researchers, institutes, governments, funding agencies, and policy-makers. Countries in Africa, the Middle East, and South-East Asia need to increase their funding and research collaboration in the field of SDGs.",1
"Rare earth elements (REEs) are key ingredients in many advanced materials used in energy, military, transportation, and communication applications. However, the prevailing geopolitical dynamics and the rising demand for REEs have rendered the reliance on primary REE resources susceptible to future supply disruptions, posing a substantial risk to the availability of these elements for numerous applications. Therefore, it is imperative to undertake substantial initiatives in the extraction of REEs from secondary sources on a large scale to ensure the resilience of the supply chain. Permanent magnets, lighting phosphors, and nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) batteries are among the secondary sources with high potential for sustainable REE extraction. This review assesses the extraction potential of REEs from the aforementioned three secondary sources and their leaching kinetics and thermodynamics aspects. More importantly, state-of-the-art different existing kinetic models employed in rare earth (RE) leaching were well discussed for a better understanding of the REE leaching reactions. Furthermore, the optimized leaching parameters related to this kinetics were described, and various RE recovery methods were comprehensively summarized. These processes facilitate to managing one of the fastest-growing solid waste streams by minimizing environmental impacts and producing critical metals, including REEs via circular economy approaches. The recovery of REEs from secondary sources aligns with numerous United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly in the renewable energy sector for climate change mitigation. Consequently, this trash-to-treasure urban mining concept to transforming e-waste into a valuable resource for REE recovery emerges as a pivotal element within the REE industry.",1
"Although there is evidence that CO2-efficiency enhancing innovations in one country diffuse into other countries to contribute to the goals of climate change mitigation, very little is known about the conditions under which such international spillovers are most likely to take place. Our contribution in the present article seeks to address this gap by examining whether the strength of cross-border CO2-efficiency spatial dependence working through import ties and inward foreign direct investment (FDI) stocks is greater in (a) countries with lower existing levels of domestic CO2-efficiency and (b) countries with greater social capabilities in terms of a better educated workforce and higher institutional quality. We find that less CO2-efficient countries and countries with higher institutional quality experience stronger FDI-weighted CO2-efficiency spillovers, whereas a higher level of human capital increases receptivity to import-weighted international spillovers.",1
"In a world where the construction industry is increasingly under the spotlight for its environmental impact, the demand for innovative design approaches has reached unprecedented levels. In response, this paper introduces an innovative design methodology that combines shape and topology optimization, with a focus on mitigating climate change and enhancing buildability, in the context of shell structures. Shape optimization typically involves refining existing designs, while topology optimization focuses on identifying optimal material layouts. Our methodology synergizes these two approaches, enabling the optimization of shape and material distribution, while considering Global Warming Potential and Buildability. This research contributes to advancing the ongoing transformation in spatial structures by topology informed shell structures, emphasizing the environmental challenges.",1
"Peatlands cover only about 3% the global land area, but store about twice as much carbon as global forest biomass. If intact peatlands are drained for agriculture or other human uses, peat oxidation can result in considerable CO(2)emissions and other greenhouse gases (GHG) for decades or even centuries. Despite their importance, emissions from degraded peatlands have so far not been included explicitly in mitigation pathways compatible with the Paris Agreement. Such pathways include land-demanding mitigation options like bioenergy or afforestation with substantial consequences for the land system. Therefore, besides GHG emissions owing to the historic conversion of intact peatlands, the increased demand for land in current mitigation pathways could result in drainage of presently intact peatlands, e.g. for bioenergy production. Here, we present the first quantitative model-based projections of future peatland dynamics and associated GHG emissions in the context of a 2 degrees C mitigation pathway. Our spatially explicit land-use modelling approach with global coverage simultaneously accounts for future food demand, based on population and income projections, and land-based mitigation measures. Without dedicated peatland policy and even in the case of peatland protection, our results indicate that the land system would remain a net source of CO(2)throughout the 21st century. This result is in contrast to the outcome of current mitigation pathways, in which the land system turns into a net carbon sink by 2100. However, our results indicate that it is possible to reconcile land use and GHG emissions in mitigation pathways through a peatland protectionandrestoration policy. According to our results, the land system would turn into a global net carbon sink by 2100, as projected by current mitigation pathways, if about 60% of present-day degraded peatlands would be rewetted in the coming decades, next to the protection of intact peatlands.",1
"Hybrid organizational forms combine values and practices from different institutional domains, rendering them difficult to fit neatly into the structures of extant organizational forms. Since the work required to institutionalize a new hybrid organizational form may be beyond the resources and capabilities of individual organizations acting alone, we shift the focus to inter-organizational collective action. Using empirical data from a study of a European network of renewable energy cooperatives, we find that, in order to institutionalize the new hybrid organizational form, the network can contribute to overcome the legitimacy challenges inherent in organizational hybridity. In particular, the network builds field-level receptivity to institutional pluralism, collectively codifies the hybrid organizational form, and consolidates legitimation towards plural field-level audiences. In order to perform these institutionalization roles, the network itself becomes increasingly formalized and mobilizes mediating functions involving different types of resources, legitimacy and target audiences. The research advances knowledge of hybrid organizational forms and their collective institutionalization through inter-organizational networks.",0
"The clean development mechanism (CDM), one of the flexible mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol, has received noticeable attention in China. In this paper, the project of waste gases utilization for Combined Cycle Power Plant in Handan Iron & Steel Group Co., Ltd is used as a CDM case to reveal the CO2 emission reduction and the mitigation cost per unit CO2. The analyses are conducted based on using the methodology ACM0004 of Clean Development Mechanism for the estimation of CO2 emission reduction. Moreover, a mitigation cost analysis is also carried out. The results show that the mitigation cost per unit CO2 is 6.23 $/t, and the emission reduction of CO2 per year is 665,545 CO(2)te. Given that the results of the financial analysis conducted clearly show that the implementation of this type of waste gases recovery and utilization project is not the economically most attractive course of action in China. With the revenue from the sale of Certified Emission Reduction (CERs), the proposed project will be investment attractive.",1
Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector may be the most difficult aspect of climate change mitigation. We suggest that carbon neutral hydrocarbons (CNHCs) offer an alternative pathway for deep emission cuts that complement the use of decarbonized energy carriers. Such fuels are synthesized from atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and carbon neutral hydrogen. The result is a liquid fuel compatible with the existing transportation infrastructure and therefore capable of a gradual deployment with minimum supply disruption. Capturing the atmospheric CO2 can be accomplished using biomass or industrial methods referred to as air capture. The viability of biomass fuels is strongly dependent on the environmental impacts of biomass production. Strong constraints on land use may favour the use of air capture. We conclude that CNHCs may be a viable alternative to hydrogen or conventional biofuels and warrant a comparable level of research effort and support.,1
"In climate simulations we find a pronounced meridional (equator to pole) gradient of climate response to land cover change. Climate response approaches zero in the tropics, and increases towards the poles. The meridional gradient in climate response to land cover change results from damping feedbacks in the tropics, rather than from polar amplification. The main cause for the damping in the tropics is the decrease in cloud cover after deforestation, resulting in increased incoming radiation at the surface and a lower planetary albedo, both counteracting the increase in surface albedo with deforestation. In our simulations, deforestation was also associated with a decrease in sensible heat flux but not a clear signal in evaporation. Meridional differences in climate response have implications for attribution of observed climate change, as well as for climate change mitigation strategies.",1
"Fossil fuel-dependency has induced a trade-off between economic growth and environmental degradation across the developing nations in particular. Against this backdrop, this study aims to evaluate the impacts of renewable energy use on the ecological footprints in the context of four South Asian fossil fuel-dependent nations: Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. The econometric analysis involves the use of recently developed methods that account for cross-sectional dependency, slope heterogeneity, and structural break issues in the data. The results reveal that renewable energy consumption reduces the ecological footprints while nonrenewable energy use boosts the ecological footprints. The results also confirm the validity of the environmental Kuznets curve and pollution haven hypotheses for the panel of the South Asian nations. Besides, foreign direct investment inflows are found to degrade the environment while higher institutional quality improves it. Furthermore, unidirectional causalities are run from overall energy use, economic growth, and institutional quality to ecological footprints. At the same time, bidirectional associations between foreign direct investment inflows and ecological footprints are also ascertained. The overall findings highlight the pertinence of reducing fossil fuel-dependency, enhancing economic growth, restricting dirty foreign direct investment inflows, and improving institutional quality to ensure environmental sustainability across South Asia.",1
"Widespread adoption of the Internet has transformed how most US political advocacy organizations operate, but perhaps more important has been the formation of new types of advocacy organizations. These 'Internet-mediated advocacy organizations' tend to have smaller, geographically dispersed and networked staffs, behave as hybrids of traditional political organizations, and emphasize the use of online tools for offline action. The climate change debate has spurred formation of many such organizations - including 350.org - that now advocate for climate action alongside legacy/environmental organizations. How do these organizations differ from their legacy/environmental counterparts? What does their rise mean for climate change political advocacy? I explore these and other questions through in-depth interviews with top online strategists and other staffers at Environmental Defense Fund, Natural Resources Defense Council, Sierra Club, Greenpeace USA, Energy Action Coalition, 1Sky, and 350.org. Interviews revealed broad agreement among Internet-mediated/climate groups regarding core strategic assumptions about climate advocacy, but some divergence among legacy/environmental organizations. They also revealed connections between these assumptions, audience segment targeting, and strategic use of the Internet for advocacy. I discuss implications for the future of US climate advocacy.",1
"In the process of global environmental governance, renewable energy (RE) has been the focus of government attention as an effective avenue to enhance environmental sustainability. Hence, this paper utilises the rolling-window Granger causality test to probe the connection between RE and sustainable development (SD) and further probe whether RE can be a solution to reduce air pollution and boost ecological sustainability. The results reveal that RE has both positive and negative impacts on SD, which means that RE can effectively mitigate the ecological burden and progress toward SD in a certain period. This favourable impact supports the conclusions of the energy-environment model, which indicates that the increasing share of RE is beneficial to improving environmental benefits. Conversely, the rise in SD drives more sustainable investment in clean energy projects and further contributes to RE generation growth. However, economic and government policy changes will affect sustainable investment in the renewable sector and transmit negative shocks to RE development. In the context of the increasingly severe environmental situation, the government should take some proactive measures favouring RE development and ecological sustainability to mitigate ecological deterioration and boost environmental quality.",1
"The world's energy needs have been continually growing over the past decade, yet fossil fuels are limited. Renewable energies are becoming more prevalent, but are still a long way from being commonplace worldwide. Literature mining is applied to review carbon capture and storage (CCS) development trends and to develop and examine a novel carbon capture and storage technological paradigm (CCSTP), which incorporates CCSTP competition, diffusion and shift. This paper first provides an overview of the research and progress in CCS technological development, then applies a techno-paradigm theory to analyze CCSTP development and to provide a guide for future CCS technological trends. CCS could avoid CO2 being released into the atmosphere. Moreover, bioenergy with CCS (BECCS) can make a significant contribution to a net removal of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. In this study, we compare the different CCSTP developmental paths and the conventional techno-paradigm by examining the S-curves. The analyses in this paper provide a useful guide for scholars seeking new inspiration in their research and for potential investors who are seeking to invest research funds in more mature technologies. We conclude that political barriers and public acceptance are the major distinctions between the CCSTP and the conventional techno-paradigm. It is expected that policy instruments and economic instruments are going to play a pivotal role in the accomplishment of global carbon reduction scenarios.",1
"Renewable energy is accepted as a key source for the future, not only for Turkey, but also for the world. Turkey has a considerably high level of renewable energy resources that can be a part of the total energy network in the country. The main objective in doing the present study is to investigate the historical development of Turkey's renewable energy sources given Turkey's energy-related studies during 1853-2002. The following resources were taken into consideration: hydro energy, solar energy, geothermal energy, wind energy, and biomass. The first small hydroelectric power plant (SHPP) with a capacity of 88 kW was installed in Tarsus-Adana, Turkey in 1902. In the period of the Republic of Turkey, the utilization of hydroelectric power was first initiated in 1929 with the establishment of the Visera power plant with a capacity of I MW in the city of Trabzon. In the early 1960s, solar energy was realized as an alternative energy in Turkey, and some curious researchers and dissertation students began to be interested in the solar energy matter. The first national congress on solar energy was performed in 1975 in Izmir Turkey. The inventorial works and chemical analyses of the hot springs and mineral waters started in 1962, while the investigations on geothermal energy in the country gained speed in the 1970s. The first residential geothermal heat pump system (or ground-source heat pump system) was installed in a villa in Istanbul in 1998. Electricity generation through wind energy for general use was first realized at Cesme Altinyunus Resort Hotel (The Golden Dolphin Hotel) in Izmir Turkey in 1986 with a 55 kW nominal wind energy capacity. In Turkey, much effort has been put into biogas research and development projects since the 1960s, while studies on energy forests began scientifically in 1980 with the Fourth Five-Year Development Plan. It is expected that this study will fill a considerably large gap since it is the first attempt towards reviewing these resources in terms Of the history.",1
"Carbon markets afford potentially useful opportunities for supporting socially and environmentally sustainable land management programs but, to date, have been little applied in globally significant fire-prone savanna settings. While fire is intrinsic to regulating the composition, structure and dynamics of savanna systems, in north Australian savannas frequent and extensive late dry season wildfires incur significant environmental, production and social impacts. Here we assess the potential of market-based savanna burning greenhouse gas emissions abatement and allied carbon biosequestration projects to deliver compatible environmental and broader socio-economic benefits in a highly biodiverse north Australian setting. Drawing on extensive regional ecological knowledge of fire regime effects on fire-vulnerable taxa and communities, we compare three fire regime metrics (seasonal fire frequency, proportion of long-unburnt vegetation, fire patch-size distribution) over a 15-year period for three national parks with an indigenously (Aboriginal) owned and managed market-based emissions abatement enterprise. Our assessment indicates improved fire management outcomes under the emissions abatement program, and mostly little change or declining outcomes on the parks. We attribute improved outcomes and putative biodiversity benefits under the abatement program to enhanced strategic management made possible by the market-based mitigation arrangement. For these same sites we estimate quanta of carbon credits that could be delivered under realistic enhanced fire management practice, using currently available and developing accredited Australian savanna burning accounting methods. We conclude that, in appropriate situations, market-based savanna burning activities can provide transformative climate change mitigation, ecosystem health, and community benefits in northern Australia, and, despite significant challenges, potentially in other fire-prone savanna settings.",1
"Non-continuous flooding is an effective practice for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and irrigation water use (IRR) in rice fields. However, advancing global implementation is hampered by the lack of comprehensive understanding of GHGs and IRR reduction benefits without compromising rice yield. Here, we present the largest observational data set for such effects as of yet. By using Random Forest regression models based on 636 field trials at 105 globally georeferenced sites, we identified the key drivers of effects of non-continuous flooding practices and mapped maximum GHGs or IRR reduction benefits under optimal non-continuous flooding strategies. The results show that variation in effects of non-continuous flooding practices are primarily explained by the UnFlooded days Ratio (UFR, that is the ratio of the number of days without standing water in the field to total days of the growing period). Non-continuous flooding practices could be feasible to be adopted in 76% of global rice harvested areas. This would reduce the global warming potential (GWP) of CH4 and N2O combined from rice production by 47% or the total GWP by 7% and alleviate IRR by 25%, while maintaining yield levels. The identified UFR targets far exceed currently observed levels particularly in South and Southeast Asia, suggesting large opportunities for climate mitigation and water use conservation, associated with the rigorous implementation of non-continuous flooding practices in global rice cultivation.",1
"Due to the increasing global importance of decarbonizing human activities, especially the production of electricity, the optimal deployment of renewable energy technologies will play a crucial role in future energy systems. To accomplish this, particular attention must be accorded to the geospatial and temporal distribution of variable renewable energy sources (VRES), such as wind and solar radiation, in order to match electricity supply and demand. This study presents a techno-economical assessment of four energy technologies in the hypothetical context of Mexico in 2050, namely: onshore and offshore wind turbines and open-field and rooftop photovoltaics. A land eligibility analysis incorporating physical, environmental, and sociopolitical eligibility constraints and individual turbine and photovoltaic park simulations, drawing on 39 years of climate data, is performed for individual sites across the country in an effort to determine the installable potential and the associated levelized costs of electricity. The results reveal that up to 54 PWh of renewable electricity can be produced at a levelized cost of electricity of less than 70 EUR center dot MWh(-1). Around 91% (49 PWh) of this electricity would originate from 23 TW of open-field photovoltaic parks that could occupy up to 578,000 km(2) of eligible land across the country. The remaining 9% (4.8 PWh) could be produced by 1.9 TW of onshore wind installations allocated to approximately 68,500 km(2) of eligible land that is almost fully adjacent to three mountainous zones. The combination of rooftop photovoltaic and offshore wind turbines accounts for a very small share of less than 0.03% of the overall techno-economical potential.",1
"The design and operation of cost-effective power systems and high penetration of renewable energy and energy storage require a modeling approach that simultaneously reflects the system's reality. Although power systems with high penetration of renewable energy and energy storage have been analyzed in the past, more systematic analysis are in need to determine the impact of generation units' techno-economic parameters on the model's accuracy. This study investigated the effects of the techno-economic and spatial-temporal parameters, which will be referred to as combined techno-economic parameters, via seven scenarios. The combined techno-economic effects were demonstrated on optimal generation mix, renewable curtailments, variability status of storage units, and energy cost. The omission of combined techno-economic parameters results in the renewable generation to be more visible and with less curtailment while significantly decreasing the share of energy storage and decreasing the energy cost by 1.53 USD/MWh. As a result, if power systems assessment dismissed the evolving techno-economic and spatial-temporal parameters, the precision of cost-benefit analysis can be compromised, thus affecting the decision-making in terms of directing projects, regulations, and policies within the power industry.",1
"Mitigating climate change requires clean energy and the removal of atmospheric carbon. Building soil carbon is an appealing way to increase carbon sinks and reduce emissions owing to the associated benefits to agriculture. However, the practical implementation of soil carbon climate strategies lags behind the potential, partly because we lack clarity around the magnitude of opportunity and how to capitalize on it. Here we quantify the role of soil carbon in natural (land-based) climate solutions and review some of the project design mechanisms available to tap into the potential. We show that soil carbon represents 25% of the potential of natural climate solutions (total potential, 23.8 Gt of CO2-equivalent per year), of which 40% is protection of existing soil carbon and 60% is rebuilding depleted stocks. Soil carbon comprises 9% of the mitigation potential of forests, 72% for wetlands and 47% for agriculture and grasslands. Soil carbon is important to land-based efforts to prevent carbon emissions, remove atmospheric carbon dioxide and deliver ecosystem services in addition to climate mitigation. Diverse strategies are needed to mitigate climate change. This study finds that storing carbon in soils represents 25% of land-based potential, of which 60% must come from rebuilding depleted carbon stores.",1
"Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) are tradable units that represent the commodity in the form of environmental attributes generated for each unit of electricity produced by a renewable energy source. Furthermore, the energy sector's digitalization ushers in new crucial enablers like Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), which may be used for REC record tracking and trading. Unfortunately, there are a number of outstanding issues such as the lack of a common standard for the representation, communication, and verification of REC, reliance on centralized entities, and others. In order to harness the true potential of energy DLT and REC, it is imperative to address these issues. In this visionary article, we propose a holistic approach which leverages a novel decentralized identity mechanism called Self-sovereign Identity (SSI) and DLT. We present its architecture, based on a rigorous threat model and requirement analysis as well as detailed use-cases to illustrate how the architecture can be used in different REC use-cases.",0
"Nuclear energy plays a crucial role in mitigating climate change as a near carbon-free and clean energy source. Predicting operating parameters is key to the digitalization and intellectualization of nuclear power plants, improving energy efficiency and reducing costs. Parameter prediction methods mainly consist of model-driven and data-driven approaches, and a comparative study is necessary to select the appropriate prediction method or combine them. In this paper, the gated recurrent unit network and the thermal-hydraulic program RELAP5 are chosen as representative data-driven and model-driven approaches to be used for predicting parameters for a specific operating condition to assess the characteristics and capabilities of each. The chosen experiment is a steam generator tube rupture accident which is important to pressurized water reactors. In this paper the modelling process and the prediction results for both approaches are given. The correlation coefficient for dome pressure, dome temperature, and primary outlet temperature of both approaches is greater than 0.993, except that the correlation coefficient of downcomer temperature is 0.83865 using RELAP5 and 0.99392 using gated recurrent unit network. Then the two approaches are compared from six perspectives of practical application, including accuracy (gated recurrent unit network and RELAP5 received scores of 8 and 6, respectively.), data requirements (7 and 5, respectively), model building algorithm (7 and 5, respectively), prediction speed (10 and 6, respectively), expertise requirements (6 and 6, respectively), and interpretability (5 and 9, respectively). It shows that model-driven and data-driven approaches both require specialist knowledge and appropriate data for modelling process. The data-driven gated recurrent unit network exhibits better accuracy and higher speed. The model-driven RELAP5 has better interpretability compared to the black-box gated recurrent unit network. It is suggested that hybrid approaches of model-driven and data-driven approaches could better deal with the prediction problems.",1
"Clean energy technology is a new energy technology that is developed with good environmental benefits in terms of renewable energy and efficient clean utilization of coal. The industrial park clean energy technology promotion mechanism is an evolutionary game process between an industrial park management committee and a clean energy technology supplier. Based on the basic principles of evolutionary game, this paper constructs a clean energy technology promotion mechanism, analyzes the factors affecting the strategic choice of industrial park management committee and clean energy technology supplier, and constructs industrial park management committee and clean energy technology supplier game matrix under different strategies. Through theoretical analysis and numerical simulation, provides recommendations for the promotion of clean energy technologies.",1
"This paper analyses climate science as a discourse to reveal how it enables and constrains climate change negotiations and action. Focusing on long-term outcomes projected in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Fifth Assessment Report and the World Bank's Turn Down the Heat reports, this paper examines processes of discourse structuration and institutionalization to identify the dominant discourses which frame climate action. We trace the dominant discourses identified in the scientific reports - Survivalism, Ecological Modernisation and Economic Rationalism - through the Paris Agreement and selected Leader Statements and Intended Nationally Determined Contributions from COP21. From the 24 states included in this analysis, Papua New Guinea (PNG) is developed as a case study to investigate the hybridity and institutionalization of discourses. Even though PNG's rhetoric and commitments at COP21 express Survivalism, the state's policy frameworks rarely move beyond solutions found in Economic Rationalism and Ecological Modernisation. This suggests that states strategically adopt hybrid discourses drawn from climate science in line with their positionality, political economy and interests. Understanding how discourses drawn from climate science manifest in national policies has significant implications not only for how science is communicated at the international level but also for understanding different state positions in the global climate governance regime.",1
"The proliferation of markets and market-based policy instruments in environmental governance is premised on the establishment of metrological regimes and the practices of measurement, commensuration, and commodification that underlie these regimes. This paper develops the concept of metrology and examines its role in the function and dysfunction of emissions trading markets. The concept invites us to question the social, political, and scientific conditions under which agreements about measurement and commensuration do or do not occur, and the consequences or effects of particular metrological systems. The paper provides three examples of how measurement, commensuration, and commodification have framed the design and function of emissions markets in order to illustrate the effects of particular metrologies on market rule. Contrary to claims that measurement serves as a means to 'cool' political disputes, this paper argues that because markets inevitably have distributional effects, the metrological systems which frame market design are frequently a site of focused political contestation. Seeing measurement and commensuration as inherently political can also provide insight into ongoing disagreements about the appropriate metrics and responsibilities for mitigating climate change and the form and function of markets more generally.",1
"During the COVID-19 epidemic, draconian countermeasures forbidding nonessential human activities have been adopted in several countries worldwide, providing an unprecedented setup for testing and quantifying the current impact of humankind on climate and for driving potential sustainability policies in the postpandemic era from a perspective of complex systems. In this study, we consider heterogeneous sources of environmental and human activity observables, considered as components of a complex socioenvironmental system, and apply information theory, network science, and Bayesian inference to analyze their structural relations and nonlinear dynamics between January 2019 and August 2020 in northern Italy, i.e., before, during, and after the national lockdown. The topological structure of a complex system strongly impacts its collective behavior; therefore, mapping this structure is essential to fully understand the functions of the system as a whole and its fragility to unexpected disruptions or shocks. To this aim, we unravel the causal relationships between the 16 environmental conditions and human activity variables, mapping the backbone of the complex interplay between intervening physical observables-such as NO2 emissions, energy consumption, intervening climate variables, and different flavors of human mobility flows-to a causal network model. To identify a tipping point during the period of observation, denoting the presence of a regime shift between distinct network states (i.e., before and during the shock), we introduce a novel information-theoretic method based on statistical divergence widely used in statistical physics. We find that despite a measurable decrease in NO2 concentration, due to an overall decrease in human activities, locking down a region as a climate change mitigation is an insufficient remedy to reduce emissions. Our results provide a functional characterization of socioenvironmental interdependent systems, and our analytical framework can be used, more generally, to characterize environmental changes and their interdependencies using statistical physics.",1
"Over the past two decades, scholars and practitioners across the social sciences, policy and beyond have proposed, trialled and developed a wide range of theoretical and practical approaches designed to bring about changes in behaviors and lifestyles that contribute to climate change. With the exception of the establishment of a small number of iconic behaviors such as recycling, it has, however, proved extremely difficult to bring about meaningful transformations in personal greenhouse gas emissions at the individual or societal level, with multiple reviews now pointing to the limited efficacy of current approaches. We argue that the majority of approaches designed to achieve mitigation have been constrained by the need to operate within prevailing social scientific, economic and political orthodoxies which have precluded the possibility of non-marginal change. In this paper, we ask what a truly radical approach to reducing personal emissions would look like from social science perspectives which challenge the unstated assumptions severely limiting action to date, and which explore new alternatives for change. We emphasize the difficulties likely to impede the instituting of genuinely radical societal change with respect to climate change mitigation, while proposing ways that the ground could be prepared for such a transformation to occur.",1
"As a part of climate change mitigation plans in Europe, CO2 storage scenarios have been reported for the United Kingdom and the European Union with injection rates reaching 75 - 330 MtCO2 yr(-1) by 2050. However, these plans are not constrained by geological properties or growth rates with precedent in the hydrocarbon industry. We use logistic models to identify growth trajectories and the associated storage resource base consistent with European targets. All of the targets represent ambitious growth, requiring average annual growth in injection rates of 9% - 15% from 2030 to 2050. Modelled plans are not constrained by CO2 storage availability and can be accommodated by the resources of offshore UK or Norway alone. Only if the resource base is significantly less, around 10% of current estimates, does storage availability limit mitigation plans. We further demonstrate the use of the models to define 2050 rate targets within conservative bounds of both growth rate and storage resource needs.",1
"Whether China can slow the growth of emissions of greenhouse gases and ultimately reduce them has become a central question for climate mitigation. In previous research on India, we developed a theoretical framework to assess the structural characteristics of different sectors and identify which ones were most amenable to mitigation. In this article, we extend that approach to China and review the nine sectors responsible for most of the country's emissions. These include electricity (disaggregating renewables, nuclear, and coal), road transportation, four disaggregated industry sub-sectors (steel, cement, fertilizers, and oil refining), and buildings. We identify two sets of attributes, what we called political/organizational feasibility and techno-economic feasibility, that together shape the possibilities for emissions mitigation. Our central intuition is that fragmentation - on the government or market side or both - makes collective action more difficult. Cement, steel, and oil refining possess favorable characteristics on both political/organizational feasibility and techno-economic feasibility, while fertilizers and renewables pose the most difficult challenges on both dimensions. Buildings and road transport are mixed cases, where techno-economic feasibility is high while political/organizational dynamics are more challenging. Finally, coal and nuclear are mixed cases where political/organizational feasibility is high but techno-economic aspects are more challenging.",1
"The rapid depletion of fossil fuels and the growing awareness of environmental protection have led to the energy crisis. As a result, researchers are working to find new ways to extract energy from renewable resources. And with the advancement of energy markets, the value of incorporating different green sources into energy systems has grown in popularity. These hybrid systems can overcome the limitations of individual production technologies (such as generators, gas turbines, nuclear power, etc.), in terms of improving energy efficiency, in terms of respect of environment (reduction of CO2 emissions), financial aspects, flawless quality, and adaptability. The main motivation of this study was to present a technique to optimize the integration of wind and solar energy in the electrical system in Algeria site (Naama). In this study, we will analyze the impact of the integration of this renewable energy (wind/solar) on the problem of economic dispatch, where it has been solved with two methods of optimizations PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization), and GWO (Gray Wolf Optimizer), and finally, a comparison is made between the two methods.",1
"Over the past 10 years, in most countries of Europe, North America and China, renewable energy grid integration technical standards are mostly developed by some electricity association or power grid companies. However, with the increasing scale of renewable energy generation and gradually intensified impact on the power grid, more countries confirm the legitimacy of renewable energy grid integration provisions through the legislation in national level. Due to the difference in the power source structure, load characteristics, power grid situation, and other specific circumstances in different countries or regions, grid code of renewable energy integration in different countries are not identical. However, these technical standards have some common focuses. They all stressed that the renewable energy power plants must have a certain active power control, reactive power / voltage control and fault ride through capability as well as the ability to withstand the power system voltage and frequency deviation. Some of the standards require the renewable energy power plants to provide model information, operating parameters and grid integration performance testing reports. This paper provides an introduction about common focus on technical standards of renewable energy grid integration, and tries to explore potential challenge caused by RE grid integration",1
"Information design has become a tool to enhance the communication of process-and systems-oriented information. Environmental awareness can be promoted through information design (Bartusch & Porathe, 2011). With regard to renewable energy, these aspects of information design need to coincide. Renewable energy sources play a key role in the EU's circular economy package and energy policy targets (COM, 2015). Also rural actors should be encouraged to use renewable energy (Chel & Kaushik, 2011). They should have access to simple and comparable information. Well-executed information design when planning, shaping and visualizing data could provide solutions for this dilemma (Coates & Allison, 2014). This paper deals with the opportunities of using information design as a tool to process and produce more understandable information about rural renewable energy possibilities to better meet the information needs of rural actors. In this study, data is produced in two forms of visualization: posters and animations.",1
"We present a stochastic decision-making algorithm for the design and operation of a carbon capture and storage (CCS) network; the algorithm incorporates the decision-maker's tolerance of risk caused by uncertainties. Given a set of available resources to capture, store, and transport CO2, the algorithm provides an optimal plan of the CCS infrastructure and a CCS assessment method, while minimizing annual cost, environmental impact, and risk under uncertainties. The model uses the concept of downside risk to explicitly incorporate the trade-off between risk and either economic or environmental objectives at the decision-making level. A two-phase-two-stage stochastic multi-objective optimization problem (2P2SSMOOP) solving approach is implemented to consider uncertainty, and the s-constraint method is used to evaluate the interaction between total annual cost with financial risk and an Eco-indicator 99 score with environmental risk. The environmental impact is measured by Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) considering all contributions made by operation and installation of a CCS infrastructure. A case study of power-plant CO2 emission in Korea is presented to illustrate the application of the proposed modeling and solution method. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",1
"The development of the marine renewable energy and offshore aquaculture sectors is susceptible to being affected by climate change. Consequently, for the long-term planning of these activities, a holistic view on the effects of climate change on energy resources and environmental conditions is required. Based on present climate and future climate scenario, favourable conditions for wind and wave energy exploitation and for farming six marine fish species are assessed using a suitability index over all European regional seas. Regarding available energy potential, the estimated changes in climate do not have direct impacts on the geographic distribution of potential regions for the energy industry (both wind and wave based), that is they pose no threat to this industry. Long-term changes in environmental conditions could however require adaptation of the aquaculture sector and especially of its exploitation areas. Opportunities for aquaculture expansion of the assessed species are identified. Possibilities for co-location of these activities are observed in the different climate scenarios. The evaluation of potential zones for the exploitation of marine renewable energy resources and offshore aquaculture represents a stepping-stone, useful for improving decision-making and assisting in the management of marine economies both in the short-term and in the long-term development of these sectors.",1
"Biochar application is attracting attention to be an effective soil organic carbon (SOC) management to prevent land degradation, though quantitative information of its effect on carbon dioxide (CO2) flux and associated microbial responses is still scarce, especially in degraded tropical agroecosystems. We conducted a 27-month field experiment with periodically measuring environmental factors, CO2 efflux rate, microbial biomass C (MBC), and SOC stock, and evaluated the impact of land management (control (C), biochar (B; 8.2 Mg C ha(-1)), farmyard manure (FYM) (M; 1.1 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)), and a mixture of both (BM) on CO2 flux, microbial responses (MBC and qCO(2) as microbial activity) and C budget, in tropical alkaline cropland of southern India. Based on the relationship between the CO2 efflux rate and environmental factors, cumulative CO2 flux was estimated at 2.4, 2.7, 4.0, and 3.7 Mg C ha(-1) in the C, B, M, and BM treatments, respectively. Biochar application increased soil moisture though did not affect CO2 flux, causing a positive C budget (6.7 Mg C ha(-1)), because of the limited response of microbes to increased soil moisture due to the small amount of SOC. Biochar and FYM combined application did not increase CO2 flux compared with FYM alone, contributing to the largest SOC increment (8.9 Mg C ha(-1)) with a positive C budget (9.1 Mg C ha(-1)), due to little difference of microbial responses between the two treatments. Hence, biochar application combined with FYM could be an effective SOC management in the degraded cropland of southern India.",1
"Flexible options are expected to be adopted in climate change mitigation strategies due to the high uncertainty of climate change. Real options analysis (ROA) matches the feature of filling flexibility under climate change but is seldom leveraged in the decision-making of strategy investment at the building scale. This study proposes a ROAbased decision-making framework to bridge this research gap. First, the future energy consumption is simulated, and the expected yearly future energy loss caused by climate change is calculated. Then, individual and sequential investment analyses are made based on ROA and three strategies (i.e., shading, photovoltaic panels, and shading + photovoltaic panels). Finally, a sensitivity analysis for optimal investment time, investment sequence, etc., is performed, and regression analysis is used to prove and extend the sensitivity analysis results. The results show that climate change uncertainty does not alter the optimal individual and sequential investment strategies. However, increasing the discount rate advances the optimal investment time and shows an exponential relationship with the premium. The enhancement of forcing has a marginal effect on project return and it advances the optimal investment year for individual investment. Additionally, the forcing positively correlates with the benefit of deferring the option under shared socioeconomic pathways SSP1-2.6 and SSP2-4.5 but it negatively correlates with the benefit of deferring the option under SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5. The unit dry bulb temperature under certain forcing yields a range of benefits from 0.47 x 106 to 0.90 x 106 USD when deferring the option. This proposed decision-making framework guides the development of mitigation strategies and provides more managerial flexibility for investors.",1
"Reducing red meat consumption in high-consuming countries is critical for mitigating climate change and preventing chronic disease. This study tested the effectiveness of messages conveying the worsening or reduction of environmental harms at discouraging red meat consumption. 1078 U.S. adults viewed seven messages in an online survey highlighting the reduction or worsening of environmental harms associated with eating red meat (between-subjects factor) and rated the messages on how much they discouraged them from wanting to buy beef. Each message highlighted a different environmental harm: deforestation, climate change, water shortages, biodiversity loss, carbon footprint, greenhouse gas emissions, or environment (within-subjects factor). No statistically significant difference was found between the reduction and worsening of environmental harms conditions for most topics, though the worsening of harms frame slightly outperformed the reduction of harms frame for the 'environment' topic. 'Environment' was also the message topic that elicited the strongest response from participants overall. Latino participants, those with more than a high school degree, and those who consume beef once a week or less rated messages as more effective than non-Latino participants, those who completed high school or less, and those who consumed beef more than once a week. Future research should explore the effect of messages on behavioral outcomes.",1
"Emissions from a Direct Injection (DI) diesel engine can be reduced by the addition of metallic fuel-borne additives. However, the effect of fuel-borne catalysts in a dual fuel engine with hydrogen (H-2) as a secondary fuel is not well known. Hence, experimentation was carried out to investigate the effects of nano-metallic oxide fuel additives on the major physicochemical properties and performance of jatropha biodiesel blends in a DI diesel engine in dual fuel mode. Jatropha methyl ester WE) biodiesel is produced from degummed crude jatropha oil after reducing the free fatty acid (FFA) content to less than 2% and performing transesterification using a 20 kHz frequency ultrasonicator with a sodium hydroxide (NaOH) catalyst Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles at 100 ppm with a size of 20 and 40 nm were suspended in primary fuel of JME biodiesel. H-2 as a secondary fuel with flowrates of 0.5 and 1.5 L/min was maintained during the experiments. The experimental results reveal that the nanoparticle size influences the engine performance and emissions. The presence of nanoparticles in the fuel blends reduced the nitrogen oxide (NO.) emissions. However, the effects of the size and concentration were marginal with an increasing H-2 flowrate. With an increasing H-2 flow rate, hydrocarbon (HC) emissions decreased for nanoparticles of size 20 nm, but increased for 40 nm. Smoke opacity was increased compared with pure biodiesel owing to the presence of surfactant Triton-X100. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",1
"Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) is a necessary complement to emissions reductions to achieve a state of global net zero emissions and stabilise future warming. Despite its utility, CDR remains poorly understood. Due to a range of constraints, CDR is a fundamentally finite resource, which we currently do not have enough of to achieve and go beyond global net zero. This has wide-ranging but underexplored implications for the technical and economic feasibility of our collective net zero transition. At the same time, both the opportunity and obligation to undertake CDR are not equally distributed amongst actors and geographies. As a result, there are ongoing questions as to how we can increase the supply of quality CDR whilst at the same time ensure equitable distribution of that same CDR, both within and between countries and non-state actors. To explore these phenomena, we introduce and define the concept of a Carbon Removal Budget (CRB), illustrate how it can apply to different contexts and scales, and distinguish it from the related but distinct concept of the carbon budget. We further estimate the global CRB, review its constraints and quality considerations and outline potential utilisation pathways and principles. We then examine the potential application of the CRB as a tool on which both public and private decision-makers can use to assess the feasibility of their nationally determined contributions and/or net-zero transition plans. In this manner, we illustrate how CRB forecasts can be used today to help build the net zero future of tomorrow.",1
"The value of climate change mitigation largely depends on the social discount rate, which has almost exclusively been influenced by economists. A survey of expert philosophers shows that, as a group, they support the same social discount rate as economists, resulting in the same mitigation policy, but for different ethical and practical reasons.",1
"The potential of large-scale industrial CO(2) injection as an interim solution will vastly depend on our ability to quantify its uncertainties and risks. Current numerical simulation models are inadequate for stochastic simulation techniques, because they are too expensive for repeated simulation. Even single deterministic simulations may require parallel high-performance computing. Because the involved multiphase flow processes of CO(2) in porous media have a significantly nonlinear character, the problem is too non-linear for quasi-linear and other simplified stochastic tools. As an alternative approach, we propose a massive stochastic model reduction which is based on the probabilistic collocation method. The model response surface is projected onto a orthogonal basis of higher-order polynomials, allowing for nonlinear propagation of model uncertainties onto, e. g., the predicted risk of CO(2) leakage back to the surface. The variable parameters include uncertain model parameters, such as porosity, permeability, etc., and a list of design parameters (injection rate, depth, etc.). The chosen degree of the polynomial balances between computational effort and accuracy. The proposed stochastic approach was validated through Monte Carlo simulation using a common 3D Benchmark(2). The reasonable compromise between computational efforts and precision was reached with 2nd order polynomials. In this case study, our proposed approach yields a computational speed-up of 100: 1000 Benchmark runs for Monte Carlo evaluation are comparable to 10 Benchmark runs using the probabilistic collocation method. At the same time, our collocation methodology is an integrative powerful tool for optimizing design variables under uncertainty in one approach (via integrative response surfaces). This leads to robust designs with minimum failure probability over the entire range of uncertainty.",1
"Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies are often highlighted as a crucial component of future low carbon energy systems in the UK and internationally. Whilst these technologies are now in the demonstration phase world-wide, they are still characterised by a range of technical, economic, policy, social and legal uncertainties. This paper applies a framework for the analysis of these uncertainties that was previously developed by the authors to a historical evidence base. This evidence base comprises nine case studies, each of which focuses on a technology that is partly analogous to CCS. The paper's analysis of these case studies examines the conditions under which the uncertainties concerned have been at least partly resolved, and what lessons can be drawn for CCS. The paper then uses the case study evidence to discuss linkages between the uncertainties in the analysis framework, and how these linkages differ from those that were originally expected. Finally, the paper draws conclusions for the methodological approach that has been used and for strategies to develop and deploy CCS technologies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",1
"This work provides a review of economic, technical, sociocultural, political, and technological barriers that impede carbon neutrality in the building sector of countries in the Global South. These barriers include limitations in public and professional awareness, knowledge, and skills in the construction industry, the lack of ambitious energy codes and green building rating systems, the lack of green financing schemes and investment, costs of materials and technology, and limitations in regulations. Finally, this article recommends five transformations to address the critical barriers and enable net-zero emission status in the building sector of countries in the Global South. These transformations include environmental data collection, stringent building energy codes, and green building system certifications, lifecycle-based thinking and circular design, education enhancement and workforce development, and net-zero emission business practices.",1
"Renewable systems for heating and cooling (RES-HC) systems in last ten years have gradually increased their importance and their presence in the global heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) market. Many energetic analysis and impact assessments have been made, which have demonstrated the convenience, respect to traditional HVAC systems, of solutions such as solar thermal or low enthalpy geothermal systems in terms of: energy consumption reduction, renewable energy use increase and emissions decrease. However, the several analysis made, up to date, only have considered the operation period of such systems, and consequently the comparison has been made only in terms of energy vectors used, omitting materials, components and processes. This paper aims to give a new perspective, showing how a correct environmental analysis should take into account all the life cycle of a system, from the cradle to grave, also if the system concerns a renewable energy source. In the specific case, a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) will be presented, focusing on two currently popular RES-HC systems: solar thermal and low enthalpy geothermal, compared to the same functional unit. The results of this analysis could be a good starting point for future work on impact assessment of more complex and integrated HVAC systems. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

"The cost of energy represents, by far, the largest fraction of total operational expenditures that datacenter operators ought to face. For this very reason, several studies have focused on evaluating how such energy costs can be reduced and on quantifying that reduction; using green energy sources (e.g. solar) that can be generated by installing infrastructures nearby datacenters is clearly an interesting option. Assuming that green energy is available, workloads consolidation in those datacenters with the highest amount of self-generated energy allows reducing remarkably the consumption of brown energy. Workload management is of paramount importance to increase green energy consumption in the context of distributed datacenters. In that scenario, a centralized and orchestrated operation leads to large energy cost savings. To this end, we firstly present a model to estimate the amount of green energy produced in each location as a function of the specific time period and the expected weather conditions. Next, the problem of minimizing energy costs by properly placing workloads in federated datacenters under uncertainty in the availability of green energy in each location is faced using stochastic programming techniques. Illustrative numerical results validate the usefulness of the proposed stochastic approach.",1
"The development of carbon-neutral fuel sources is an essential step in addressing the global fossil energy crisis. Whole-cell biophotovoltaic systems (BPVs) are a renewable, non-polluting energy-generating device that utilizes oxygenic photosynthetic microbes (OPMs) to split water molecules and generate bioelectricity under the driving of light energy. Since 2006, BPVs have been widely studied, with the order magnitudes of power density increasing from 10-4 mW/m2 to 103 mW/m2. This review examines the extracellular electron transfer (EET) mechanisms and regulation techniques of BPVs from biofilm to external environment. It is found that the EET of OPMs is mainly mediated by membrane proteins, with terminal oxidase limiting the power output. Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 and Chlorella vulgaris are two species that produce high power density in BPVs. The use of metal nanoparticles mixing, 3D pillar array electrodes, microfluidic technology, and transient-state operation models can significantly enhance power density. Challenges and potential research directions are discussed, including a deeper analysis of EET mechanisms and dynamics, the development of modular devices, integration of multiple regulatory components, and the exploration of novel BPV technologies.",1
"Methane is an important greenhouse gas due to its high warming potential. While quantifying anthropogenic methane emissions is important for evaluation measures applied for climate change mitigation, large emission uncertainties still exist for many source categories. To evaluate anthropogenic methane emission inventory in various regions over the globe, we extract emission signatures from column-average methane observations (XCH4) by GOSAT (Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite) satellite using high-resolution atmospheric transport model simulations. XCH4 abundance due to anthropogenic emissions is estimated as the difference between polluted observations from surrounding cleaner observations. Here, reduction of observation error, which is large compared to local abundance, is achieved by binning the observations over large region according to model-simulated enhancements. We found that the local enhancements observed by GOSAT scale linearly with inventory based simulations of XCH4 for the globe, East Asia and North America. Weighted linear regression of observation derived and inventory-based XCH4 anomalies was carried out to find a scale factor by which the inventory agrees with the observations. Over East Asia, the observed enhancements are 30% lower than suggested by emission inventory, implying a potential overestimation in the inventory. On the contrary, in North America, the observations are approximately 28% higher than model predictions, indicating an underestimation in emission inventory. Our results concur with several recent studies using other analysis methodologies, and thus confirm that satellite observations provide an additional tool for bottom-up emission inventory verification.",1
"Traditional offshore microgrids such as drilling rigs and oil and gas platforms rely on diesel generators to provide their electricity needs. With the recent developments in offshore wind, solar and wave generation, and the maturity growth of the energy storage technology, the offshore microgrids are transitioning away from diesel generation. When the majority of the energy sources and loads is DC-native or rely on conversion to DC, setting up the network as a DC microgrid becomes a viable option. Using DC coupling in offshore microgrids eliminates the problems of harmonic distortion, low inertia and overcomplicated control. However, with the high penetration of intermittent generation, the provision of DC microgrid stability becomes a challenging task. This is particularly acute within practical DC microgrids since, at this stage, there are not many off-the-shelf DC components. This paper describes the experimental lab facilities set up for offshore DC microgrid research and investigates the stability issues presented in the renewable energy-based DC microgrid.",1
"Stable power plant operation is the only way to ensure daily production of electricity. However, this operation is highly prone to breakdowns that often lead to a power outage known as a power failure. Another disadvantage of this operation is its significant contribution to environmental pollution in its consumption of fossil fuels. To avoid these problems, this study investigates ways to integrate renewable energy sources (RESs) to a combined-cycle power plant in the Philippines through matrix laboratory (MATLAB) simscape simulations. Results show that MATLAB simulations obtain a 90% level of acceptance in terms of power, voltage, and current outputs generated from the wind solar farm system simscape model with the use of data in the Philippine setting. These observations prove that the more RESs are combined and incorporated in a simscape model, the more energy set to replace power loss during a power outage will be harnessed.",1
"Metal-air batteries (MABs) offer a promising solution to address the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources and facilitate the global transition to green energy, thereby mitigating climate issues. However, efficient and affordable bifunctional electrocatalysts are essential to overcome the kinetic limitations of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in MABs, ensuring optimal performance and accessibility of these devices. This study reports a template-assisted mechanosynthesis of a bifunctional FeNi-N-C electrocatalyst by employing low-cost and sustainable FeCl3, NiCl2, 2,4,6-tri(2-pyridyl)-1,3,5-triazine (TPTZ), melamine and KCl. Facile liquid-assisted grinding was utilized to produce KCl-templated FeNi-TPTZ metal-organic material, enabling template-induced stability of the catalyst. A carefully tailored pyrolysis strategy allows near-melt preheating of FeNi-TPTZ, increasing the concentration of active sites. Furthermore, the pyrolysis protocol enables the phase transition of KCl, functionalizing it as a solid-liquid template to achieve a high porosity (S-BET = 570 m(2) g(-1)). The produced catalyst - IroNi-3D exhibits impressive ORR (E-1/2 = 0.82 V, E-onset = 0.92 V) and OER (E-j=10 = 1.52 V) performance with a Delta E of 0.70 V. In zinc-air battery testing, IroNi-3D outperforms PtRu with a power density of 144 mW cm(-2). This cost-effective FeNi-N-C electrocatalyst presents great promise for widespread use in MABs, advancing renewable energy storage and contributing to global climate change mitigation.",1
"In projects regarding renewable energy facilities, decision making is an essential activity that provides greater consistency and viability to the project. The first step that any promoter of such facilities should face is to select an optimal location. To do so, it is necessary to consider all the criteria that influence the decision. However, not all the criteria are equally important, which means that determining their weights is extremely important. The objective of this chapter is to obtain the weights of the decision criteria that influence the location problems of wind farms and solar photovoltaic and thermoelectric plants. For this, a Decision Support System (DSS) has been designed that allows to carry out the extraction of knowledge from an expert group by Fuzzy AHP methodology. Finally, DSS will sort the viable locations based on the importance of the criteria that influence the decision.",1
"The substitution of energy based on fossil fuel by bioenergy could be an effective solution to reduce external energy dependency, thereby promoting sustainable development. This article details a study of the use of biomass residues produced in the forestry sector as a consequence of field operations of the two predominant forest species (Pinus radiata D. Don and Ecualyptus globulus Labill) of Biscay (Spain). The potential of forest residues is estimated to be 66,600 dry Mg year 1. These residues would provide 1307 TJ year 1. Energy parameters, ultimate and proximate analyses, and the level of emissions of the forest residues are performed in order to estimate their characteristics as fuel. The research done has shown very similar values in terms of the net calorific value of the residues of P. radiata (19.45 MJ kg 1) and E. globulus (19.48 MJ kg 1). The determined emission factors indicate a reduction in gas emissions: CO (23-25%), CO2 (22-25%), SO2 (87-91%) and dust (11-38%) and an increase of 11-37% in NOx compared to hard coal. Estimation of the emission factors of the residual biomass allows the environmental impacts, that are potentially produced by biofuel, to be estimated.",1
"The use of forest biomass as a renewable energy source has received much attention as a response to climate change and the increasing global demands for energy. Local availability and conversion into secondary energy carriers with a lower capital investment shows more weights on its interests. The substitution of fossil fuel by biomass fuel can have a strong effect on the mitigation of climate change through reducing greenhouse gases, which can be an important consideration for CDM projects in Bangladesh. This study uses literature review to analyse the legal framework of carbon trading under CDM, CDM additionality, CDM and bioenergy promotion, land availability and technology for biomass production, and sustainability of CDM projects in Bangladesh. The barriers to CDM projects in Bangladesh are explained as well as measures for promoting biomass production. Biomass and bioenergy-based CDM projects can be attractive and support sustainable development in Bangladesh. The study suggests capacity building and policy changes needed in order to comply with CDM modalities. The study can be useful to the climate change mitigation and development policy makers in Bangladesh.",1
"This paper provides a high-accuracy assessment of domestic demand-side management (DSM) approach in the context of distributed renewable energy sources (RES). To determine the potential of domestic DSM for households, a microgrid model of a typical UK residential estate was developed to simulate the impact of RES. The microgrid model comprises 15 UK households with appropriate allocation of washing machines, tumble dryers and dishwashers in accordance with the statistical data. In order to obtain a high-accuracy result, the power consumption of the microgrid model utilises real historical high-resolution data of household energy consumption and RES generation. Thereafter, 40% of distributed wind and solar energy is implemented in the model to produce two individual scenarios. The operation of the white appliances in the model is controlled using a domestic DSM based on a load shifting algorithm. The primary criterion of the DSM considered in this paper is the reduction in energy feedback to the grid in order to decrease the utilisation of the grid and to reduce the transmission losses. The results obtained from the model simulation are compared to the baseline model and discussed with respect to the possible benefits of implementation of domestic DSM under the impact of RES. It has been shown that the self-consumption ratio of the microgrid operating under the DSM is increased by 3% for both scenarios. The model analysis provides highly realistic results which can be used for efficiency assessment of various load shifting methods.",1
"In the current work the feasibility of integration of High Temperature Superconducting (HTS) cables into distribution networks with the existence of high penetration of renewable energy based distributed resources is investigated. Different scenarios regarding the integration of HTS cables into a typical rural MV distribution network have been analyzed. The analyses were performed in different time horizons such as today, 2030, and 2050. The HV cables, HV overhead lines, and MV conventional cables are compared with the MV-HTS cables regarding technical and economical issues. The results show that as a large amount of renewable energy based DG power is intended to be interconnected into the distribution networks, more benefits can be gained using the HTS cables.

"Subsurface injection of carbon dioxide (CO2) is a technique to enhance oil recovery and so the economic value of depleting fields. It complements carbon capture and storage, which is a key technology to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. In this work, an integrated method developed by the British Geological Survey and Cardiff University uses high-resolution 3D seismic and borehole data from the Jaren High to analyse potential seal breaches and fluid flow paths in a frontier area of the North Sea, ultimately assessing the risk of a possible carbon capture and storage site. We integrate the spatial analysis of subsurface fluid flow features with borehole and geochemical data to model the burial and thermal history of potential storage sites, estimating the timing of fluid expulsion. On seismic data, fluid pipes connect reservoir intervals of different ages. Spatial analysis reveals clustering of fluid flow features above strata grounded onto deep reservoirs intervals. Our integrated method shows that gas matured from Dinantian coal and migrated up-dip during the Triassic-Jurassic into the lower sandstone reservoir of the Rotliegend Group. The containing seal rock was breached once sufficiently large volumes of gas generated high overpressures in the reservoir. Some of these fluid flow features may still be active conduits, as indicated by bright amplitude anomalies within the pipes. This study shows how integrated analyses may enhance our understanding of fluid-flow pathways, de-risking prospective sites for carbon capture and storage. The method proposed in this work is particularly important to assess the suitability of area with trapped gas pockets and understand tertiary migration in areas proposed for geological storage of CO2.",1
"Green power conversion is the shift away from traditional fuels towards clean energy sources such as nuclear power plants, hydroelectric dams, wind farms, and solar panels. This research examines the impact of clean energy demand and green financing on reducing carbon emissions in 29 economies in Europe and Asia from 2007 to 2020. The study used a two-step differenced GMM estimator for the available data set spanning 2007 to 2020. The study found that rising demand for nuclear power helps to achieve a carbon-neutral agenda, but insufficient funding for renewable energy leads to higher carbon emissions. The research suggests increasing investment in nuclear energy and green financing can improve regional environmental quality. The study found a causal link between fuel imports, nuclear power and regional growth. It also determined that fuel imports, chemical use, green financing and the need for nuclear energy will likely impact regional environmental quality. The research recommends allocating more resources toward innovation to boost energy efficiency and expanding investment in renewable and nuclear energy production industries via green finance. The study also highlights the need to encourage the development of renewable energy sources to cut carbon emissions and establish a sustainable society.

"Solar-powered irrigation system, a low-cost option, ensures varieties of co-benefits both in the domains of climate mitigation and adaptation, and thus has been incorporated as a part of climate project. However, its co-benefits in climate adaptation have not been sufficiently explored, which may result in a lack of insights about co-benefits and prevent wider roll-out and scaling-up. This paper aims at exploring co-benefits of solar-powered irrigation, an adaptation measure, taking a project in a drought-prone area of the northwest part of Bangladesh as a case. Using both interviews and focused group discussion, this research finds that besides generating co-benefits in climate mitigation, there are substantial adaptation co-benefits in various forms including vulnerability reduction and enhancement of resilience. However, many of the co-benefits in climate adaptation are indirect and less visible and realizable in the long-term, such as informal social group formation, improved financial strength, and employment opportunity. Making co-benefits more visible among various stakeholders, and launching a feed-in option may help to scale up solar-powered irrigation. (C)Y 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",1
"Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) installations are used for storing electrical power, under the form of potential energy from compressed air. The heat generated during compression can be stored to improve the efficiency of compression-expansion cycle. The solution presented consists of a 100 kW screw compressor driven by a 110 kW asynchronous three-phase motor. The compressor supplies air into vessels which store it until a high electrical energy demand arises. At that time, the compressed air is released into a 132 kW screw expander whose shaft spins a 132 kW asynchronous generator, producing electric power and supplying it into the electrical grid. Before expansion, the air must be preheated in order to avoid the freezing of expansion equipment. If the heat generated during compression is used for air preheating before expansion, the process is adiabatic. A demonstrative model of the installation is currently being developed, with the expander part being completed so far. The maximum power to be produced was calculated to be around 100 kW. During expander commissioning tests with air supply from a 250 kW high pressure compressor, a maximum generated power of 49.7 kW was attained, expected to be higher when releasing air from the reservoirs.",1
"Marine vegetated habitats (seagrasses, salt-marshes, macroalgae and mangroves) occupy 0.2% of the ocean surface, but contribute 50% of carbon burial in marine sediments. Their canopies dissipate wave energy and high burial rates raise the seafloor, buffering the impacts of rising sea level and wave action that are associated with climate change. The loss of a third of the global cover of these ecosystems involves a loss of CO2 sinks and the emission of 1 Pg CO2 annually. The conservation, restoration and use of vegetated coastal habitats in eco-engineering solutions for coastal protection provide a promising strategy, delivering significant capacity for climate change mitigation and adaption.",1
"Historical increases in agricultural production were achieved predominantly by large increases in agricultural productivity. Intensification of crop and livestock production also plays a key role in future projections of agricultural land use. Here, we assess and discuss projections of crop yields by global agricultural land-use and integrated assessment models. To evaluate these crop yield projections, we compare them to empirical data on attainable yields by employing a linear and plateauing continuation of observed attainable yield trends. While keeping in mind the uncertainties of attainable yields projections and not considering future climate change impacts, we find that, on average for all cereals on the global level, global projected yields by 2050 remain below the attainable yields. This is also true for future pathways with high technological progress and mitigation efforts, indicating that projected yield increases are not overly optimistic, even under systemic transformations. On a regional scale, we find that for developing regions, specifically for sub-Saharan Africa, projected yields stay well below attainable yields, indicating that the large yield gaps which could be closed through improved crop management, may also persist in the future. In OECD countries, in contrast, current yields are already close to attainable yields, and the projections approach or, for some models, even exceed attainable yields by 2050. This observation parallels research suggesting that future progress in attainable yields in developed regions will mainly have to be achieved through new crop varieties or genetic improvements. The models included in this study vary widely in their implementation of yield progress, which are often split into endogenous (crop management) improvements and exogenous (technological) trends. More detail and transparency are needed in these important elements of global yields and land use projections, and this paper discusses possibilities of better aligning agronomic understanding of yield gaps and yield potentials with modelling approaches.",1
"Multi-energy supply is general need for the industrial parks due to the various production processes of different enterprises, and its main characteristics are high energy consumption and high carbon emissions. The carbon emission reduction of high energy consuming industrial parks is the key link for China to achieve double carbon goal. Therefore, this paper presents an emission reduction strategy of energy internet for high energy consuming industrial parks, taking an energy internet system of a typical high energy consuming industrial park in Chongqing as an example. The energy supply and carbon emission characteristics, as well as the energy consumption characteristics and carbon emission characteristics are firstly analyzed for the main production enterprises in the industrial parks. A multi-energy interactive coupling emission reduction strategy is presented to meet the multi type energy demand of the industrial parks and promotes energy conservation and emission reduction of industrial enterprises, which really breaks through the traditional isolated energy emission reduction. Finally, the results show that the emission reduction strategy can effectively reduce the carbon emission of energy internet in high energy consuming industrial parks.",1
"This paper focuses on comparing the frameworks and projections from four global transportation models with considerable technology details. We analyze and compare the modeling frameworks, underlying data, assumptions, intermediate parameters, and projections to identify the sources of divergence or consistency, as well as key knowledge gaps. We find that there are significant differences in the base-year data and key parameters for future projections, especially for developing countries. These include passenger and freight activity, mode shares, vehicle ownership rates, and energy consumption by mode, particularly for shipping, aviation and trucking. This may be due in part to a lack of previous efforts to do such consistency-checking and bench-marking. We find that the four models differ in terms of the relative roles of various mitigation strategies to achieve a 2 degrees C/450 ppm target: the economics-based integrated assessment models favor the use of low carbon fuels as the primary mitigation option followed by efficiency improvements, whereas transport-only and expert-based models favor efficiency improvements of vehicles followed by mode shifts. We offer recommendations for future modeling improvements focusing on (1) reducing data gaps; (2) translating the findings from this study into relevant policy implications such as gaps of current policy goals, additional policy targets needed, regional vs. global reductions; (3) modeling strata of demographic groups to improve understanding of vehicle ownership levels, travel behavior, and urban vs. rural considerations; and (4) conducting coordinated efforts in aligning historical data, and comparing input assumptions and results of policy analysis and modeling insights.

"Small-scale autonomous renewable energy systems have gained attention during the last years due to growing concerns in relation to an increasing world energy demand and to constraints in CO2 emissions. Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFC), wind turbines and solar panels are promising zero-emission devices to be incorporated into these systems. In order to integrate them, appropriate control designs are necessary, among other aspects. This paper presents a configuration that allows a proper operation of the fuel cell while the system is able to handle the power fluctuations produced by the wind turbine and the load. An electrolyzer is used to take advantage of the power surplus. The system is designed to supply 10 households, but can be easily extended. The objective of this study is to evaluate the technical feasibility of implementing such a power balancing set-up in DENLab, a renewable energy laboratory at Delft University of Technology, the Netherlands.",1
"This study aims to evaluate and compare two integrated processes (Plant A and B) for hydrocarbon production from CO2. They involve proton exchange membrane water electrolysis for H2 production, reverse water-gas shift reaction for syngas production, pressure swing adsorption for syngas purification, Fischer-Tropsch synthesis for diesel-range hydrocarbons from CO2, and atmospheric distillation for product separation. Plant B additionally integrates a hydrocracking-based upgrading section. The simulations were performed using Aspen Plus (R) v10, Aspen Adsorption (R) v10, and Aspen Custom Modeler (R) v10. The evaluation covers technical, economic, environmental, and multi-criteria assessment (GREENSCOPE). The proposed processes demonstrate the potential to convert CO2 to hydrocarbons, with carbon conversion rates of 75% and 71% for Plants A and B, respectively. Process energy intensity is 155 and 170 MJ/kgLP for Plants A and B, respectively. Environmental assessment reveals CO2 reduction, resulting in negative global warming potentials of -2.20 and -0.84 kgCO2-eq/kgLP for Plants A and B, respectively. The sustainability degree indices for Plants A and B are 1.00 and 0.06, respectively, indicating Plant A as the more sustainable process alternative based on both quantitative and qualitative metrics. Economic analysis shows project unviability in the Brazilian context due to reliance on H2 production and prevailing pricing conditions. Economic viability requires a price increase of liquid products by 266% and 302% or CO2-eq abatement costs ranging from 2.05 to 3.43 US$/kgCO2-eq for Plants A and B, respectively. GREENSCOPE methodology indicates better performance for Plant A across all scores, highlighting a clear connection between the hydrocracking unit and performance indicators. The findings show that these processes align with sustainable development goals (SDGs) targets for climate action (SDG 13), clean energy (SDG 7), industry, innovation, and infrastructure (SDG 9), decent work and economic growth (SDG 8), and responsible consumption and production (SDG 12). Overall, the research moves forward SDGs by offering solutions to cut carbon emissions and promote sustainable industrial practices.",1
"In order to realize the goals of sustainable energy use and low-carbon economic development, this paper analyzes the operating characteristics of cogeneration units, carbon capture and electricity-to-gas conversion equipment, proposes a combined operation mode of cogeneration units taking into account carbon capture and electricity-to-gas conversion technologies, analyzes the characteristics of the electricity-heat output of the cogeneration units and the carbon emissions under the mode, and establishes an integrated energy microgrid economic operation model under the joint operation mode taking into account the carbon trading. An economic operation model is developed for the integrated energy microgrid considering carbon trading under this combined operation mode. The example verifies the economy and carbon emission advantages of the integrated energy microgrid based on carbon capture and electricity-to-gas conversion technologies under four scenarios, which effectively reduces the carbon emission of the microgrid while minimizing the system operation cost. Compared with the traditional microgrid, the operating cost is reduced by 7776.84 yuan and the carbon emission is reduced by 2697.88 kg.",1
"Currently in the US, over 97% of food waste is estimated to be buried in landfills. There is nonetheless interest in strategies to divert this waste from landfills as evidenced by a number of programs and policies at the local and state levels, including collection programs for source separated organic wastes (SSO). The objective of this study was to characterize the state-of-the-practice of food waste treatment alternatives in the US and Canada. Site visits were conducted to aerobic composting and two anaerobic digestion facilities, in addition to meetings with officials that are responsible for program implementation and financing. The technology to produce useful products from either aerobic or anaerobic treatment of SSO is in place. However, there are a number of implementation issues that must be addressed, principally project economics and feedstock purity. Project economics varied by region based on landfill disposal fees. Feedstock purity can be obtained by enforcement of contaminant standards and/or manual or mechanical sorting of the feedstock prior to and after treatment. Future SSO diversion will be governed by economics and policy incentives, including landfill organics bans and climate change mitigation policies. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",1
"This article presents an overview of the current state of the art in the structure determination of microporous carbon-capture materials, as discussed at the recent NIST workshop Integrating Crystallographic and Computational Approaches to Carbon-Capture Materials for the Mitigation of Climate Change. The continual rise in anthropogenic CO2 concentration and its effect on climate change call for the implementation of carbon capture technologies to reduce the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. Porous solids, including metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), are feasible candidates for gas capture and storage applications. However, determining the structure of these materials represents a significant obstacle in their development into advanced sorbents. The existing difficulties can be overcome by integrating crystallographic methods and theoretical modeling. The workshop gathered experimentalists and theorists from academia, government, and industry to review this field and identify approaches, including collaborative opportunities, required to develop tools for rapid determination of the structures of porous solid sorbents and the effect of structure on the carbon capture performance. We highlight the findings of that workshop, especially in the need for reference materials, standardized procedures and reporting of sorbent activation and adsorption measurements, standardized reporting of theoretical calculations, and round-robin structure determination. This article presents a perspective on the state of the art in the structure determination of microporous carbon-capture materials and paths toward future progress in this field, as discussed the NIST workshop of the same title.",1
"In light of pollinator decline, plant species suitable for the restoration and conservation of pollinators need to be selected. In this systemic review, we concentrated on the importance of NFWV (non-forest woody vegetation, i.e., linear or grouped trees/shrubs) for pollinators across agricultural landscapes. In the temperate climate zone, flowering trees and shrubs provide nectar sugar (energy) and pollen (nutrients) for managed and wild pollinators. They also create nesting niches and serve as host plants that support the full life cycle of wild pollinators. The creation of woodland strips/groups is a cost-effective and time-saving strategy to improve self-repeatable nectar and pollen resources on a landscape scale. The spatial distribution of NFWV can help to create an entire network of pollinator-friendly habitats. NFWV can support the continuity of food resources outside of the crop flowering season, i.e., during seasonal bottlenecks. This concept also offers other environmental benefits (e.g., water and air quality improvement, climate mitigation). However, future work should address the usefulness of trees/shrubs for different crops and regions to develop a network of flower-rich corridors. Likewise, more advanced and detailed studies are necessary to determine the qualitative characteristics of nectar and pollen, which may result in optimization of pollinator nutrition.",1
"Human overexploitation of natural resources and frequent extreme climate events poses significant challenges to societal sustainability. Scholars have extensively assessed Inner Mongolia's grasslands, agricultural-pastoral transition zones, and overall ecological conditions, but little evaluation of landscape ecological risk exists. Utilizing land use/land cover data, we calculated landscape fragmentation, fragility, and loss indices to construct a landscape ecological risk model. This model revealed the spatiotemporal characteristics of landscape ecological risks in Inner Mongolia. Multiple linear regression and Geodetector models quantified the relative importance of topography, climate, and human activities on spatiotemporal changes in landscape ecological risk. The findings indicated a declining trend in landscape ecological risk in Inner Mongolia over the past 30 years, with high-risk areas predominantly in the west and low-risk areas mainly in the northeast. Ecologically sensitive areas are located in the Yellow River Basin and in agricultural-pastoral transition zones. The dependence of ecological risk improvement on land use/land cover change shows a decreasing trend. Climate (90.38%) and human activity (8.84%) primarily drove the annual ecological risk variation in Inner Mongolia. Climate (45%) and human activities (similar to 30%) jointly propelled spatial changes in ecological risks. This study recommends managing land use/land cover change, protecting sensitive areas, and enhancing ecological monitoring in Inner Mongolia.",1
"Various smart grid technologies can help achieve a region's environmental and climate mitigation goals by facilitating the deployment of renewable energy sources, transportation electrification, energy conservation and load-shifting of electricity use. This study reviews and explores the role of environmental framing in the socio-political acceptance of smart grid technologies by citizens, media, and key stakeholders, using the case study of British Columbia, Canada-a low carbon electricity-based region where smart grid deployment has been mandated as part of climate change legislation. We collected and analyzed data from British Columbia via a survey of Canadian citizens implemented in 2013 (n = 2930), a media analysis of newspaper articles from 2007 to 2012, and interviews with key stakeholders in 2013. We find that overall citizen acceptance of one smart grid technology (smart meters) is relatively low in British Columbia, but acceptance doubles when the survey explicitly describes smart meters according to positive frames, namely environmental benefits without installation costs or mandatory enrolment. In contrast, we find that media and key stakeholders in British Columbia focus more on economic frames of smart grid deployment (e.g. reducing electricity costs) than environmental frames (e.g. climate abatement). Further, we find that news media mention smart grid risks 50% more frequently than benefits. By comparing these different aspects of socio-political acceptance, we suggest that key stakeholders seeking to deploy smart grid technology could better stimulate citizen support in certain jurisdictions by more actively using positive, pro-environmental frames and by better engaging with citizens earlier in the technology and policy design and deployment process.",1
"This study focuses on the design of a dual active low-frequency ripple control for a clean-energy power conditioning mechanism with an aim to achieve both the alleviation of the low-frequency current ripple of clean-energy sources, and the improvement of the ac power quality of a power conditioner. First, a simplified circuit for representing both the current ripple phenomena at the high-voltage bus and the polluted ac output terminal inside a general power conditioner including a dc/dc converter and a dc/ac inverter is derived, and the dynamic model of a dual active low-frequency ripple control circuit (DALFRCC) is analyzed. Moreover, two adaptive linear neural networks are taken as neural filters to generate the compensation current commands, and an adaptive total sliding-mode controller (ATSMC) is designed to manipulate the ripple control circuit for injecting respective suitable compensation currents into the high-voltage bus and the output terminal of the conditioner. In addition, the effectiveness of the proposed dual adaptive active low-frequency ripple control scheme has verified by numerical simulations.",0
"Energy and climate policies benefit from modernized construction technology and energy supply source choices. Energy-efficiency improvement and CO2 emission reduction will result from renewable energy (RE) utilization in new and retrofit single-family houses in rural Poland. Several house construction scenarios and heating energy sources comparing building costs and potential emission reduction are based on already existing structures calculated for a 100 m(2) dwelling corresponding to the average rural home. With the addition of thermal insulation and RE-generating equipment, construction costs increase, but the energy costs of operating the home dramatically shrink between a conventional and energy-neutral house. The latter scenario includes thermal solar panels and a heat pump as heating energy sources as well as electricity-generating PV panels. Replacing coal with environmentally-friendly RE reduces CO2 emissions by about 90% annually. Additionally, lower dependence on coal lessens other GHG emissions leading to immediate air quality improvement. New house building regulations guide homeowner construction and heating energy choice, but even larger gains could result from retrofitting existing rural houses, expanding environmental benefits and generating energy bill savings to households. However, the varying climate throughout Poland will require the purchase of energy in winter to assure residents' comfort.",1
"Machine learning (ML) is emerging as a powerful approach that has recently shown potential to affect various frontiers of carbon capture, a key interim technology to assist in the mitigation of climate change. In this perspective, we reveal how ML implementations have improved this process in many aspects, for both absorption-and adsorption-based approaches, ranging from the molecular to process level. We discuss the role of ML in predicting the thermody namic properties of absorbents and in improving the absorption process. For adsorption processes, we discuss the promises of ML techniques for exploring many options to find the most cost-effective process scheme, which involves choosing a solid adsorbent and designing a process configuration We also highlight the advantages of ML and the associated risks, elaborate on the importance of the features needed to train ML models, and identify promising future opportunities for ML in carbon capture processes.",1
"There is no doubt that the world is in the midst of an energy crisis. The volatile political landscape and globally increasing CO2 emissions demand that every country consolidate its resources in search of clean and reliable energy. China is no stranger to this crisis as the country has pledged to be carbon neutral by 2060. Leading the world in CO2 emissions, energy demand, coal consumption, and fossil fuel imports, China's reliance on coal and other polluting energy sources seems to be the backbone of its very society. Moving away from these established practices will take time, investment, and focus. Despite promising to peak carbon emissions in the next 20 years, their emissions and energy use patterns continue to trend upwards. The country is already responsible for a quarter of the world's CO2 emissions, yet it continues to build new coal-based power plants at a greater pace than the combined rest of the world. As the world's leading manufacturer of solar panels and electric vehicles, its development of the renewable energy sector is indeed substantial. However, it must be considered whether this progress will impact the country on a large enough scale to combat their current energy trends. So the question remains: how will China combat its CO2 emissions and take the necessary steps toward clean energy in order to fulfill its ambitious promises? This paper will introduce the physical, social, and economic environment of China and discuss its current uses of energy. Second, it will compare and contrast the energy profiles of China and the United States. Lastly, the paper will discuss the progress of China in recent years and introduce several recommendations for actions that can be taken to combat carbon emissions on its journey toward clean energy and carbon neutrality.",1
"In December 2013, local politicians celebrated with a champagne toast as the municipality of Trondheim received permission from the Ministry of Local Government and Modernisation to develop 110 ha (272 acres) of high quality farmland for housing and business. The primary reason for this decision was the promotion of a more climate-friendly city. The land in question had been singled out as especially important for agriculture in previous planning processes. Based on documents, media texts and interviews, this article utilises situational analysis to scrutinise this puzzling political decision. It emphasises the importance of discourse in local decision making regarding scarce resources. Local interests and global issues are connected and made sense of in what Foucault (1972) called a system of meaning, which allows powerful economic interests and climate change mitigation measures to justify the permanent loss of farmland. As food production is invisible on the local political agenda, the re-implantation of multifunctional urban agriculture in the local food system could be a viable approach to slow further conversion of high quality farmland on the urban fringe.",1
"A decarbonized global energy sector is expected to need cumulative investments in the tens to hundreds of trillions of dollars between now and 2050. Due to its size, the current climate-business environment is therefore prone to corruption risks. Yet such corruption risks are rarely explored within the research community. Much of the extant literature on energy and corruption focuses on fossil fuels, especially oil, coal, and natural gas. However, evidence is emerging that corruption risks also feature in renewable energy markets. This paper asks: Who are the new private actors in selected renewable electricity markets in a sample of countries? How can they be profiled or categorized? To what extent do such actors face corruption risks? How do these actors manage or fail to manage corruption risks? More broadly, which successful collaboration mechanisms can be identified from the literature about how to reduce corruption? To provide an answer, in this paper the literature on renewable energy and corruption are extensively reviewed, with a focus on three particular sectors: hydroelectric dams, solar photovoltaic panels (in both grid-connected and off-grid configurations), and wind energy (including a mix of offshore and onshore designs). The paper then identifies eight distinct corruption risks evident across categories including nepotism, tender rigging, bribery, and tax evasion. The paper then explores particular corruption risks in four national contexts (Mexico, Malaysia, Kenya, and South Africa) before offering a suite of five recommendations and solutions to help address corruption. These solutions include corruption risk mapping, subsidy registers and sunset clauses, transparency initiatives, anti-corruption laws, and shared-ownership models.",1

"As an important adjustable power load, desalination not only contributes to clean energy consumption, but also has a very important strategic value for solving the global water shortage and realizing the sustainable development of coastal desert areas such as the Middle East and North Africa. In this paper, a variety of seawater desalination technologies and respective characteristics were introduced, including distillation, reverse osmosis, electrodialysis, and dual-purpose power and water plant. After that, the load characteristics of energy-consuming equipment for seawater desalination were analyzed. Some integration of seawater desalination technology and clean energy, including solar power desalination and wind power desalination were explained and the economic difference between desalination and the South-to-North Water Diversion Project in China were compared.",1
"In the quest for sustainable energy solutions, predicting electricity prices for renewable energy sources plays a pivotal role in efficient resource allocation and decision making. This article presents a novel approach to forecasting electricity prices for renewable energy sources using deep learning models, leveraging historical data from the power system operator (PSE). The proposed methodology encompasses data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, training, and evaluation. By harnessing the power of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and other advanced deep learning architectures, the model captures intricate temporal relationships, weather patterns, and demand fluctuations that impact renewable energy prices. The study demonstrates the applicability of this approach through empirical analysis, showcasing its potential to enhance energy market predictions and aid in the transition to more sustainable energy systems. The outcomes underscore the importance of accurate renewable energy price predictions in fostering informed decision making and facilitating the integration of renewable sources into the energy landscape. As governments worldwide prioritize renewable energy adoption, this research contributes to the arsenal of tools driving the evolution towards a cleaner and more resilient energy future.",1
"Utilizing renewable energy in buildings helps to reduce consumption of conventional energy and to achieve low carbon economy. The past decades have witnessed a rapid development of renewable energy in buildings globally. China is no exception.

"This paper analyses the financial implications, from the point of view of an investor in renewable energy, which sells the energy for an uncertain price of electricity and decides to take advantage of the Colombian tax policy over the renewable energy. The policy, known as Investment Tax Allowance (ITA), encourages installation of renewable projects in a country traditionally dominated by hydro power. Price is modeled as a non-stationary autoregressive stochastic process with normally distributed error terms. Costs, and uncertain revenue and taxes are considered to assess the financial impact on a solar project when the policy is implemented. Since impact varies according to project ownership, two cases are evaluated: a generation company (GENCO-1) that only owns the solar project; and, an existent generation company (GENCO-2) that owns a portfolio of projects. Results indicate that if ITA is applied, it is likely that the GENCO-1 cannot take the full advantage of the incentive, as opposed to the GENCO-2. Although this policy might not satisfy planner objectives since it does not guarantee the construction of significantly high capacity of new renewable energy projects, it definitely represents an attractive mechanism to decrease tax obligations at the GENCO-2 level. Finally, a theoretical analysis shows that investment cost affects the mean of the present value; whereas tax rates impacts both its mean and standard deviation.",1
"The current paper aims to find scientifically valid approaches to improving the environmental safety of technologies for drying grain materials and granular fertilizers. The methodology for environmental and economic efficiency justification of the energy-saving multi-stage shelf dryers with a convective fluidized bed drying provides design and operational parameters control. Meta-analysis of energy-effective and eco-friendly dryers based on the bibliometric method and the Scopus database is used for this study. The results showed that pollutants concentration in the exhausts could be controlled by modifying the design and the required number of shelves, ensuring the required material residence time to achieve the desired moisture content. The production of electricity using alternative resources like biogas and biofertilizer produced from the anaerobic digestate allows for achieving several Sustainable Development Goals simultaneously. The Goals in scope include Goal 6 Clean Water and Sanitation, Goal 7 Affordable and Clean Energy, Goal 9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure, Goal 12 Responsible Consumption and Production, Goal 13 Climate Action, and Goal 15 Life On Land.",1
"With an increasing wind and photovoltaic share, the German generation mix becomes more weather-dependent. Backup technologies can help to bridge scarcity moments. These rare moments with high prices are the main events for their cost recovery. However, the uncertain revenue flow combined with long payback periods leads to high investment risks and possibly insufficient investment. A high level of needed backup capacity to cover the load does not necessarily go along with a high level of requested backup energy. Both indicators depend on the renewable output and the availability of alternative flexibility sources. We calculate them for two contrasting weather years and three levels of battery capacity by the agent-based-model AMIRIS. As a result, the demonstrated volatile backup energy request in combination with the same level of requested backup capacity for every scenario supports the idea of an alternative remuneration for the provision of capacity next to the energy-only-market.",1
"The oceans sequester carbon from the atmosphere partly as a result of biological productivity. Over much of the ocean surface, this productivity is limited by essential nutrients and we discuss whether it is likely that sequestration can be enhanced by supplying limiting nutrients. Various methods of supply have been suggested and we discuss the efficacy of each and the potential side effects that may develop as a result. Our conclusion is that these methods have the potential to enhance sequestration but that the current level of knowledge from the observations and modelling carried out to date does not provide a sound foundation on which to make clear predictions or recommendations. For ocean fertilization to become a viable option to sequester CO2, we need more extensive and targeted fieldwork and better mathematical models of ocean biogeochemical processes. Models are needed both to interpret field observations and to make reliable predictions about the side effects of large-scale fertilization. They would also be an essential tool with which to verify that sequestration has effectively taken place. There is considerable urgency to address climate change mitigation and this demands that new fieldwork plans are developed rapidly. In contrast to previous experiments, these must focus on the specific objective which is to assess the possibilities of CO2 sequestration through fertilization.",1
"Material efficiency (ME), making products with less material or substituting with less carbon-intensive material without a loss of functionality, can reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and complement other strategies to mitigate climate change. Seven ME strategies for cars and homes in the G7 countries were recently modeled in a study by the International Resource Panel. Modeling indicates that ME strategies focusing on construction and use of homes could lower the overall cumulative emissions in the G7 between 2016 and 2060 by 8.5 Gt CO(2)e (20%), while ME strategies for the production and use of cars could reduce up to 12 Gt (24%). For both homes and cars, the strategy of more intensive use-where fewer or smaller products are required to provide the same basic service-showed the greatest potential. A review of existing ME policies reveals that attention to ME in climate policy has been limited. Policy toward ME has historically focused on waste management rather than GHG reduction. Ex post evaluation of policies that do exist, especially for recycling and related waste strategies, is infrequent. Framing efficient use of materials as a measure primarily intended for climate mitigation is relatively recent and uncommon. Production-related policy opportunities have been neglected because using ME to reduce GHGs is novel in some sectors and because increased ME faces economic and social barriers. Rebound effects where reduction of the cost of housing or transportation can increase material consumption offsetting potential gains, a problem for all efficiency-based approaches, is understudied and not currently addressed through policy.
