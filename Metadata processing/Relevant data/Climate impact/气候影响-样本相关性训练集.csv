1,"Over the past decades, the cost-effectiveness principle or a cost benefit analysis has typically been employed as an assessment tool for the expansion of drinking water utilities. With changing public awareness of the inherent linkages between greenhouse gas emissions and climate change, the addition of this new consideration in the assessment regime has altered the landscape of the traditional evaluation matrix. This paper presents a comparative evaluation based on a suite of carbon footprint and cost data associated with 20 expansion alternatives for a systematic priority analysis of a drinking water infrastructure system in South Florida.

1,"Morocco is a water-scarce developing country with a growing marketable agro-food industry, where untreated or insufficiently treated wastewater represents less than 1% of the irrigation water and treated wastewater reuse is virtually nil. The Government of Morocco is planning to increase the volume of treated wastewater reuse for irrigation agriculture under the current permissive regulation to alleviate the pressure on conventional water sources. However, the reuse of insufficiently treated wastewater implies environmental and human health risks besides the degradation of land and renewable natural resources. This paper shows the feasibility of increasing wastewater reuse for irrigation agriculture in Morocco and how the existing permissive regulation must be improved to force more efficient technologies aimed at ensuring the export of agricultural goods to the most restrictive international markets. The results show how the quality standards of Moroccan regulation are below that of their equivalents in developed countries, as well as in most of the consulted developing countries. After verifying that tertiary treatment is financially feasible, the updated regulation must also consider climatic water scarcity and the locally low cultural perception of environmental and human health risks in order to design optimal solutions."
0,"Here we report the results of our decades-long study on epiphytic communities from two tributary systems of the Szigetkoz section of the Danube River. The main goal of the investigation was to detect changes in the epiphytic communities at structural (core species, changes in the relative abundance of common species) and functional (trait changes) levels as a result of the most important anthropogenic effects on Szigetkoz, i.e., hydro-morphological modifications. We also examined the impact of rehabilitation on the tributary systems in terms of ecological potential. We discovered that mainly motile diatom species characterized the epiphyton due to reduced water volume were introduced into the tributary system after the diversion of the Danube. The ecosystem stabilized in the rehabilitated section, while the non-rehabilitated section showed a worsening tendency, mainly in the parapotamic branches. Our long-term data sets may provide a good basis for comparisons of different aquatic ecosystems, to define changes in the abundance of core species and in the structure of community in response to different anthropogenic pressures. It is fundamental to determine adaptive traits in assessing the impact of global warming stressors on biodiversity."
1,"This paper investigates the ecological-economic sustainability of coral reef socio-ecological systems under fishing and environmental pressures. To achieve this, a dynamic, spatially explicit, multi-species, multi-fleet fisheries model is developed. Stochastic environmental shocks are assumed to alter coral cover and consequently the entire coral reef social-ecological system. The model is calibrated using ecological, socio-economic and environmental data in French Polynesia. Four exploratory fishing strategies and a goal-seeking strategy entitled Stochastic Multi-Species Maximum Sustainable Yield (SMMSY) are compared in terms of ecological-economic outcomes and sustainability of the socio-ecological system. The SMMSY turns out to promote ecological-economic sustainability. It is characterised by a global increase in fishing effort pointing to the relative current under-exploitation of the fishery. SMMSY balances the trophic level of catches after natural shocks and sustains the fundamental herbivore grazing process. SMMSY strategies are also more diversified in terms of temporality, gears, spatial distribution of fishing and target species."
1,"Background: Lyme borreliosis caused by spirochetes of the Borrelia burgdorferi (sensu lato) complex is still the most common tick-borne disease in Europe, posing a considerable threat to public health. The predominant vector in Europe is the widespread hard tick Ixodes ricinus, which also transmits the relapsing fever spirochete B. miyamotoi as well as pathogenic Rickettsiales (Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Rickettsia spp.). To assess the public health risk, a long-term monitoring of tick infection rates with the named pathogens is indispensable. Methods: The present study is the first German 10-year follow-up monitoring of tick infections with Borrelia spp. and co-infections with Rickettsiales. Furthermore, a specific Reverse Line Blot (RLB) protocol for detection of B. miyamotoi and simultaneous differentiation of B. burgdorferi (s.l.) geno-species was established. Results: Overall, 24.0% (505/2100) of ticks collected in the city of Hanover were infected with Borrelia. In detail, 35. 4% (203/573) of adult ticks [38.5% females (111/288) and 32.3% males (92/285)] and 19.8% nymphs (302/1527) were infected, representing consistent infection rates over the 10-year monitoring period. Geno-species differentiation using RLB determined B. miyamotoi in 8.9% (45/505) of positive ticks. Furthermore, a significant decrease in B. afzelii and B. spielmanii infection rates from 2010 to 2015 was observed. Co-infections with Rickettsia spp. and A. phagocytophilum increased between 2010 and 2015 (7.3 vs 10.9% and 0.3 vs 1.1%, respectively). Conclusions: Long-term monitoring is an essential part of public health risk assessment to capture data on pathogen occurrence over time. Such data will reveal shifts in pathogen geno-species distribution and help to answer the question whether or not climate change influences tick-borne pathogens."
1,"Previous dendroclimatical studies have been based on the relationship between tree growth and instrumental climate data recorded at lower land meteorological stations, but the climate conditions somehow differ between sampling sites and distant population centers. Thus, in this study, we performed a comparison between the 152-year reconstruction of June to July mean air temperature on the basis of interpolated meteorological data and instrumental meteorological data. The reconstruction explained 38.7% of the variance in the interpolated temperature data (37.2% after the degrees of freedom were adjusted) and 39.6% of the variance in the instrumental temperature data (38.4% after adjustment for loss of degrees of freedom) during the period 1962-2013 AD. The first global warming (the 1920s) and recent warming (1990-2013) found from the reconstructed temperature series match reasonably well with two other reported summer temperature reconstructions from north-central China. Cold periods occurred three times during 1866-1885, 1901-1921, and 1981-2000, while hot periods occurred four times during 1886-1900, 1922-1933, 1953-1966, and 2001-2007. The extreme warm (cold) years are coherent with the documentary drought (flood) events. Significant 31-22-year, 22-18-year, and 12-8-year cycles indicate major fluctuations in regional temperatures may reflect large-scale climatic shifts."
1,"Increases in frequency of anthropogenic and natural disturbances exacerbated by climate change are disrupting animal movement patterns and, in turn, species distribution and abundance. Habitat models are a valuable approach for predicting how a species or population is distributed across habitats. However, in these models, the environmental characteristics describing habitat are typically constant over time which is inaccurate for a frequently disturbed landscape. The goal of this study is to assess the degree to which frequent disturbances can alter abundance and distribution, to the point of which inferences from static habitat maps are no longer relevant. We simulated individual animal movement in a dynamically disturbed landscape and compared the observed spatial relative abundance to the one predicted from a static habitat model fit to the simulated trajectories. We found that the prediction error is higher when the landscape is disturbed than where there are no disturbances. This result holds even with the addition of life-history and demographic processes to the model which would facilitate the discovery of novel habitat by increasing density-dependent movement, thereby bringing the spatial distribution of individuals closer to a proportion of habitat quality arising from the population at equilibrium assumption underlying most habitat models. In the context of species at risk recovery planning, using habitat models with constant environmental covariates to forecast animal locations in areas with more frequent disturbances as a result of climate change will likely produce inaccurate predictions."
1,"Drought is primarily considered as a natural hazard which is a resultant phenomenon of less rainfall. When an agricultural area constantly received low rainfall during the sowing and growing season of crop, the soil moisture of the cropland goes down and the crop began to wilt, the situation is known as agricultural drought. Present study, used the multi-temporal Sentinel 1 SAR and Landsat optical data to assess the agricultural drought in the part of Odisha state. Initially, to establish the methodology, correlation between NDVI and SAR backscattering has been carried out for the demarcated agricultural landscape of MODIS images derived landcover map of 2019. The drought assessment has been carried out for the month of Jun-July of 2020 and 2021 which is the kharif crop growing season. Thereafter, the backscattering vale range has been identified as a threshold value to delineate the agricultural drought affected areas from other SAR images of various vintages. The study area was more affected by the drought in 2020 compared to 2021. In this study, it is observed that although the area is drought affected, received less rainfall, but due to location in coastal region this area is mostly under cloud cover, therefore, it is very difficult assess the agricultural drought using optical remote sensing data. SAR data is also sensitive to soil moisture condition; therefore, it can be potentially to be used for drought assessment for the coastal agricultural area. (c) 2022 COSPAR.

1,"As permafrost thaws in the Arctic, new subsurface pathways open for the transport of groundwater, energy, and solutes. We identify different ways that these subsurface changes are driving observed surface consequences, including the potential for increased contaminant transport, modification to water resources, and enhanced rates of infrastructure (e.g. buildings and roads) damage. Further, as permafrost thaws it allows groundwater to transport carbon, nutrients, and other dissolved constituents from terrestrial to aquatic environments via progressively deeper subsurface flow paths. Cryohydrogeology, the study of groundwater in cold regions, should be included in northern research initiatives to account for this hidden catalyst of environmental and societal change. the underpinnings of many of these water-related changes lie beneath the depths of these investigations. Thawing of ancient permafrost is opening new subsurface pathways for groundwater flow (Walvoord and Kurylyk, 2016), thereby altering fluxes and distribution of water, energy, and solutes that can be observed at the Earth's surface. Scientific advances in predicting future climate change require integration of subsurface processes within a broader understanding of change in the Arctic, herein broadly defined to include Arctic and subarctic regions. We argue that groundwater is a catalyst of change in Arctic regions, and we call for a more prominent inclusion of cryohydrogeology, the study of groundwater in cold regions, in transdisciplinary research initiatives."
1,"Surface water is the most dynamic land-cover type. Transitions between water and nonwater types (such as vegetation and ice) can happen momentarily. More frequent mapping is necessary to study the changing patterns of water. However, monitoring of long-term global water changes at high spatial resolution and in high temporal frequency is challenging. Here we report the generation of a daily global water map data set at 500-m resolution from 2001 to 2016 based on the daily reflectance time series from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer. Each single-date image is classified into three types: water, ice/snow, and land. Following temporal consistency check and spatial-temporal interpolation for missing data, we conducted a series of validation of the water data set. The producer's accuracy and user's accuracy are 94.61% and 93.57%, respectively, when checked with classification results derived from 30-m resolution Landsat images. Both the producer's accuracy and user's accuracy reached better than 90% when compared with manually interpreted large-sized sample units (1,000mx1,000m) collected in a previous global land cover mapping project. Generally, the global inland water area reaches its maximum (similar to 3.80x10(6)km(2)) in September and minimum (similar to 1.50x10(6)km(2)) in February during an annual cycle. Short-duration water bodies, sea level rise effects, different types of rice field use can be detected from the daily water maps. The size distribution of global water bodies is also discussed from the perspective of the number of water bodies and the corresponding water area. In addition, the daily water maps can precisely reflect water freezing and help correct water areas with inconsistent cloud flags in the MOD09GA quality assessment layer. Plain Language Summary Daily global inland surface water maps are produced from more than 1.9 million frames of satellite images for the period of 2001-2016 with a spatial resolution of 500m. From this time series of maps, we found that the inland surface water on Earth varies greatly in area within an annual cycle. It can reach more than 3.8 million square kilometers in September and reduce to approximately 1.5 million square kilometers in February. We demonstrate that (1) short-duration water bodies in arid areas, which are particularly important to life, can be detected from these daily water maps; (2) sea level rise effects on land submersion can be detected over some gentle-slope coasts like west Florida; and (3) different types of rice field use exist in the world. For example, in California, United States, rice fields are filled with water after harvest to help create a wetland environment for wild birds in the winter."
1,"Background: Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has embarked on a new era of dam building to improve food security and promote economic development. Nonetheless, the future impacts of dams on malaria transmission are poorly understood and seldom investigated in the context of climate and demographic change. Methods: The distribution of malaria in the vicinity of 1268 existing dams in SSA was mapped under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) representative concentration pathways (RCP) 2.6 and 8.5. Population projections and malaria incidence estimates were used to compute population at risk of malaria in both RCPs. Assuming no change in socio-economic interventions that may mitigate impacts, the change in malaria stability and malaria burden in the vicinity of the dams was calculated for the two RCPs through to the 2080s. Results were compared against the 2010 baseline. The annual number of malaria cases associated with dams and climate change was determined for each of the RCPs. Results: The number of dams located in malarious areas is projected to increase in both RCPs. Population growth will add to the risk of transmission. The population at risk of malaria around existing dams and associated reservoirs, is estimated to increase from 15 million in 2010 to 21-23 million in the 2020s, 25-26 million in the 2050s and 28-29 million in the 2080s, depending on RCP. The number of malaria cases associated with dams in malarious areas is expected to increase from 1.1 million in 2010 to 1.2-1.6 million in the 2020s, 2.1-3.0 million in the 2050s and 2.4-3.0 million in the 2080s depending on RCP. The number of cases will always be higher in RCP 8.5 than RCP 2.6. Conclusion: In the absence of changes in other factors that affect transmission (e.g., socio-economic), the impact of dams on malaria in SSA will be significantly exacerbated by climate change and increases in population. Areas without malaria transmission at present, which will transition to regions of unstable transmission, may be worst affected. Modifying conventional water management frameworks to improve malaria control, holds the potential to mitigate some of this increase and should be more actively implemented."
0,"Despite increasing awareness of the public and global health ramifications of climate change, there is a lack of curricula discussing climate change within medical education. Where greater societal awareness and improved scientific understanding have begun to grab the attention of members of the medical education community, there is the precedent, the desire, and the need to incorporate climate-health topics into medical education. We hosted semi-structured interviews (n=9) with faculty members at different institutions across the country who have been involved with climate change education. We pursued a qualitative approach to begin an inter-institutional conversation and better understand what support our colleagues and peers need to expand climate-health education, and we identified a set of key barriers to implementation: Obtaining Institutional Resources, Formalizing Initiative Leadership, and Empowering Faculty Involvement. We also began to appreciate the creative strategies that programs across the country have employed to tackle these challenges. Working with interested students to manage workload, advocating for funded faculty positions, and integrating curricular materials in multiple formats are just a few of the approaches that have helped climate-health initiatives to achieve longevity and penetration in the curriculum. A better identification of the challenges and drivers for success in curricular efforts can provide a roadmap to more efficient implementation of climate-health topics within medical education."
1,"Urban flooding resulting from severe rainstorms is an increasing challenge for cities worldwide due to climate change and rapid urbanization. Model predictive control (MPC) has emerged as a promising approach for realtime management of urban drainage systems to mitigate flooding impacts. However, existing MPC research often relies on idealized rainfall forecasts without adequately accounting for forecast uncertainty, which can compromise the effectiveness of MPC strategies. This study aims to address this critical research gap by developing a framework to evaluate the impacts of forecast uncertainty on MPC performance for urban drainage management. The framework consists of 3 components, (1) martingale model of forecast evolution based on Langevin dynamics for generating rainfall data under different uncertainty conditions (2) MPC, which accepts the rainfall inputs and obtains the real-time control results under different uncertainty conditions and (3) the Scheduling Performance Indicator module, which performs a systematic evaluation of the real-time control system. Using a case study of the Doumen region in Fuzhou City, the results reveal two key findings: First, MPC performance remains close to optimal when forecast uncertainty levels are between 0.1 and 0.3, but deteriorates significantly at uncertainty levels from 0.3 to 0.5. Second, while the MPC error feedback module can occasionally degrade performance for individual events, its overall impact is beneficial in reducing performance deviation risks."
1,"Increased temperatures and more extreme weather patterns associated with global climate change can interact with other factors that regulate animal populations, but many climate change studies do not incorporate other threats to wildlife in their analyses. We used 20years of nest-monitoring data from study sites across a gradient of habitat fragmentation in Missouri, USA, to investigate the relative influence of weather variables (temperature and precipitation) and landscape factors (forest cover and edge density) on the number of young produced per nest attempt (i.e., productivity) for three species of songbirds. We detected a strong forest coverxtemperature interaction for the Acadian Flycatcher (Empidonax virescens) on productivity. Greater forest cover resulted in greater productivity because of reduced brood parasitism and increased nest survival, whereas greater temperatures reduced productivity in highly forested landscapes because of increased nest predation but had no effect in less forested landscapes. The Indigo Bunting (Passerina cyanea) exhibited a similar pattern, albeit with a marginal forest coverxtemperature interaction. By contrast, productivity of the Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis) was not influenced by landscape effects or temperature. Our results highlight a potential difficulty of managing wildlife in response to global change such as habitat fragmentation and climate warming, as the habitat associated with the greatest productivity for flycatchers was also that most negatively influenced by high temperatures. The influence of high temperatures on nest predation (and therefore, nest predators) underscores the need to acknowledge the potential complexity of species' responses to climate change by incorporating a more thorough consideration of community ecology in the development of models of climate impacts on wildlife."
1,"Understanding how climate science can be useful in decisions about the management of freshwater resources requires knowledge of decision makers, their climate-sensitive decisions, and the context in which the decisions are being made. A mixed-methods study found that people managing freshwater resources in Hawaii are highly educated and experienced in diverse professions, they perceive climate change as posing a worrisome risk, and they would like to be better informed about how to adapt to climate change. Decision makers with higher climate literacy seem to be more comfortable dealing with uncertain information. Those with lower climate literacy seem to be more trusting of climate information from familiar sources. Freshwater managers in Hawaii make a wide range of climate-sensitive decisions. These decisions can be characterized on several key dimensions including purpose (optimization and evaluation), time horizon (short term and long term), level of information uncertainty (known, uncertain, deeply uncertain, and completely unknown), and information type (quantitative and qualitative). The climate information most relevant to decision makers includes vulnerability assessments incorporating long-term projections about temperature, rainfall distribution, storms, sea level rise, and streamflow changes at an island or statewide scale. The main barriers to using available climate information include insufficient staff time to locate the information and the lack of a clear legal mandate to use the information. Overall, the results suggest that an integrated and systematic approach is needed to determine where and when uncertain climate information is useful and how a larger set of organizational and individual variables affect decision making."
1,"Questions Knowledge of how extreme drought events induce plant dieback and, eventually, plant mortality, may improve our forecasting of ecosystem change according to future climate projections, especially in Mediterranean drylands. In them, shrublands are the main vegetation communities in transition areas from a subhumid to semi-arid climate. This study analyzed differences in plant dieback after an unusual drought in 2014 and identified their main underlying factors in relation to three groups of explanatory variables: water availability, soil properties and vegetation structure attributes.Location Four Mediterranean shrublands along a climatic gradient in SE Spain.Methods At each experimental field site, we sampled a pool of vegetation structure characteristics, soil depth and soil surface properties, and we also determined water availability by continuously monitoring soil moisture and the microclimate conditions.Results The climatic analysis showed that there was an extreme drought event in 2014, which was below the first percentile of the driest years. Under such conditions, vegetation dieback occurred at all the study sites. However, plant dieback differed between sites and plant biotypes. Subshrubs were the main affected biotype, with diebacks close to 60% at the driest sites, and up to 40% dieback for shrubs depending on their vertical development. Relative extractable water and bare soil surface cover were the best explanatory variables of plant community dieback but changed between plant biotypes. Vegetation structure variables related to plant vertical development (leaf area index [LAI], plant height, phytovolume) were significant explanatory variables of plant dieback in shrubs, subshrubs and grasses. Consecutive dry days fitted the best model to explain subshrub dieback.Conclusions We found that rainfall pattern rather than total annual rainfall was the climatic factor that best determined water availability for plants in Mediterranean drylands. These results also pointed out the relevance of plant structure and soil properties for explaining ecosystem responses to extreme drought."
1,"Objectives: This study aims to improve the understanding of the relationship between exposure to floods and malnutrition in children aged 6-59 months in rural India. Research has focused exclusively on Bangladeshi children, and few controlled epidemiological studies are available. Method: A community-based cross-sectional study of child nutritional status was carried out in 14 flooded and 18 non-flooded villages of Jagatsinghpur district (Orissa) within one month of the September 2008 floods, and similarly affected by flooding in August 2006. Face-to-face interviews were conducted in 757 households in the flooded villages and 816 in the non-flooded communities. Data used in this study were from those households with children aged 6-59 months. In total, 191 and 161 children were measured, respectively. The association between various malnutrition indicators and the exposure to floods was assessed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Results: Adjusted analyses revealed that children in flooded households were more likely stunted compared with those in non-flooded ones (adjusted prevalence ratio 1.60; 95% CI 1.05 to 2.44). The prevalence of underweight was also higher in children living in the flooded communities (adjusted prevalence ratio 1.86; 95% CI 1.04 to 3.30). Further analyses found that the 26-36-month flooded cohort, thus those children younger than 1 year during the precedent flood in August 2006, attained the largest difference in levels of stunting compared with the unexposed group of the same age. Conclusion: Exposure to floods is associated with long-term malnutrition in these rural communities of Orissa, India. Children exposed to floods during their first year of life presented higher levels of chronic malnutrition. Long-term malnutrition prevention programmes after floods should be implemented in flood-prone areas."
1,"Extreme precipitation triggered by climate change is a hot issue of global concern. This study investigates changes in temporal trends of precipitation at Jinan City, Shandong Province over the last six decades. It first constructs a long series of measured daily precipitation data (1951-2017) and then exploits the relative variability, Mann-Kendall, and rescaled range analysis (R/S analysis) methods to update precipitation characteristics. Results indicate that: (1) annual precipitation varies over 116%, with 74.1% of total precipitation concentrated from June to September, especially for heavy rains and storm days; (2) at the 95% confidence level, the annual rainfall does not increase significantly (U = 1.15), but there is a significant upward trend in the spring (U = 2.08), whereas there is no significant downward trend in the fall (U = -1.03); (3) precipitation sequence mutates in 1990, consistent with spring precipitation series, while there are two to four mutations in summer, autumn, and winter. The above results will provide the theoretical basis and data support for the rational development of water resources in Jinan; meanwhile, studying the law of precipitation changes in Jinan City has important practical significance for flood disaster prevention."
1,"Stomatal opening in plant leaves is regulated through a balance of carbon and water exchange under different environmental conditions. Accurate estimation of stomatal regulation is crucial for understanding how plants respond to changing environmental conditions, particularly under climate change. A new generation of optimality-based modelling schemes determines instantaneous stomatal responses from a balance of trade-offs between carbon gains and hydraulic costs, but most such schemes do not account for biochemical acclimation in response to drought. Here, we compare the performance of six instantaneous stomatal optimisation models with and without accounting for photosynthetic acclimation. Using experimental data from 37 plant species, we found that accounting for photosynthetic acclimation improves the prediction of carbon assimilation in a majority of the tested models. Photosynthetic acclimation contributed significantly to the reduction of photosynthesis under drought conditions in all tested models. Drought effects on photosynthesis could not accurately be explained by the hydraulic impairment functions embedded in the stomatal models alone, indicating that photosynthetic acclimation must be considered to improve estimates of carbon assimilation during drought. Accounting for photosynthetic acclimation improves the predictions of carbon assimilation in all the stomatal optimisation models evaluated. The influence of drought on photosynthesis cannot be fully explained by the hydraulic impairment function of the stomatal models alone."
0,"Significant national discourse has focused on the idea of structural inequalities and structural racism within a variety of societal sectors, including healthcare. This perspective provides an understanding of the historic and pervasive nature of structural inequalities and structural racism; uses well-known frameworks in health equity research for conceptualizing structural inequality and structural racism; offers a summary of the consequences of structural inequalities and structural racism on modern-day health outcomes; and concludes with strategies and suggestions for a way forward. Recommended strategies across different sectors of influence include (a) employment and economic empowerment sector: creating capacity for individuals to earn livable wages; (b) education sector: developing new funding structures to ensure equal opportunities are offered to all; (c) healthcare sector: prioritizing universal access to high-quality health care, including mental health treatment; (d) housing sector: improving access to affordable, safe housing through public-private partnerships; (e) criminal justice sector: focusing reform on restorative justice that is people-centric instead of punitive; and (f) environmental sector: creating sustainable systems that alleviate downstream consequences of climate change. The recommended strategies account for the mutually reinforcing and pervasive nature of structural inequalities/structural racism and target key sectors of influence to enhance overall health outcomes and achieve equity regardless of race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status."
1,"This paper uses panel cointegration techniques and Granger causality tests to investigate the dynamic causal links between per capita renewable energy consumption, agricultural value added (AVA), carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, and real gross domestic product (GDP) for a panel of five North Africa countries spanning the period 1980-2011. In the short-run, Granger causality tests show the existence of bidirectional causality between CO2 emissions and agriculture; a unidirectional causality running from agriculture to GDP, from GDP to renewable energy consumption, and from renewable energy consumption to agriculture. In the long-run, there is bidirectional causality between agriculture and CO2 emissions; a unidirectional causality running from renewable energy to agriculture and to emissions, and from output to agriculture and to emissions. Long-run parameter estimates show that an increase in GDP or in renewable energy consumption (including combustible and waste) increases CO2 emissions, whereas an increase in agricultural value added reduces CO2 emissions. As policy recommendation, North African authorities should encourage renewable energy consumption, and especially clean renewable energy such as solar or wind, as this improves agricultural production and help to combat global warming.

1,"For nine sites in the southern Great Plains, the decade of the Dust Bowl was consistently warmer than 1951 to 1980 ''normal.'' It also tended to be drier, but less consistently so. At four of the nine sites, the combination of consistently higher temperature and mostly lower precipitation had a cumulative effect over the 1930s, making the entire decade a period of agricultural drought as characterized by the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI). Episodes of extreme drought occurred at many sites, particularly in 1934 in Nebraska. Temperature and precipitation changes predicted by two general circulation models (GCMs) at the upper range of current climate model predictions for doubled concentrations of CO2 + 4.2-degrees-C and + 4.0-degrees-C mean global surface air temperature warming) suggest drought conditions as defined by the PDSI that are worse than those for the 1930s for all stations. Droughtiness is projected to increase overall, even when the GCM climate change scenarios produce little change or even increases in precipitation. In most instances, the mean GCM-predicted drought conditions equal or exceed the extreme drought years of the decade. When dynamic crop growth models were run in combination with the GCM-predicted climates, simulated wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and corn (Zea mays L.) yields were obtained that were generally lower (approximately 30%) than those of simulations for the actual climate of the 1930s. The crop model simulations indicated that the predicted climate change is likely to be less detrimental to a crop such as wheat, whose main growing period is in the spring, than to a typical summer crop such as corn. The overall results of this study suggest that the Dust Bowl experience of the 1930s may be characterized as a preliminary analog of possible future climate conditions for the southern Great Plains, with the importance difference that the higher projections of GCM warming produce more severe climatic consequences than the Dust Bowl."
1,"Aim Land use and climate are two major components of global environmental change but our understanding of their simultaneous and interactive effects upon biodiversity is still limited. Here, we investigated the relationship between the species richness of neophytes, i.e. non-native vascular plants introduced after 1500 AD, and environmental covariates to draw implications for future dynamics under land-use and climate change. Location Switzerland, Central Europe. Methods The distribution of vascular plants was derived from a systematic national grid of 1 km2 quadrates (n = 456; Swiss Biodiversity Monitoring programme) including 1761 species, 122 of which were neophytes. Generalized linear models (GLMs) were used to correlate neophyte species richness with environmental covariates. The impact of land-use and climate change was thereafter evaluated by projections for the years 2020 and 2050 using scenarios of moderate and strong changes for climate warming (IPCC) and urban sprawl (NRP 54). Results Mean annual temperature and the amount of urban areas explained neophyte species richness best, with a high predictive power of the corresponding model (cross-validated D2 = 0.816). Climate warming had a stronger impact on the potential increase in the mean neophyte species richness (up to 191% increase by 2050) than ongoing urban sprawl (up to 10% increase) independently from variable interactions and model extrapolations to non-analogue environments. Main conclusions In contrast to other vascular plants, the prediction of neophyte species richness at the landscape scale in Switzerland requires few variables only, and regions of highest species richness of the two groups do not coincide. The neophyte species richness is basically driven by climatic (temperature) conditions, and urban areas additionally modulate small-scale differences upon this coarse-scale pattern. According to the projections climate warming will contribute to the future increase in neophyte species richness much more than ongoing urbanization, but the gain in new neophyte species will be highest in urban regions."
1,"Population irruptions of Pacific crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster cf. solaris) have caused substantial damage to coral reefs, but it is largely unknown how this asteroid will fare in a warmer ocean. We exposed these starfish to one of four thermal treatments, with final temperatures of 26 degrees C (control, annual average), 28 degrees C (summer average), 30 degrees C (summer maximum) and 32 degrees C (predicted summer maximum by 2100). We measured the righting time, movement rate, standard metabolic rate and probability of survival of the crown-of-thorns starfish at various timepoints over similar to 60 days. We found that while temperature did not affect righting time, it did significantly affect movement rate. The movement rate of starfish increased across the 26 to 30 degrees C range, with those at 28 degrees C and 30 degrees C moving 18 and 27% faster than those at the control temperature. Similarly, the standard metabolic rate of starfish increased from 26 to 30 degrees C, with metabolism 100% and 260% faster at 28 degrees C and 30 degrees C compared to those at the 26 degrees C control. At 32 degrees C, individual starfish exhibited a 14% slower movement rate, a 33% slower metabolic rate, and also exhibited a fourfold lower probability of survival than those at 30 degrees C. These results indicate that 32 degrees C is above the thermal optimum of crown-of-thorns starfish, suggesting that prolonged exposure to temperatures that are expected to be regularly exceeded under near-future climate change may be detrimental to this species."
1,"Tropical mountain permafrost has a unique thermal regime due to ground surface exposure to strong solar radiation. The intensity of the surface offset resulting from snow cover also strongly affects the absence or presence of permafrost. Latent heat transfer and reflected solar radiation (higher albedo) that occur during the snow-covered season contribute to a positive feedback that cools the ground. Eleven ground temperature monitoring sites were established on the mountain at 2,780 to 5,820 m.a.s.l. The geothermal heat flow is locally high in the caldera of this volcano, as shown by borehole temperature data. Permafrost is located near the only glacier entirely within the caldera (Furtwangler). These three-year continuous records of ground temperature data encompass years of high and low snow cover. Our results show that the current lower boundary of permafrost is slightly above summit altitude and relict permafrost is present due to the influence of saturated sand on latent heat transfer. Permafrost tends to be lost more rapidly during drought years. The remaining permafrost seems likely to disappear in the future. The presence of permafrost and its thermal resistance depends on the ice content of caldera sand and the duration of snow cover."
1,"The biomass of aquatic organisms largely determines the mass and energy flow within an ecosystem, but the long-term impact of environmental change on biomass is not well constrained for a number of clades. Here, we test the hypothesis that bivalve biomass is negatively impacted by warming climate over time. This study is based on a fossil marine bivalve fauna recovered from hemipelagic sediments deposited in the eastern Mediterranean during climate cycles (marine isotope stages (MIS) 22-18; 900-712 kyr B.P.) of the Early-Middle Pleistocene Transition. We reconstruct individual shell biomasses from fossils and discuss the various biotic and abiotic factors that controlled long-term shell biomass patterns across this important interval in the Earth climate system. The results are contrary to the original hypothesis, suggesting that the response to temperature is not universal. Nevertheless, a decrease in median biomass is observed during the MIS 19 warm period and can be possibly attributed to the combined effect of multiple drivers that cooperated at that critical time in the past, including higher temperature and primary productivity, reduced ventilation of the sea floor, biodiversity changes due to geographic range shifts, and considering species-and age-specific thermal tolerances. Generally, bivalve biomass at the community level is determined by relative abundance and shell biomass-frequency distribution. In our study, the relative abundance and median biomass of small species do not increase or decrease, respectively, in warmer periods. However, larger species are negatively affected by warming both in terms of relative abundance and biomass."
1,"Simple Summary The decline in global biodiversity due to habitat loss, climate change, and human activities necessitates effective monitoring. Flying insects, such as pollinators, which are crucial for ecosystem functions, require a thorough assessment. While informative, conventional methods, including hand netting, transect surveys, and pan traps, are labour-intensive or offer snapshots of limited scope. This study conducts a comparative analysis of traditional and innovative methods involving the recording and analysis of buzzing sounds emitted by flying insects. Insect abundance, reported as counts for traditional methods gathered by pan traps, and average buzzes per hour, measured by acoustic IoT (Internet of Things) sensors, were correlated. This finding suggests that acoustic automatic monitoring shows the potential to circumvent the limitations of conventional methods, emphasising continuous, non-intrusive monitoring for robust data acquisition. The development of passive detection devices will pave the way to implement new, sustainable approaches to enhance conservation efforts and ecosystem management, advancing our understanding of flying insect dynamics amidst global biodiversity challenges.Abstract The global loss of biodiversity is an urgent concern requiring the implementation of effective monitoring. Flying insects, such as pollinators, are vital for ecosystems, and establishing their population dynamics has become essential in conservation biology. Traditional monitoring methods are labour-intensive and show time constraints. In this work, we explore the use of bioacoustic sensors for monitoring flying insects. Data collected at four Italian farms using traditional monitoring methods, such as hand netting and pan traps, and bioacoustic sensors were compared. The results showed a positive correlation between the average number of buzzes per hour and insect abundance measured by traditional methods, primarily by pan traps. Intraday and long-term analysis performed on buzzes revealed temperature-related patterns of insect activity. Passive acoustic monitoring proved to be effective in estimating flying insect abundance, while further development of the algorithm is required to correctly identify insect taxa. Overall, innovative technologies, such as bioacoustic sensors, do not replace the expertise and data quality provided by professionals, but they offer unprecedented opportunities to ease insect monitoring to support conservation biodiversity efforts."
1,"Growing evidence suggests short-duration climate events may drive community structure and composition more directly than long-term climate means, particularly at ecotones where taxa are close to their physiological limits. Here we use an empirical habitat model to evaluate the role of microclimate during a strong El Nio in structuring a tropical montane cloud forest's upper limit and composition in Hawai'i. We interpolate climate surfaces, derived from a high-density network of climate stations, to permanent vegetation plots. Climatic predictor variables include (1) total rainfall, (2) mean relative humidity, and (3) mean temperature representing non-El Nio periods and a strong El Nio drought. Habitat models explained species composition within the cloud forest with non-El Nio rainfall; however, the ecotone at the cloud forest's upper limit was modeled with relative humidity during a strong El Nio drought and secondarily with non-El Nio rainfall. This forest ecotone may be particularly responsive to strong, short-duration climate variability because taxa here, particularly the isohydric dominant Metrosideros polymorpha, are near their physiological limits. Overall, this study demonstrates moisture's overarching influence on a tropical montane ecosystem, and suggests that short-term climate events affecting moisture status are particularly relevant at tropical ecotones. This study further suggests that predicting the consequences of climate change here, and perhaps in other tropical montane settings, will rely on the skill and certainty around future climate models of regional rainfall, relative humidity, and El Nio."
1,"The number of weather station is about 150 points in Japan. In order to know the detailed environmental conditions, this number is insufficient. If there is provided a detailed environmental conditions, it can be useful in daily life and health. By global environmental change such as global warming, abnormal weather events are occurring and there has been an increase in boiling hot day in the summer. In the scorching heat, heatstroke patients have been increase. On the other hand, the radiation is harmful to the human body. Thus, the prevention of adverse effects caused by environment is very important. We had proposed some system for prevention of heat stroke. However, these systems cannot measure the risk of radiation dose. Therefore, we propose a new system for monitoring environment using smartphone. This system measures the variety of environmental data such as temperature, humidity, and radiation. By managing the environmental data on the server, this system can display the environmental data in various places. This system can measure the risk of heat stroke. This system can also provide advice for health."
1,"Climate change not only affects the water resource system but also has a great impact on the aquatic ecosystem, which is complexly linked to various organic and inorganic matter. It is difficult to simulate the current aquatic ecosystem and predict the future system due to the immensity and complexity of aquatic ecosystems; however, a spatial analysis of future aquatic ecological health is necessary if we are to adapt and take action against future climate change. In this study, we evaluated the aquatic ecological health of the Han River basin under the future climate change RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios using three indices: fish assessment index (FAI), trophic diatom index (TDI), and benthic macroinvertebrate index (BMI). For this, we developed the SWAT-XGBoost linkage algorithm, and the algorithm accuracy for the FAI, TDI, and BMI was 89.3 similar to 95.2%. In the case of the FAI and BMI assessment of aquatic ecological health, the upstream Han River was classified as a hot spot. In the case of the TDI, the downstream area of the Han River was classified as a cold spot. However, as the current TDI downstream was classified as grades D and E, continuous management is needed."
1,"The hydrology of the Himalayan region, known as the water tower of Asia, is undergoing rapid transformations due to climate change and growing human influences, and it is known that this region is one of those most vulnerable to climate change. Numerous studies have examined the changes in the hydrology of Nepal, which includes a significant upstream portion of the Himalayas. However, there is a lack of holistic studies on the spatial-temporal evolution of hydrologic dynamics over the entire nation and over long periods. In this study, we present a comprehensive assessment of the changes in river discharge, flood occurrence, and terrestrial water storage (TWS) across all river basins in Nepal using hydrological-hydrodynamic simulations spanning for 40 years (1979-2018) at similar to 5 km spatial resolution, and downscaled flood attributes at similar to 90 m resolution. The spatio-temporal variations in river discharge and inundation extent are examined through mapping of decadal trends using a quantile analysis method. The results indicate that the dynamics of river discharge has evolved varyingly across different river basins. The evolution pattern within a basin generally agrees with that at the basin outlet, but notable exceptions are found, indicating high hydro-climatic heterogeneity within the basins. The decadal evaluation of flood dynamics over major flooded areas suggests that inundation dynamics is strongly influenced by various flow characteristics, including the timing, duration, and magnitude, and that the evolution of flood dynamics is more complex than that of river discharge. Results indicate that the TWS dynamics over entire Nepal is strongly modulated by the variations in subsurface water storage, and groundwater storage has been in continuous decline (-1.74 cm/year) in the recent decades (2002-2016). This study provides a basis to advance the understanding of long-term hydrologic changes in the Himalayan region with important implications for improved water resources management."
1,"Climate change is altering the seasonal accumulation and ablation of snow across mid-latitude mountainous regions in the Northern Hemisphere with profound implications for the water resources available to downstream communities and environments. Despite decades of empirical and model-based research on snowmelt-driven streamflow, our ability to predict whether streamflow will increase or decrease in a changing climate remains limited by two factors. First, predictions are fundamentally hampered by high spatial and temporal variability in the processes that control net snow accumulation and ablation across mountainous environments. Second, we lack a consistent and testable framework to coordinate research to determine which dominant mechanisms influencing seasonal snow dynamics are most and least important for streamflow generation in different basins. Our data-driven review marks a step towards the development of such a framework. We first conduct a systematic literature review that synthesizes knowledge about seasonal snowmelt-driven streamflow and how it is altered by climate change, highlighting unsettled questions about how annual streamflow volume is shaped by changing snow dynamics. Drawing from literature, we then propose a framework comprised of three testable, inter-related mechanisms-snow season mass and energy exchanges, the intensity of snow season liquid water inputs, and the synchrony of energy and water availability. Using data for 537 catchments in the United States, we demonstrate the utility of each mechanism and suggest that streamflow prediction will be more challenging in regions with multiple interacting mechanisms. This framework is intended to inform the research community and improve management predictions as it is tested and refined."
1,"Unlike much of the contiguous United States, new hydropower development continues in the Far North, where climate models project precipitation will likely increase over the next century. Regional complexities in the Arctic and sub-Arctic, such as glacier recession and permafrost thaw, however, introduce uncertainties about the hydrologic responses to climate change that impact water resource management. This work reviews hydroclimate changes in the Far North and their impacts on hydropower; it provides a template for application of current techniques for prediction and estimating uncertainty, and it describes best practices for integrating science into management and decision-making. The growing number of studies on hydrologic impacts suggests that information resulting from climate change science has matured enough that it can and should be integrated into hydropower scoping, design, and management. Continuing to ignore the best available information in lieu of status quo planning is likely to prove costly to society in the long term."
0,"Several biophysical factors are leading to the loss of biodiversity, among them the dominance of exotic invasive species on native communities is important. Their dominance can lead to changes in the structure of insect communities, by competing and displacing native species to other crops or habitats. These changes can impact the herbivore's natural enemies in invaded areas by diverging them from suitable herbivores and altering their biological control process. The development of edible insects and derived products at an industrial scale can also have an impact on the local fauna by the risks of spillover and accidental release in nature. Several area-wide integrated pest management programs are also using the sterile insect technique to control insect pests and disease' vectors. This technique is becoming largely used; however, its application as 'non-intrusive to the environment' is controversial particularly when eradication is concerning species that are at the basis of food webs."
1,"Climate change is causing the intensification of both rainfall and droughts in temperate climatic zones, which will affect soil drying and rewetting cycles and associated processes such as soil greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes. We investigated the effect of soil rewetting following a prolonged natural drought on soil emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) in an agricultural field recently converted from 22 years in the USDA Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). We compared responses to those in a similarly managed field with no CRP history and to a CRP reference field. We additionally compared soil GHG emissions measured by static flux chambers with off-site laboratory analysis versus in situ analysis using a portable quantum cascade laser and infrared gas analyzer. Under growing season drought conditions, average soil N2O fluxes ranged between 0.2 and 0.8 mu g N m(-2) min(-1) and were higher in former CRP soils and unaffected by nitrogen (N) fertilization. After 18 days of drought, a 50 mm rewetting event increased N2O fluxes by 34 and 24 fold respectively in the former CRP and non-CRP soils. Average soil CO2 emissions during drought ranged from 1.1 to 3.1 mg C m(-2) min(-1) for the three systems. CO2 emissions increased 2 fold after the rewetting and were higher from soils with higher C contents. Observations are consistent with the hypothesis that during drought soil N2O emissions are controlled by available C and following rewetting additionally influenced by N availability, whereas soil CO2 emissions are independent of short-term N availability. Finally, soil GHG emissions estimated by off-site and in situ methods were statistically identical. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

1,"Modeling of environmental phenomena is usually confounded by the influence of multiple factors existing at different time and spatial scales. Bayesian modeling is presumed to be the best approach for modeling such complex systems. Using a Bayesian hierarchical inferential framework, we employed a multi-source data approach (i.e. remote sensing derived anthropogenic, climatic and topographic set of variables) to model Carbon (C) stock in a managed plantation forest ecosystem in Zimbabwe's Eastern Highlands. We therefore investigated how two related multi-data sources of new generation remote sensing derived ancillary information influence C stock prediction required for building sustainable capacity in C monitoring and reporting. Two mainstream models constructed from Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 derived vegetation indices coupled with climatic and topographic covariates were used to predict C stocks using forest inventory data collected using spatial coverage sampling. A multi-source data driven approach to C stock prediction yielded slightly lower predictions for both the Landsat-8 ($1 \le MgCh{a<^>{ - 1}} \le 135)$1 <= MgCha-1 <= 135) and the Sentinel-2 ($1 \le MgCh{a<^>{ - 1}} \le 130)$1 <= MgCha-1 <= 130)-based C stock models than C stock predictions published in related studies. Distance to settlements ($DIST$DIST) and $NDVI$NDVI are significant predictors of C stock with the Sentinel-2-based C stock model outperforming its Landsat-8 model variant in terms of prediction accuracy. The Sentinel-2-based C stock model resulted in a 1.17 MgCha-1 Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) with a ($1 \le MgCh{a<^>{ - 1}} \le4)$1 <= MgCha-1 <= 4) 95% credible interval whilst the Landsat-8-based C stock counterpart gave a 2.16 MgCha-1 RMSE with a ($2 \le MgCh{a<^>{ - 1}} \le4)$2 <= MgCha-1 <= 4) associated 95% credible interval. Despite a multi-source data prediction approach to the modeling of C stock in a managed plantation forest ecosystem set-up, the issues of scale still play a major role in modeling spatial variability of natural resource variables. Both climatic and topographic derived ancillary data are not significant predictors of C stock under the present modeling conditions. Accurate and precise accounting of C stock for climate change mitigation and action can best be done at landscape scales rather than local scale as the scale of variation for climate-change-related variables vary at larger spatial scales than the ones utilized in the present study."
1,"Phyto-ecological studies are essential in understanding community structure, organization and their response to changes in other environmental factors. In this study we analyzed the phytosociological and soil characteristics of Phytolacca acinosa communities and their correlation. 110 quadrats were laid across ten randomly selected sites in Kashmir Himalaya, India. Soil analysis was done using standard protocols. Overall, 161 species were recorded, belonging to 128 genera and 49 families. The species richness (SR) ranges from 27 to 83. Highest IVI was recorded for Poa angustifolia (60.06) and least for Berberis lycium, Abies pindrow, Plectranthus ragosus, and Ailanthus altissima (0.37 each). P. acinosa showed 100% random associations with other plant species. Soil properties varied significantly across the selected sites. Significant positive correlation was found between species richness (SR), Organic matter (OM) (r = 0.79), Organic carbon (OC) (r = 0.79) and Shannon-Wiener index (H) (r = 0.92). Nitrogen content also showed positive correlation with SR and H. Floristic composition of P. acinosa assemblages was governed by soil properties and habitat characteristics of sampling sites. Areas with highest floral diversity had high soil fertility while areas with low soil fertility possess lower diversity and need restoration. The knowledge may prove helpful in management of these habitats, boost conservation and mitigate the effects of changing climate."
1,"Modeling potential global redistribution of terrestrial vegetation frequently is based on bioclimatic classifications which relate static regional vegetation zones (biomes) to a set of static climate parameters. The equilibrium character of the relationships limits our confidence in their application to scenarios of rapidly changing climate. Such assessments could be improved if vegetation migration and succession would be incorporated as response variables in model simulations. We developed the model MOVE (Migration Of VEgetation), to simulate the geographical implications of different rates of plant extirpation and in-migration. We used the model to study the potential impact on terrestrial carbon stocks of climate shifts hypothesized from a doubling of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentration. The model indicates that the terrestrial vegetation and soil could release carbon; the amount of this carbon pulse depends on the rate of migration relative to the rate of climate change. New temperate and boreal biomes, not found on the landscape today, increase rapidly in area during the first 100 years of simulated response to climate change. Their presence for several centuries and their gradual disappearance after the climate ceases to change adds uncertainty in calculating future terrestrial carbon fluxes."
1,"Under the European Water Framework Directive (WFD), the ecological status of German streams is regularly assessed using benthic invertebrates as one status indicator. However, the ecological status assessment in 2018/19, was largely influenced by an extreme over-seasonal low flow event. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of such an event on the last status assessment by performing a before- and-after comparison based on invertebrate data of 222 water bodies. The results of this study indicate that the generalized assumption of a supraregional deterioration of the ecological status as a result of extreme low water is not possible. Significant deterioration of status was observed only in waterbody types 11 and 16. The status deteriorated by half a status class. For the other water bodies, in individual assessment metrics were evident, but had little effect on the overall assessment. Against the background of climate change, measures to improve the status of waterbodies should increasingly take into account the effects of low water."
1,"Fire is a major natural disturbance factor in boreal forests, and the frequency of forest fires is predicted to increase due to climate change. Nitrogen (N) is a key determinant of carbon sequestration in boreal forests because the shortage of N limits tree growth. We studied changes in N pools and fluxes, and the overall N balance across a 155-year non stand replacing fire chronosequence in sub-arctic Pinus sylvestris forests in Finland. Two years after the fire, total ecosystem N pool was 622 kg ha(-1) of which 16% was in the vegetation, 8% in the dead biomass and 76% in the soil. 155 years after the fire, total N pool was 960 kg ha(-1), with 27% in the vegetation, 3% in the dead biomass and 69% in the soil. This implies an annual accumulation rate of 2.28 kg ha(-1) which was distributed equally between soil and biomass. The observed changes in N pools were consistent with the computed N balance +2.11 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) over the 155-year post-fire period. Nitrogen deposition was an important component of the N balance. The biological N fixation increased with succession and constituted 9% of the total N input during the 155 post-fire years. N2O fluxes were negligible (< 0.01 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) and did not differ among post-fire age classes. The number and intensity of microbial genes involved in N cycling were lower at the site 60 years after fire compared to the youngest and the oldest sites indicating potential differences in soil N cycling processes. The results suggest that in sub-arctic pine forests, the non-stand-replacing, intermediate severity fires decrease considerably N pools in biomass but changes in soil and total ecosystem N pools are slight. Current fire-return interval does not seem to pose a great threat to ecosystem productivity and N status in these sub-arctic forests."
0,"Since the inception of sustainable development (SD), there has been a somewhat ignored contradiction between paradigms that are ecosystem-based and paradigms that are human-based or purely economic. We suggest that this contradiction can be unified through a balance of the two. The Chinese Yin-Yang philosophy is applied as a tool or approach to seeking balance between these ecocentric and anthropocentric paradigms. Priority education policy design for the merging of ecology and health are projected through an Ecohealth lens in response to increasing SD challenges and the intention of the international Ecohealth organization to contribute to SD goals. Meeting SD goals along the nexus of health and environment is further considered through early-careerist cultural assessments and projections. The groups considered for their professional image of the future are: members of the Ecohealth Association Student Section and Chinese early-careerists participating in a related conference. In response to SD goals, a problem-based learning design is suggested as an education policy priority. Rather than approaching SD as a boolean concept, for example, by either focusing on ecosystem sustainability or economic development, we suggest education policy for programmes and curriculums that will help emerging professionals balance these paradigms, so as to best address national and global challenges."
1,"Understanding the distribution of hyperaccumulators helps to implement more efficient phytoremediation strategies of contaminated sites, however, limited information is available. Here, we investigated the geographical distribution of the first-known arsenic-hyperaccumulator Pteris vittata in China and the key factors under two climate change scenarios (SSP 1-2.6 and SSP 5-8.5) at two time points (2030 and 2070). Species distribution model (MaxEnt) was applied to examine P. vittata distribution based on 399 samples from field surveys and existing specimen records. Further, among 23 environmental factors, 11 variables were used in the MaxEnt model, including temperature, precipitation, elevation, soil property, and UV-B radiation. The results show that P. vittata can grow in similar to 23% of the regions in China. Specifically, it is mainly distributed in 11 provinces of southern China, including Hainan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Fujian, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu. Besides, eastern Sichuan, and southern Henan, Shaanxi, and Anhui are suitable for P. vittata growth. Under two climate change scenarios, P. vittata distribution in China would decrease by similar to 5.76-7.46 x 10(4) km(2) in 2030 and similar to 3.22-4.68 x 10(4) km(2) in 2070, with southern Henan and most Jiangsu being unsuitable for P. vittata growth. Among the 11 environmental variables, the minimum temperature of coldest month (bio6) and temperature annual range (bio7) are the two key factors limiting P. vittata distribution. At bio6 <-5 degrees C and/or bio7 >33 degrees C, the regions are unsuitable for P. vittata growth. Based on the MaxEnt model, precipitation had limited effects, so P. vittata can probably survive under both dry and moist environments. This study helps guide phytoremediation of As-polluted soils using P. vittata and provides an example to evaluate habitat suitability of hyperaccumulators at international scales.

1,"The wellbeing of mountain communities is determined by the availability and accessibility of ecosystem goods and services. We assessed the relationship between forest quality and wellbeing of local communities of Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve (NDBR) in the Upper Ganga River Basin, Western Himalayas, India. We used 14 relevant Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations as indicators to assess wellbeing. Data on these indicators were collected in 22 villages that were selected based on secondary demographic information, remoteness, and the state of the forest resources, which we classified into degraded and less-degraded. Semi-structured questionnaire-based interviews were conducted in randomly selected households (n = 764). The households located close to forests scored higher on wellbeing indicators than the households located further away from forests as they have better accessibility to forest resources and freshwater, which provides alternatives to market and agricultural products. Households with access to less-degraded resources also had access to wild fruits, vegetables, and medicinal plants adding to their food and health security. Our study found that the combination of climate change, declining forest resources, and the expansion of the market-based economy is leading to shifts in traditional cropping patterns and hence the nutritional status and forest use patterns of local people, making them vulnerable to diseases and hunger. Accessibility to an intact forest patch near a village contributes to the wellbeing of people and increases their resilience in the face of climate change and the changes dictated by the market forces."
1,"Emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases are an expanding global threat to public health, security, and economies. Increasing populations, urbanization, deforestation, climate change, anti-vaccination movements, war, and international travel are some of the contributing factors to this trend. The recent Ebola, MERS-CoV, and Zika outbreaks demonstrated we are insufficiently prepared to respond with proven safe and effective countermeasures (i.e., vaccines and therapeutics). The State University of New York Upstate Medical University and the Trudeau Institute convened a summit of key opinion and thought leaders in the life sciences and biomedical research and development enterprises to explore global biopreparedness challenges, take an inventory of existing capabilities and capacities related to preparation and response, assess current gaps, and prospect what could be done to improve our position. Herein we describe the summit proceedings, Translational Immunology Supporting Biomedical Countermeasure Development for Emerging Vector-borne Viral Diseases, held October 2-3, 2018, at the Trudeau Institute in Saranac Lake, NY."
1,"Climate is currently warming due to anthropogenic impact on the Earth's atmosphere. To better understand the processes and feedbacks within the climate system that underlie this accelerating warming trend, it is useful to examine past periods of abrupt climate change that were driven by natural forcings. Glaciers provide an excellent natural laboratory for reconstructing the climate of the past as they respond sensitively to climate oscillations. Therefore, we study glacier systems and their behavior during the transition from colder to warmer climate phases, focusing on the period between 15 and 10 ka. Using a combination of geomorphological mapping and beryllium-10 surface exposure dating, we reconstruct ice extents in two glaciated valleys of the Silvretta Massif in the Austrian Alps. The mountain glacier record shows that general deglaciation after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) was repeatedly interrupted by glacier stabilization or readvance, perhaps during the Oldest Dryas to Bolling transition (landform age: 14.4 +/- 1.0 ka) and certainly during the Younger Dryas (YD; 12.9-11.7 ka) and the Early Holocene (EH; 12-10 ka). The oldest landform age indicates a lateral ice margin that postdates the 'Gschnitz' stadial (ca. 17-16 ka) and predates the YD. It shows that local inner-alpine glaciers were more extensive until the onset of the Bolling warm phase (ca. 14.6 ka), or possibly even into the Bolling than during the subsequent YD. The second age group, ca. 80 m below the (pre-)Bolling ice margin, indicates glacier extents during the YD cold phase and captures the spatial and temporal fine structure of glacier retreat during this period. The ice surface lowered approximately 50-60 m through the YD, which is indicative of milder climate conditions at the end of the YD compared to its beginning. Finally, the third age group falls into a period of more substantial warming, the YD-EH transition, and shows discontinuous glacier retreat during the glacial to interglacial transition. The new geochronologies synthesized with pre-existing moraine records from the Silvretta Massif evidence multiple cold phases that punctuated the general post-LGM warming trend and illustrate the sensitive response of Silvretta glaciers to abrupt climate oscillations in the past."
1,"Mountain regions harbor unique and rich biodiversity, forming an important part of our global life support system. This rich biodiversity underpins the ecological intactness and functioning of mountain ecosystems, which are imperative for the provision of key ecosystem services. A considerable amount of data are required to assess ecological intactness and ecosystem functioning and, given the profound anthropogenic pressures many mountain regions are being subjected to, are urgently needed. However, data on mountain biodiversity remain lacking. The essential biodiversity variables (EBVs) framework can help focus efforts related to detecting, investigating, predicting, and managing global biodiversity change, but has not yet been considered in the context of mountains. Here, we review key biological processes and physical phenomena that strongly influence mountain biodiversity and ecosystems and elucidate their associations with potential mountain EBVs. We identify seven EBVs of highest relevance for tracking and understanding the most critical drivers and responses of mountain biodiversity change. If they are implemented, the selected EBVs will contribute useful information to inform management and policy interventions seeking to halt mountain biodiversity loss and maintain functional mountain ecosystems."
1,"Glacial varves can detail ice-margin positions and provide a proxy for meltwater discharge at resolutions comparable to those of the Greenland ice core archives, and thus they can be critical paleorecords for assessing the response of both ancient and modern ice sheets to climate change. Here we provide an similar to 1500 yr varve chronology straddling the Younger Dryas (YD)-Holocene boundary (11.65 cal. kyr B.P.), the first such chronology in North America. The varves are from glacial Lake Agassiz (central North America). The chronology is pinned on accelerator mass spectrometry radiocarbon-dated terrestrial macrofossils at the base of a widespread red-clay bed deposited during flooding from the Lake Superior basin. We illustrate the utility of this record by examining ice-margin retreat and melting through the late Younger Dryas and across the Holocene boundary. The ice margin receded at a constant rate, not only during the late YD, but for at least 300 yr after the onset of the Holocene. In contrast, varve thicknesses increased at the boundary, and a moraine formed over a 50 yr period, perhaps in response to the warming climate. Our expectation is that this time series will continue to be developed, expanded, and refined because it promises to be the longest and most geographically extensive glacial varve data set in North America."
1,"Assisted colonisation, one form of species translocation, has been proposed as a tool for helping species to track suitable conditions in a changing climate. There are considerable practical challenges associated with it, including predicting where to place translocated individuals. This problem may be particularly big for small and immobile species, where small-scale microenvironmental conditions de-couple them from environmental conditions as projected in large-scale climate models. 2. To investigate this problem, we developed a survey-based model to predict the occurrence of our target species, the fruticose terricolous arctic-alpine lichen, Flavocetraria nivalis, within the Cairngorm Mountains. 3. We then undertook an experimental translocation of this species. A second model, using variables that were significant in the survey-based model, was only fair at predicting the initial pattern of survival at the recipient site. 4. However, model fit of the translocation survival model improved over time as the distribution of surviving individuals more accurately reflected the distribution of suitable environmental conditions. In addition, model predictive power increased with the addition of data on microclimatic conditions at recipient plots. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our results demonstrate that, for species which respond strongly to local environmental conditions, are immobile and, to some extent, decoupled from larger scale climates, it may be difficult to build a priori accurate predictive models of habitat suitability. In these cases, a combination of modelling and expert judgement, along with the movement of substantial numbers of transplants, may be the appropriate options for maximising the success of assisted colonisation."
1,"Assays for extracellular enzyme activity (EEA) have become a common tool for studying soil microbial responses in climate change experiments. Nevertheless, measures of potential EEA, which are conducted under controlled conditions, often do not account for the direct effects of climate change on EEA that occur as a result of the temperature and moisture dependence of enzyme activity in situ. Likewise, the indirect effects of climate on EEA in the field, that occur via effects on microbial enzyme producers, must be assessed in the context of potential changes in plant and soil faunal communities. Here, EEA responses to warming and altered precipitation in field studies are reviewed, with the goal of evaluating the role of EEA in enhancing our understanding of soil and ecosystem responses to climate change. Seasonal and interannual variation in EEA responses to climate change treatments are examined, and potential interactions with elevated atmospheric CO2, increased atmospheric N deposition and changes in disturbance regimes are also explored. It is demonstrated that in general, soil moisture manipulations in field studies have had a much greater influence on potential EEA than warming treatments. However, these results may simply reflect the low magnitude of soil warming achieved in many field experiments. In addition, changes in plant species composition over the longer term in response to warming could strongly affect EEA. Future challenges involve extending studies of potential EEA to address EEA responses to climate change in situ, and gaining further insights into the mechanisms, such as enzyme production, stabilization and turnover, that underlie EEA responses.

1,"The widespread retreat of mountain glaciers is a striking emblem of recent climate change. Yet mass-balance observations indicate that many glaciers are out of equilibrium with current climate, meaning that observed retreats do not show the full response to warming. This is a fundamental consequence of glacier dynamics: mountain glaciers typically have multidecadal response timescales, and so their response lags centennial-scale climate trends. A substantial difference between transient and equilibrium glacier length persists throughout the warming period; we refer to this length difference as 'disequilibrium'. Forcing idealized glacier geometries with gradual warming shows that the glacier response timescale fundamentally governs the evolution of disequilibrium. Comparing a hierarchy of different glacier models suggests that accurate estimates of ice thickness and climatology, which control the timescale, are more important than higher order ice dynamics for capturing disequilibrium. Current glacier disequilibrium has previously been estimated for a selection of individual glaciers; our idealized modeling shows that sustained disequilibrium is a fundamental response of glacier dynamics, and is robust across a range of glacier geometries. This implies that many mountain glaciers are committed to additional, kilometer-scale retreats, even without further warming. Disequilibrium must also be addressed when calibrating glacier models used for climate reconstructions and projections of retreat in response to future warming."
1,"Managed re-alignment of sea defences is seen as the way to strengthen these by rationalising the line between land and sea and creating a buffer of inter-tidal habitat in front of them. This buffer is most commonly salt marsh which absorbs wave energy thus protecting the defences. The global area of salt marsh is in decline due to a range of issues and managed re-alignment is a way of creating or recreating this important habitat. This review examines managed re-alignment schemes in the light of salt marsh loss, rising sea levels and a changing climate. The ecosystem services and benefits provided by salt marsh can be assessed and given a monetary value. Managed re-alignment can be an important tool for salt marsh creation and coastal zone management. The number and size of schemes in the UK has increased in recent years but the area of recreated salt marsh is still insufficient to replace that lost by erosion and other processes. Background data from a proposed site, and adjacent areas likely to be affected, need to be collected prior to embarking on a scheme that may prove successful. Stakeholder interests cannot be neglected and there will also be a need for long-term monitoring. Re-created salt marshes may form an effective sea defence buffer but they remain significantly different from adjacent natural marshes for many years both in their vegetation and functional equivalence."
1,"Toxic cyanobacterial blooms are a water quality issue worldwide whose incidence and severity are predicted to increase due to climate change and eutrophication. Argentina is not an exception to this trend, since those massive proliferations have increased in the last two decades as a consequence of water quality changes due to human activities. This work presents a thorough search and analysis of published literature on the occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms and cyanotoxins in Argentina. We retrieved 241 bloom events (1944-2014) covering 63 impacted water bodies, used either for recreational activities and/or drinking water supply. The highest incidence was concentrated in the central and eastern areas of the country (Chaco-Pampean Plain and Peripampean Sierras), the most densely populated regions, also highly impacted by agro-industrial activities. Intense blooms of Microcystis, Dolichospermum and Cylindrospermopsis species represent a potential hazard for both human beings and wild-life through oral ingestion and/or direct contact, although quantitative and systematic registers to estimate the extent of occurrence are still missing. Elevated microcystins concentrations, together with the presence of blooms of potential saxitoxin or anatoxin-a producers emphasize the need to increase monitoring of these toxins in drinking water supplies and recreational areas. The data presented are valuable for promoting the generation and implementation of guideline values and risk management frameworks at a national and regional scale."
1,"Global warming and nitrogen (N) deposition have an important influence on terrestrial ecosystems; however, the influence of warming and N deposition on plant photosynthetic products and nutrient cycling in plants is not well understood. We examined the effects of 3 years of warming and N addition on the plant photosynthetic products, foliar chemistry and stoichiometric ratios of two dominant species, i.e., Leymus chinensis and Phragmites communis, in a temperate meadow in northeastern China. Warming significantly increased the chlorophyll content and soluble sugars in L. chinensis but had no impact on the carotenoid and fructose contents. N addition caused a significant increase in the carotenoid and fructose contents. Warming and N addition had little impact on the photosynthetic products of P. communis. Warming caused significant decreases in the N and phosphorus (P) concentrations and significantly increased the carbon (C):P and N:P ratios of L. chinensis, but not the C concentration or the C:N ratio. N addition significantly increased the N concentration, C:P and N:P ratios, but significantly reduced the C:N ratio of L. chinensis. Warming significantly increased P. communis C and P concentrations, and the C:N and C:P ratios, whereas N addition increased the C, N and P concentrations but had no impact on the stoichiometric variables. This study suggests that both warming and N addition have direct impacts on plant photosynthates and elemental stoichiometry, which may play a vital role in plant-mediated biogeochemical cycling in temperate meadow ecosystems."
0,"Filter feeding invertebrates are a relevant component of fouling assemblages with a pivotal role in ecological processes, since they improve water quality, enhance habitat heterogeneity and transfer organic matter from the water column to the benthos. They modulate the availability of resources to other species, with effects on the density and behavior of the surrounding macrofauna. The fanworm Sabella spallanzanii, one of the largest and most abundant Mediterranean filter feeders, provides a shelter for predation and a secondary substrate for algae and settlement for sessile invertebrates. We tested its role in driving the structure of fouling assemblages, through a removal experiment. The experiment was one-year-long, with four sampling times. The effect of the removal on the fouling community was marginal in terms of species richness and evenness, while the biomass showed important differences, with a constant increase over time with higher values in the samples containing S. spallanzanii. At the end of observations, the biomass reached the value of 3917 g DW m(-2) in controls and 2073 g DW m(-2) in treatments. The empty space left by fanworms was not used by other species with similar biomasses. It is possible that the functioning of fouling communities may, in the event of loss of species, fluctuate in terms of biomass mobilization to different compartments, either towards the pelagic compartment or to the detritus chain. In systems with reduced water turnover, this by-pass can have important consequences in terms of stability and ecological balance."
0,"Implementing sustainable crop protection practices is crucial to protect global harvests and ensure high-quality food supplies. While priming is an established method in seed production for the fortification of plants against various stresses, it is not yet a standard practice in transplant cultivation. Thus, we evaluated the long-term effects of thermopriming-a heat-based priming technique-on the growth, development, and fruit yield of tomato plants. Following a recovery period of about six weeks for thermoprimed plants without stress inducers, we subjected them to subsequent salt stress to ascertain the persistence of the priming effects. Additionally, we compared the efficacy of thermopriming with benzothiadiazole (BTH), a chemical elicitor, in enhancing plant resilience to abiotic stress. While BTH application negatively impacted both plant growth and fruit health, thermopriming showed no such adverse effects on these parameters. Instead, thermopriming initially enhanced the plant defense mechanisms by increasing the accumulation of protective phenols and flavonoids in the leaves. Interestingly, while thermopriming did not alter the response to salt stress, it notably strengthened the overall resilience of the plants. Our findings underscore both the potential and temporal constraints of thermopriming memory. Nonetheless, primed plants exhibited temporarily increased stress tolerance, offering a means to safeguard the offspring."
1,"Chemical pollutants and/or climate change have the potential to break down reproductive barriers between species and facilitate hybridization. Hybrid zones may arise in response to environmental gradients and secondary contact between formerly allopatric populations, or due to the introduction of non-native species. In freshwater ecosystems, field observations indicate that changes in water quality and chemistry, due to pollution and climate change, are correlated with an increased frequency of hybridization. Physical and chemical disturbances of water quality can alter the sensory environment, thereby affecting chemical and visual communication among fish. Moreover, multiple chemical compounds (e.g. pharmaceuticals, metals, pesticides, and industrial contaminants) may impair fish physiology, potentially affecting phenotypic traits relevant for mate selection (e.g. pheromone production, courtship, and coloration). Although warming waters have led to documented range shifts, and chemical pollution is ubiquitous in freshwater ecosystems, few studies have tested hypotheses about how these stressors may facilitate hybridization and what this means for biodiversity and species conservation. Through a systematic literature review across disciplines (i.e. ecotoxicology and evolutionary biology), we evaluate the biological interactions, toxic mechanisms, and roles of physical and chemical environmental stressors (i.e. chemical pollution and climate change) in disrupting mate preferences and inducing interspecific hybridization in freshwater fish. Our study indicates that climate change-driven changes in water quality and chemical pollution may impact visual and chemical communication crucial for mate choice and thus could facilitate hybridization among fishes in freshwater ecosystems. To inform future studies and conservation management, we emphasize the importance of further research to identify the chemical and physical stressors affecting mate choice, understand the mechanisms behind these interactions, determine the concentrations at which they occur, and assess their impact on individuals, populations, species, and biological diversity in the Anthropocene."
1,"Extreme floods seriously affect the biodiversity of terrestrial animals (birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, and insects). The degree of impact depends on many factors, e.g., animal characteristics, natural conditions, and flood characteristics. Previous evaluation methods are not suitable for assessing the impact of floods on the biodiversity of all species in the entire submerged area, nor do they accurately reflect variability in the degree of impact. First, the influencing factors were boiled down to four: ratio of flood duration to survival time of animals in floods (D), ratio of flood depth to plant height (S), migration ability of animals (M), and temperature (T), which are repre-sented by a coefficient I. Then, we proposed a calculation method for I based on the four factors. Third, we pro-posed the total and average biodiversity impact indices, namely, the TBI and ABI, respectively, indicating the overall and average impacts of floods on biodiversity in the submerged area, with the calculation method consid-ering both the number of species and I. An extreme flood was simulated to obtain the flood parameters. In addi-tion, we analyzed monthly changes in partial influencing factors. Finally, the impact of extreme floods on the biodiversity of terrestrial animals in the submerged area was evaluated monthly, and it was found that (1) TBI and ABI changed with space; (2) the ABI of different animals in descending order were mammals, insects, reptiles, amphibians, and birds; (3) the ABI of different land use types in descending order were cropland, orchard and shrubland, grassland, and forest and for TBI were orchard and shrubland, cropland, forest, and grassland; and (4) the TBI and ABI of different animals and land use types changed over time. The proposed method and indices are suitable for assessing the impact of floods on the biodiversity of any organism in any area. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
1,"As a fundamental natural resource and a strategic economic resource, water resources play a key supporting role in the process of social and economic development. In this paper, risk factors influencing the water resources carrying capacity (WRCC) were investigated based on risk theory and resources carrying capacity theory, and a method for the risk assessment of the WRCC was proposed. The vulnerability of WRCC system was evaluated by using the Fuzzy Comprehensive Evaluation method, the hazard of WRCC system was calculated by using the comprehensive hazard index, and then the risk of WRCC was obtained by combining the vulnerability with the hazard. The risk of WRCC in China due to climate change, urbanization, and industrialization was thoroughly investigated. The results demonstrated that the risk of WRCC was higher in Northern China than in Southern China and was higher in developed areas than in developing areas. The risk was observed to be highest in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. Meanwhile, the results also suggested that the risk of WRCC can be reduced in two ways: (1) Reducing the pressure on the water resources carrying system caused by economic and social activities; and (2) increasing the water resources supply in certain areas. The risk assessment of the WRCC presented here provides a valuable reference for the management and sustainable utilization of water resources in China."
1,"Invasive species can significantly affect native species when their niches are similar. Ecological and morphological similarities between the invasive Australian palm, Archontophoenix cunninghamiana, and the native palm from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, Euterpe edulis, suggest that they have similar environmental requirements and functional roles (i.e., the function a species performs in an ecosystem). This similarity raises concerns about how the invasive palm could impact the native species in the present and future. We used spatial (species occurrences) and ecological information (frugivory events) to characterize the environmental niche and functional role of the two palms and assess their overlap. In addition, we predicted the potential area of occurrence of each palm within the Brazilian Atlantic Forest under current and future climate conditions.We estimated the environmental conditions used by the invasive plant based on its native distribution only, and based on all areas where the species is able to establish across the globe. We found that the environmental niches of the two palm species overlap up to 39%, which corresponds to 50% of the current geographic distribution of E. edulis in the Atlantic Forest. In the areas where the two species potentially co-occur, the impact of the invasive species on the native should be influenced by the invasive species interactions with frugivores. We found that the frugivory functional role of the two palms was similar (84% overlap) which suggest that A. cunninghamiana might disrupt the seed dispersal of the native palm. However, co-occurrence between the palms may decline with future climate change, as the potentially environmental suitable area for the invasive palm is predicted to decline by 10% to 55%. Evaluating the similarity in both the environmental niche, of the native and global extent, and the functional role of native and invasive plants provides a detailed understanding of the potential impact of invasive species on native species now and in the future."
1,"In recent decades, human-induced climate change has caused a worldwide increase in the frequency/intensity/duration of extreme events, resulting in enormous disruptions to life and property. Hence, a comprehensive understanding of global-scale spatiotemporal trends and variability of extreme events at different intensity levels (e.g., moderate/severe/extreme) and durations (e.g., short-term/long-term) of normal, dry and wet conditions is essential in predicting/forecasting/mitigating future extreme events. This article analyses these aspects using estimates of a non-stationary standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index corresponding to different accumulation periods for 0.5 degrees resolution CRU grids at globe-scale. Results are analyzed with respect to changes in land-use/landcover and geographic/location indicators (latitude, longitude, elevation) at different time scales (decadal/annual/seasonal/monthly) for each continent. The analysis showed an (i) increasing trend in the frequency/count of both dry and wet conditions and variability of dry conditions, and (ii) contrasting (decreasing) trend in the variability of wet conditions, possibly due to climate change-induced variations in atmospheric circulations. Globally, the highest variability in the wet and dry conditions is found during the Northern hemisphere's winter season. The decadal-scale analysis showed that change in variability in dry and wet conditions has been predominant since the 1930s and 1950s, respectively and is found to be increasing in recent decades."
1,"The air pollution control and evaluation has acquired high importance in the modern world. Depending on the per-manence of the pollutants in the atmosphere, the pollution could be local, regional or global. The contribution of many developing countries, such as Cuba, to global climate change is very low. In these cases, while providing importance to reducing national emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG), the priority actions would be addressed to adapting to climate change and to reducing emissions that determine local and regional pollution, which have adverse effects, especially on health. The present paper examines Cuba's contribution to global greenhouse gases emissions, which turns out to be modest. Then, the problem of local pollution in the nation is addressed, reporting data from experimental measurements and comparing them with national regulations. The methodology employed and the results obtained on the levels of pollution generated by the national energy sector and corresponding impacts on health and its costs are discussed. The work may provide support for decision makers on the priorities in the use of available resources, with the aim of environmental preservation. Some approaches about how to deal the right balance of local and global responsibilities for countries as Cuba, are also presented. As the development of those countries proceeds, their contribution to GHG emissions is expected to become more relevant. Some planned countermeasures for reducing such a trend are illustrated."
1,"Spatial assessments of historical climate change provide information that can be used by scientists to analyze climate variation over time and evaluate, for example, its effects on biodiversity, in order to focus their research and conservation efforts. Despite the fact that there are global climatic databases available at high spatial resolution, they represent a short temporal window that impedes evaluating historical changes of climate and their impacts on biodiversity. To fill this gap, we developed climate gridded surfaces for Mexico for three periods that cover most of the 20(th)and early 21(st)centuries:t(1)-1940 (1910-1949),t(2)-1970 (1950-1979) andt(3)-2000 (1980-2009), and used these interpolated surfaces to describe how climate has changed over time, both countrywide and in its 19 biogeographic provinces. Results from our characterization of climate change indicate that the mean annual temperature has increased by nearly 0.2 degrees C on average across the whole country fromt(2)-1970 tot(3)-2000. However, changes have not been spatially uniform: Nearctic provinces in the north have suffered higher temperature increases than southern tropical regions. Central and southern provinces cooled at the beginning of the 20(th)century but warmed consistently since the 1970s. Precipitation increased betweent(1)-1940 andt(2)-1970 across the country, more notably in the northern provinces, and it decreased betweent(2)-1970 andt(3)-2000 in most of the country. Results on the historical climate conditions in Mexico may be useful for climate change analyses for both environmental and social sciences. Nonetheless, our climatology was based on information from climate stations for which 9.4-36.2% presented inhomogeneities over time probably owing to non-climatic factors, and climate station density changed over time. Therefore, the estimated changes observed in our analysis need to be interpreted cautiously."
1,"Over the few past decades, many bird species have expanded their nesting ranges by adapting to degraded habitat. Conservation efforts have promoted the growth of populations of endangered species, and the ranges of several such species have expanded continuously. Understanding and predicting the effects of climate change on the nesting habitat ranges of endangered species can aid species recovery and habitat management. In this study, we used multi-scale data and geographic variables with a field survey of sites occurrence of Oriental Storks (Ciconia boyciana) to determine their nest selection patterns. We then simulated currently potential habitats and predicted spatio-temporal dynamics changes in their suitable nesting areas under future carbon emission scenarios in China. Our results show that Oriental Storks prefer nesting at low altitudes in flat areas near rivers. The Sanjiang Plain, the western part of Northeast China, Bohai Bay, and the middle and lower Yangtze River floodplain were the areas with potentially suitable nesting areas for Oriental Storks. We predicted that the nesting ranges of Oriental Storks will expand under two Representative Concentration Pathway scenarios (RCPs) in the future. However, under the most conservative (RCP2.6) and worst-case scenarios (RCP8.5), the rate of gain in suitable habitat will decrease, and the loss rate will increase. Change in the area of suitable nesting habitat varied among regions. The loss rate of suitable habitat in the middle and lower Yangtze River floodplain was predicted to decrease in the future, and the gain rate in the area of suitable habitat was predicted to be relatively stable and showed an increase. Some measures that could be taken to enhance the breeding habitat of Oriental Storks include identifying conservation gap areas and minimizing the loss rate of suitable habitat. Finally, scientific planning and management of potentially suitable habitats in protected areas and protected networks are needed to ensure the persistence of breeding Oriental Storks."
1,"A key skill that geomorphologists possess is the ability to use multi-scale perspectives in their interpretations of landscapes. One way to gain these perspectives is with the use of nested hierarchical frameworks. In fluvial geomorphology, such frameworks help with assessment of large-scale controls (e.g., tectonic activity, climate change) on the pattern and dynamics of smaller-scale physical features (e.g., channels, floodplains, bars), and conversely illustrate how these smaller-scale features provide the building blocks from which to make interpretations of fluvial processes and dynamics over larger spatial and temporal scales. Given the rapid pace of technological developments, the range of relatively inexpensive tools available for visualising and mapping landscapes at different spatial scales is expanding exponentially. In this paper, which focuses on the World Heritage-listed Okavango Delta in Botswana, we demonstrate how various visualisations generated by different technologies at different spatial scales (catchment, landscape unit, reach, site and geomorphic unit) are providing critical baseline information to enhance interpretation and communication of fluvial geomorphology, with potential application in water resources management. In particular, our nested hierarchical approach could be used as an interactive communication tool for non-specialists and embedded within existing and future management plans for the Delta. The construction of nested hierarchies that synthesise information and analyses can be a valuable addition to the environmental manager's toolkit."
1,"Soil salinization is a complex process resulting from the interaction of several factors, mainly quality of water used for irrigation, which deteriorates by aquifer overexploitation, and changes in rainfall patterns and aquifer recharge related to climate change. The purpose of this paper is to present a method to assess the variations of groundwater quality, to compare its suitability for irrigation and to decipher the possible causes of soil salinity in Tierra Nueva, San Luis Potos, Mexico. To assess salinization related to irrigation water quality, dissolved anions and cations were measured in surface and groundwater samples; the most widely used water quality indices to evaluate potential salinity risk of soils are Residual Sodium Carbonate (RSC) and Sodium Adsorption Ratio (SAR). In view of the limited number and uncertainty of using only two indices, in the present work a novel water quality assessment was applied for the first time by statistically combining eight individual quality indices: (RSC), (SAR), percentage of sodium (% Na), Kelley ratio (KR), permeability index (PI), soluble sodium percentage (SSP), magnesium adsorption ratio (MAR) and cation ratio of structural stability (CROSS). A factorial variance analysis and principal component analysis of these eight indices were performed to identify linearity and maximum variance. All irrigation water tests show dissolved ions that can easily precipitate as indicated by PI. In cropland, % Na, SSP, RSC, KR and PI had values unsuitable for irrigation, while RAS, CROSS and MAR values are within suitable levels. The main mechanism of soil salinization seems to be the cation exchange of Ca2+ to Na+ in the waters, along with the precipitation of natrite (Na2CO3) promoted by shallow groundwater and semi-desert conditions of the region. The population growth in the region has caused further demand of clean water for human consumption, affecting the water availability from the aquifer of the study zone, worsened by drought associated to climate change."
1,"With climate change and rising sea levels, the residents and assets in low-elevation coastal zones (LECZ) are at increasing risk. The application of high-resolution gridded population datasets in recent years has highlighted the threats faced by people living in LECZ. However, the potential exposure of gross domestic product (GDP) within LECZ remains unknown, due to the absence of refined GDP datasets and corresponding analyzes for coastal regions. The climate-related risks faced by LECZ may still be underestimated. In this study, we estimated the potential exposure of GDP in the LECZ across China by overlying DEM with new gridded GDP datasets generated by random forest models. The results show that 24.02% and 22.7% of China's total GDP were located in the LECZ in 2010 and 2019, respectively, while the area of the LECZ only accounted for 1.91% of China's territory. Significant variability appears in the spatial-temporal pattern and the volume of GDP across sectors, which impedes disaster prevention and mitigation efforts within administrative regions. Interannual comparisons reveal a rapid increase in GDP within the LECZ, but a decline in its share of the country. Policy reasons may have driven the slow shift of China's economy to regions far from the LECZ."
1,"This paper presents a detailed estimation of methane emissions from ruminant animals, livestock manure, and rice cultivation in China as of 1990. To estimate methane emissions from ruminants in China, emission factors were developed based on China-specific feed energy systems and production characteristics for representative animal types; emissions were estimated to be about 5.796 teragrams (Tg), approximately 7.2% of global methane from animals in 1990. Emission factors for livestock manure were developed based on the method recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the types of manure management systems used, and regional climate characteristics in China. Livestock and poultry manure in China were estimated to account for about 1.249 Tg of methane emissions or about 5% of global emissions from livestock manure in 1990; of this amount, swine manure accounted for approximately 82%. Based on the rice cultivation regions, planting patterns, area of land cultivated, field-flooding patterns, and emission rates, methane emissions from rice fields in China were estimated to be 9.189 Tg."
1,"The increasingly urgent reform of water allocation is challenged by the complexity of the political dimension, in particular the need to reconcile often competing objectives such as food and energy security and green growth. Moreover, these objectives are unstable, and allocation regimes have to adjust to shifting priorities and circumstances at the lowest cost to society. Climate change generates additional uncertainty in water availability and demand. This calls for robust allocation regimes that can adjust, reallocate and reduce water allocation in an organized way."
1,"Portugal (Southwestern Europe) experiences a high incidence of dry hazards such as drought, a phenomenon that entails a notable burden of morbidity and mortality worldwide. For the first time in the Lisbon district, a time-series study was conducted to evaluate the impact of drought measured by the Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI) and Standardised Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) on the daily natural, circulatory, and respiratory mortality from 1983 to 2016. An assessment by gender and adult age population groups (45-64, 65-74, >= 75 years old) was included. To estimate the relative risks and attributable risks, generalised linear models with a Poisson link were used. Additionally, the influence of heatwaves and atmospheric pollution for the period from 2007 to 2016 (available period for pollution data) was considered. The main findings indicate statistically significant associations between drought conditions and all analysed causes of mortality. Moreover, SPEI shows an improved capability to reflect the different risks. People in the 45-64 year-old group did not indicate any significant influence in any of the cases, whereas the oldest groups had the highest risk. The drought effects on mortality among the population varied across the different study periods, and in general, the men population was affected more than the women population (except for the SPEI and circulatory mortality during the long study period). The short-term influence of droughts on mortality could be explained primarily by the effect of heatwaves and pollution; however, when both gender and age were considered in the Poisson models, the effect of drought also remained statistically significant when all climatic phenomena were included for specific groups of the total population and men. This type of study facilitates a better understanding of the population at risk and allows the development of more effective measures to mitigate the drought effects on the population.

1,"For over 150 years, Indo-Pacific species have been colonizing the Mediterranean Sea via the Suez Canal, with increasing ecological and socioeconomic impacts. Using an ensemble of species distribution models and ten invasive fish species as a case study, we demonstrate that warming conditions are now weakening the climatic barriers that historically prevented these species from expanding further and moving into the Atlantic Ocean. On the basis of our analysis, we discuss the prospect for studying an underappreciated large-scale process: namely, the evolution of a novel unidirectional faunal interchange between two distant oceans."
1,"Unrelenting poaching to feed the illegal trafficking of rhinoceros (rhino) horn remains the principle threat to the persistence of south-central black and southern white rhino that live in the Kruger National Park (Kruger), South Africa. Other global environmental change drivers, such as unpredictable climatic conditions, impose additional uncertainties on the management and persistence of these species. The drought experienced in Kruger over the 2015/2016 rainy season may have affected rhino population growth and thus added an additional population pressure to the poaching pressure already occurring. Under drought conditions, reduced grass biomass predicts increased natural deaths and a subsequent decrease in birth rate for the grazing white rhino. Such variance in natural death and birth rates for the browsing black rhino are not expected under these conditions. We evaluated these predictions using rhino population survey data from 2013 to 2017. Comparisons of natural deaths and birth rates between pre-(2013/2014 and 2014/15), during(2015/2016) and post-drought (2016/2017) periods in Kruger showed increased natural mortality and decreased births for white rhino, but no significant changes for black rhino, supporting our predictions. As a result, despite reduced poaching rates, the total mortality rate of white rhino remains significantly higher than the birth rate. Decreased poaching, decreased natural deaths and no apparent drought effects in black rhino resulted in a lower total mortality rate than the estimated birth rate in 2017. Active biological management and traditional anti-poaching initiatives together therefore represent the most likely way to buffer the impacts of decreased population growth through climate change and wildlife crime on the persistence of rhinos."
1,"Background: Limitations to plant growth imposed by the Mediterranean climate are mainly due to carbon balance in response to stress factors. In particular, water stress associated to high air temperature and irradiance in summer causes a marked decrease in CO2 assimilation. Air temperature sensitivity of photosynthesis (P-N) differs from that of leaf respiration (R-D). P-N often decreases sharply at temperature above its optimum while R-D increases exponentially over short term rises in temperature. Nevertheless, the impact of water deficit on R-D is still far from clear with reports in literature including decreases, maintenance or increases in its rates. The ratio R-D/P-N can be considered a simple approach to leaf carbon balance because it indicates the percentage of photosynthates that is respired. Results: The results underline different morphological, anatomical and physiological traits of the evergreen species co-occurring in the Mediterranean maquis which are indicative of their adaptive capability to Mediterranean stress factors. The ratio R-D/P-N varies from 0.15 +/- 0.04 in autumn, 0.24 +/- 0.05 in spring through 0.29 +/- 0.15 in winter to 0.46 +/- 0.11 in summer. The lower R-D/P-N in autumn and spring underlines the highest P-N rates during the favorable periods when resources are not limited and leaves take in roughly three to five times more CO2 than they lose by respiration. On the contrary, the highest R-D/P-N ratio in summer underlines the lowest sensitivity of respiration to drought. Among the considered species, Quercus ilex and Pistacia lentiscus have the largest tolerance to low winter temperatures while Phillyrea latifolia and Myrtus communis to drought, and Phillyrea latifolia the highest recovery capability after the first rainfall following drought. Conclusions: The Mediterranean evergreen specie shows a different tolerance to Mediterranean climate stress factors. The predicted global warming might differently affect carbon balance of the considered species, with a possible change in Mediterranean shrublands composition in the long-term. Understanding the carbon balance of plants in water limited environments is crucial in order to make informed land management decisions. Moreover, our results underline the importance of including seasonal variations of photosynthesis and respiration in carbon balance models."
1,"A decline in tree growth has occurred in numerous regions over recent decades and is associated with enhanced water deficits driven by climate warming. This phenomenon may be more noticeable at lower latitudes with higher temperatures. However, the process by which these elevated temperatures alter growth performance is not well understood. In this study, by combining tree-ring data (including 340 increment cores) and remotely sensed vegetation index data, we investigated the long-term growth performance of Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica Litv. (Mongolian pine), an important species for afforestation in northern China, in response to environmental factors in an area of introduction (lower latitude) and its native range (higher latitude). More notable decreases in both tree-ring width index (RWI) and basal area increment at breast height coincided with lower values and larger variations in the satellite-derived vegetation index in the area of introduction. The RWI showed stronger negative correlations with temperature and positive correlations with the self-calibrating Palmer drought severity index during most months in the introduction area. These results indicate that enhanced drought stress caused by elevated temperatures in lower latitudes might be a key factor for the growth decline in Mongolian pine plantations. The negative impact of increased temperatures on tree growth through exacerbating drought stress at lower latitudes with water deficit highlights the need to reduce water stress in forest management in such areas under climate warming-driven aridification."
1,"In this study, the intensities of droughts and floods in three provinces of China are projected using three approaches: wavelet analysis, auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models, and random tree (RT) models based on a 500-year time series. The motivation for this work was the observation that drought/flood intensities are generally increasing, the prediction of drought/flood intensities for the next 50 years, along with their future spatiotemporal patterns. Based on the three approaches, with few exceptions, the results reveal a likely increasing trend for both droughts and floods, with higher intensity under the RCP8.5 scenario for droughts and the RCP4.5 scenario for floods by the year 2050. Notwithstanding this worsening trend, it was found that drought/flood intensities for most regions are projected to neither entirely increase nor entirely decrease in the near future. Drought and flood intensities may alternatively occur on a multi-year or a decadal timescale. Inner Mongolia, located in an arid temperate climate zone, is projected to experience a higher average disaster intensity, followed by the warm monsoon region of Henan, while the humid subtropical region of Guizhou is projected to be the least affected, with high spatial heterogeneity within each region. Climate variation, particularly temperature range and deviation across either the coldest or wettest months, was closely associated with drought/flood intensities. We conclude that the major challenge for drought/flood prediction is not the general change trends or their responses to climate change, but the spatiotemporal heterogeneity at multiple scales."
1,"The island of Cuba and surrounding cays are a major repository of biodiversity in the Caribbean archipelago. Although Cuba is widely recognized for its high biodiversity and endemism, much, of the country's conservation experiences have been overlooked by the global conservation scientific community. Here we particularly highlight decades of governance efforts that built and strengthened forest and biodiversity protection policies, resulting in the second largest rate of forest cover recovery worldwide, doubling of both marine and terrestrial protected area networks in recent years, as well as developing a unique agroecological matrix management. These conservation strategies combined with the constraints on infrastructure development as a result of the decades long U.S. embargo, has had the indirect result of placing Cuba in a unique position in the Caribbean region. Nevertheless, despite these advances, significant part of the Cuban biota suffers from deforestation and habitat degradation. Major threats include booming tourism, spread of introduced species, climate change and increasing frequency and intensity of storms and hurricanes associated to global warming. We also point out for Cuba's future challenges, as well as lessons that could be applied in other tropical countries."
1,"This study developed a Reliability-Resiliency-Vulnerability (R-R-V) approach that aggregates the frequency, duration, and severity of droughts estimated using the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). This approach was used to analyze the characteristics of droughts for the current (1976-2005) and the future (2010-2099) climates. The future climate data obtained from 28 general circulation models (GCMs) of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) was divided into three general periods: Future 1: 2010-2039, Future 2: 2040-2069; and Future 3: 2070-2099. As a result, aggregation R-R-V representing water availability would increase during Future 1, and then gradually decrease until the end of the century. The frequencies of future drought events for Future 2 and Future 3 were similar to the current frequency, while the durations will be longer and the severity will be higher at most locations during Future 3. Thus, the mean of R-R-V over South Korea is expected to decrease, except for Future 1, and the spatial variability of R-R-V is expected to increase. In the end, the changes in the mean and variance of rainfall and temperature would lead to a decrease in the mean and increase in the spatial variation of sustainability in South Korea. This approach and its results can be used to establish a long-term drought strategy for regions where the risk of future drought is expected to increase."
1,"The composition and dynamics of plankton communities are critically affected by human-induced environmental changes. We analysed 33 years of phytoplankton monthly data collected in Lake Zurich (Switzerland), assigning organisms (genus level) to taxonomic groups (class, family), Reynolds associations and size categories. The aim was to understand how eutrophication and climate change have influenced taxa co-occurrence patterns within and between groups over the lake water column (14 depths, 0-135 m), using null-models to test for non-random spatial (depth) assembly. We found that the whole community showed high taxa co-occurrence levels, significantly deviating over time from random assembly concurrently with lake warming and reduced nutrient loading. This pattern was driven mostly by the depth structure of metalimnetic assemblages during summer and autumn. The prevalence of non-random spatial patterns changed for different taxonomic and functional groups, with only few significant deviations from null-model expectations. Within taxonomic and functional groups (particularly Classes and size categories), the frequency of spatial overdispersion of taxa decreased over time while the frequency of clustering increased. Our data suggest that the relative importance of mechanisms determining phytoplankton metacommunity dynamics have changed along with environmental gradients shaping water column structure."
1,"Drought is endemic to the North American Great Plains, causing severe economic consequences. However, instrumental climate data only exist from ca AD 1890, and limited tree-ring, paleolimnological, archeological and eolian records document the last two millennia. To address this lack of monitoring and paleoclimatic data, the pollen preserved in the varved sediments of Lake Mina, Minnesota, on the northeastern border of the Great Plains, were analyzed. May and February mean monthly temperatures and annual precipitation minus potential evapotranspiration were reconstructed at a 4-year resolution using a pre-settlement pollen-climate calibration set. The period of the so-called Little Ice Age (LIA) (AD 1500-1870) was colder than the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) (AD 1100-1500) in west-central Minnesota. Winter temperatures in the LIA declined more than summer ones. The pollen record suggests that the LIA occurred in three phases: an initial cold phase from AD 1505 to AD 1575, a warmer phase, and then a very cold phase from AD 1625 to AD 1775. There were severe droughts detected in the Lake Mina record from AD 1660 to AD 1710 and AD 1300 to AD 1400, suggesting that high-resolution pollen records can detect events previously defined from the tree-ring records. This latter century-scale drought is concurrent with the widely reported AD 1250-1400 mega-drought, which exceeds the severity of 20th century droughts. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
1,"Knowledge production within the climate sciences is quickly taken up by multiple stakeholders, reproduced in scientific citation and the broader culture, even when it is no longer accurate. This article accomplishes two goals: firstly, it contributes to the clarification of the quantification of emissions from animal agriculture, and secondly, it considers why the dominant framing of the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) on this subject focuses on maximizing production efficiency. Specifically, analysing the FAO's own work on this topic shows that the often-used FAO estimate that emissions from animal agriculture amount to 14.5% of all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is now out of date. In returning to the FAO's own explanation of its data sources and its more recent analysis of emissions from animal agriculture, this article finds that the figure of minimum estimate should be updated to 16.5%. The tendency of the FAO to prioritize a technological approach focused on making animal production more eco-efficient is critically examined in light of many other evidence-based calls for reductions in animal consumption. An explanation for this FAO approach is offered in terms of a type of epistemological bias."
1,"Objective: To investigate the resource efficiency and environmental impacts of producing one kilogram of edible protein from two plant- and three animal-protein sources. Design: Primary source data were collected and applied to commodity production statistics to calculate the indices required to compare the environmental impact of producing 1 kg of edible protein from kidney beans, almonds, eggs, chicken and beef. Inputs included land and water for raising animals and growing animal feed, total fuel, and total fertilizer and pesticide for growing the plant commodities and animal feed. Animal waste generated was computed for the animal commodities. Setting: Desk-based study at the Department of Nutrition and Department of Occupational and Environmental Health, Loma Linda University. Subjects: None. Results: To produce 1 kg of protein from kidney beans required approximately eighteen times less land, ten times less water, nine times less fuel, twelve times less fertilizer and ten times less pesticide in comparison to producing 1 kg of protein from beef. Compared with producing 1 kg of protein from chicken and eggs, beef generated five to six times more waste (manure) to produce 1 kg of protein. Conclusions: The substitution of beef with beans in meal patterns will significantly reduce the environmental footprint worldwide and should also be encouraged to reduce the prevalence of non-communicable chronic diseases. Societies must work together to change the perception that red meat (e.g. beef) is the mainstay of an affluent and healthy diet."
1,"Many underutilized edible fruit species (UEFS) are found in the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP), which support food security (FS) for both indigenous people and other dependent communities. Unfortunately, there is little study and fragmented information available about these naturally edible products. The UEFS of the IGP was the subject of a systematic review utilizing the PRISMA protocol, which produced implications for FS and land degradation neutrality (LDN). This review aims to survey, summarize, and annotate the published information about the angiosperms native and naturalized UEFS of IGP to identify and make use of this species, particularly for the sustainable development of this region. A systematic review confirmed that 371 species of UEFS, of which 62 species were threatened and near threatened (TNT)-UEFS. Among the TNT-UEFS, 41 species were threatened, while 21 species were NT. The threatened species were further categorized as per the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List in the IGP as vulnerable (21 species), endangered (16 species), and critically endangered (four species). This systematic review suggests integration of the native and naturalized UEFS in afforestation and reforestation programs to aid in various ecosystem services. Calamus inermis, Corypha taliera , Licuala peltata, and Saurauia punduana are examples of multipurpose species that require immediate sustainable conservation and cultivation initiatives to save them from extinction in the near future. Multipurpose species such as Aegle marmelos , Buchanania lanzan , Manilkara hexandra , Syzygium cuminii , Tamarindus indica are immensely constructive and climate-smart by surviving in harsh agroclimatic conditions and have great potential for establishment on marginal and wastelands throughout the IGP region. These resilient fruit species enhance biodiversity, ecosystems, and landscapes in addition to providing food for humans. It progressively advances Indi & aacute;s commitment to LDN, combating climate change, and achieving the UN-SDGs, which call for reducing hunger and raising FS by 2030. As a result, the study will offer baseline data for the next investigations and be helpful to policymakers in creating sustainable and scientific policies for the IGP."
0,"This study examines the effect of energy resources on the chances for militarized conflict, water related conflict and cooperation events, and cooperative river treaties between pairs of states on shared international river basins. We examine trade-offs that riparian states can make between energy resources such as oil or natural gas and fresh water resources. Integrating upstream and downstream states' geographical position in a river basin with energy resource information, we examine four related scenarios of states sharing rivers: (1) Joint energy where both upstream and downstream countries have energy resources, (2) Downstream energy where only the downstream state has energy resources, (3) Upstream energy where only an upstream country has energy resources, and (4) No energy. Theoretically, we argue that Downstream energy dyads are most likely to find cooperative solutions to conflicts over shared river resources because downstream states can offer oil and natural gas side payments to upstream states in exchange for greater water supplies. Empirical analyses of dyadic data in shared river basin dyads from 1945 to 2001 provide strong support for the theory. Riparian cooperation through river treaties and diplomacy is best achieved in Downstream energy dyads, where the downstream states have energy resources that can be traded for water resources with upstream states. Militarized conflict and water related conflict events are most likely in Joint energy dyads. Case illustrations from the Aral Sea and Ganges river basins are used to demonstrate the theoretical arguments."
1,"In recent years, increased wildfire activity and climate change have raised concern among scientists and land managers regarding current and future vegetation patterns in post-burn landscapes. We surveyed conifer regeneration 8-15 years after fire in six burn areas in the lower montane zone of the Colorado Front Range. We sampled across a broad range of elevations, aspects, and fire severities and found that densities of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) are generally low, although areas of abundant regeneration do occur. Conifer regeneration was most limited in xeric settings, including more southerly aspects and elevations closer to lower treeline. Additionally, fewer juvenile conifers occurred at greater distances from mature, live trees indicating that seed source as well as topoclimatic setting limits post-fire tree regeneration. Projecting the extent of future forest cover is uncertain due to the possibility of future pulses of tree establishment and unknown depletion rates of existing seedling populations. However, current patterns of post-fire seedling establishment suggest that vegetation composition and structure may differ notably from historic patterns and that lower density stands and even non-forested communities may persist in some areas of these burns long after fire, especially in xeric settings or where no nearby seed source remains."
1,"Environmental archaeology helps researchers understand the correlation between environmental changes and their impacts on human civilization. One such study is taking place along the Wujiang river in Chongqing, China, at and near the Shiniusi site. Moss samples were obtained under natural mountain vegetation, along with soil samples from the QST4 unit at the Shiniusi site and surface soil sites from nearby archeological sites. By combining comprehensive palynology, charcoal, and isotopic chronology analyses with cultural artifacts, and comparing the results with those from adjacent sites, historical insights were obtained. The modern pollen assemblage of the Wujiang comprises mostly monolete spores and tree pollen, with no pollen from the Brassicaceae or rice (Oryza sativa), indicating a lack of human activity. The modern pollen and spore assemblage at nearby sites contains more trilete spores than monolete spores, and increased pollen from the Brassicaceae and Poaceae, indicating increased human activity. From the Shang Dynasty to the Song Dynasty, the pollen and spore assemblage of the QST4 unit was mainly monolete spores and the pollen of trees and herbaceous vegetation, with little pollen of rice and none of the Brassicaceae. Since the Ming Dynasty (1368 to 1644 AD), the pollen and spore assemblage has approached the modern assemblage near the archeological site, with more trilete spores than monolete spores, and increased pollen from the Brassicaceae and Poaceae, indicating greater human activity correlated with cultivation of rice and brassicaceous vegetables. The dominant pollen was from the Brassicaceae, the Poaceae, and the Fabaceae in the CJ unit at the Chenjiazui archeological site from the Zhou Dynasty (1100 to 256 BC) until modern times. High contents of micro-charcoal grains <125 mu m from the Shang and Zhou Dynasties to the Han Dynasty are probably correlated with natural forest fires and climate change, and show reduced human impacts. The increase in micro-charcoal grains >125 mu m since the Tang Dynasty is probably correlated with local grassland burning to fertilize crops. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved."
1,"Over recent decades, palaeolimnological records from remote sites have provided convincing evidence for the onset and development of several facets of global environmental change. Remote lakes, defined here as those occurring in high latitude or high altitude regions, have the advantage of not being overprinted by local anthropogenic processes. As such, many of these sites record broad-scale environmental changes, frequently driven by regime shifts in the Earth system. Here, we review a selection of studies from North America and Europe and discuss their broader implications. The history of investigation has evolved synchronously with the scope and awareness of environmental problems. An initial focus on acid deposition switched to metal and other types of pollutants, then climate change and eventually to atmospheric deposition-fertilising effects. However, none of these topics is independent of the other, and all of them affect ecosystem function and biodiversity in profound ways. Currently, remote lake palaeolimnology is developing unique datasets for each region investigated that benchmark current trends with respect to past, purely natural variability in lake systems. Fostering conceptual and methodological bridges with other environmental disciplines will upturn contribution of remote lake palaeolimnology in solving existing and emerging questions in global change science and planetary stewardship."
1,"Environmental health is not the health of the environment but deals with the impacts of the quality of the environment on public health. The relationships between environmental hazards (physical, chemical, biological) and human diseases are much better revealed, described and quantified and are of major importance. The great advances made in analytical methods prove the great diversity of the chemical dangers to which man is exposed. This confronts the difficulties in measuring the effects in order to quantify the risks. At the international level and in France, the major health organizations have integrated these problems, and national plans on this subject are developed. The major themes of One health and the Exposome measurement are unifying and carrying ambitions. Health warnings are increasing, and citizens are demanding accurate information on the risks to their health. This is why health professionals must become aware of the progress of this issue and for that reason be better trained in the risk assessment associated with environmental exposures. The pressures on the environment, and therefore on humans, associated with climate change, urban growth, air pollution or chemical multiple exposure are some of the significant contributions to diseases that should no longer be ignored.

1,"Indonesia, as a major population in the Asia Pacific region, threatened with food and health insecurity through climate change and rapid economic development, faces the challenge to build capacity among its science-based food and health professionals and institutions. The nutrition research agenda is now being more actively set within the region, rather than by external imposition. A series of papers emanating from a new generation of public health and clinical nutrition scientists is reported in this issue of APJCN. It draws attention to the importance of food patterns and background culture as contributors to the failure of the nutrient rather than a food, food system and socio-ecological approach to solve the region's intransigent nutritionally-related health problems. New understandings of human eco-social biology are providing opportunities to accelerate the resolution of these problems. The challenge is to transform the food-health construct from one which is not sufficiently concerned about the precarious state of ecologically dysfunctional health and its nutrient market drivers to one which strives for more sustainable and affordable solutions. The present reports address a range of options to these ends."
0,"Since the development of the first vaccine against smallpox over two centuries ago, vaccination strategies have been at the forefront of significantly impacting the incidences of infectious diseases globally. However, the increase in the human population, deforestation and climate change, and the rise in worldwide travel have favored the emergence of new viruses with the potential to cause pandemics. The ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is a cruel reminder of the impact of novel pathogens and the suboptimal capabilities of conventional vaccines. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new vaccine strategies that allow the production of billions of doses in a short duration and are broadly protective against emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. Extensive knowledge of the molecular biology and immunology of adenoviruses (Ad) has favored Ad vectors as platforms for vaccine design. The Ad-based vaccine platform represents an attractive strategy as it induces robust humoral and cell-mediated immune responses and can meet the global demand in a pandemic situation. This review describes the status of Ad vector-based vaccines in preclinical and clinical studies for current and emerging respiratory viruses, particularly coronaviruses, influenza viruses and respiratory syncytial viruses."
1,"This study examined land use land cover change and its determinants in Tigray, Ethiopia and its livelihood zones. We used socioeconomic panel, and satellite data, and applied a mixed-effects model to analyse the factors influencing land allocation among different uses, and transition matrix to analyse land cover dynamics. The results revealed that; land use choices were influenced by plot level factors (such as plot elevation, distance, soil type and quality, and land tenure), household characteristics (such as education, dependency ratio, plot size and number owned, income, livestock and asset, perception of climate change, and access to market and main road), and community level factors (precipitation, product price, population density and livelihood zone variations). Transition matrix analysis showed that between 1986 and 2016, 12.8% of forest was converted to bare land, 6.26% bare land was converted to pasture, and 5.84% of cropland was converted to forest. However, net deforestation occurred in most of the livelihood zones. Therefore, local communities faced environmental and socio-economic challenges from capital constraints induced land fallowing, land fragmentation, and unmanaged land cover change. The study recommended sustainable land use planning and management, market linkages, improved access to roads, forestry subsidies, land tenure security, and land consolidation programs."
1,"BACKGROUND: Extreme hot weather conditions have been associated with increased morbidity and mortality, but risks are not evenly distributed throughout the population. Previously, a heat vulnerability index (HVI) was created to geographically locate populations with increased vulnerability to heat in metropolitan areas throughout the United States. OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine whether areas with higher heat vulnerability, as characterized by the HVI, experienced higher rates of morbidity and mortality on abnormally hot days. METHODS: We used Poisson regression to model the interaction of HVI and deviant days (days whose deviation of maximum temperature from the 30-year normal maximum temperature is at or above the 95th percentile) on hospitalization and mortality counts in five states participating in the Environmental Public Health Tracking Network for the years 2000 through 2007. RESULTS: The HVI was associated with higher hospitalization and mortality rates in all states on both normal days and deviant days. However, associations were significantly stronger (interaction p-value < 0.05) on deviant days for heat-related illness, acute renal failure, electrolyte imbalance, and nephritis in California, heat-related illness in Washington, all-cause mortality in New Mexico, and respiratory hospitalizations in Massachusetts. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the HVI may be a marker of health vulnerability in general, although it may indicate greater vulnerability to heat in some cases."
1,"As anthropogenic transformation of Earth's ecology accelerates, and its impacts on the sustainability of humanity and the rest of nature become more obvious, geographers and other researchers are leveraging an abundance of spatial data to map how industrialization is transforming the biosphere. This review examines the methodologies used to create such maps and how they have enhanced our understanding of how societies can abate biodiversity loss, mitigate climate change, and achieve global sustainability goals. Although there have been great advances over the past two decades in mapping industrial transformations of ecology across the planet, the field is still in its infancy.We outline future research directions to better understand anthropogenic transformation of the biosphere and the utility of integrating global maps of socioeconomic, ecological, biodiversity, and climate data to explore and inform potential pathways of human-driven social-ecological change."
1,"Because climate change is predicted to have a strong impact on high-altitude ecosystems, a better knowledge of litter decomposition in alpine ecosystems is critical to improve our predictions of the effect of climate change on ecosystem processes and services such as nutrient cycling, carbon sequestration, and below-ground biodiversity. To evaluate the effects of vegetation types [alpine shrubland (AS) and alpine meadow (AM)] and litter quality on litter decomposition and related biochemical processes, the decomposition of leaf litter of two dominant shrub species, Sorbus rufopilosa (SR, high quality) and Rhododendron lapponicum (RL, low quality), was studied using the litterbag method in an alpine treeline ecotone on the eastern Tibetan Plateau. After 1 year of decomposition, cellulolytic enzyme activities and gram-negative bacterial biomass were higher in shrubland than in meadow. However, higher fungal biomass, fungal/bacteria ratio and ligninolytic activity were observed in meadow than in shrubland after 2 years of decomposition. During the first year of decomposition, litter decomposition was faster in shrubland than in meadow probably due to the home-field advantage (HFA) effect and the bacteria-dominated decomposition, whereas in later decomposition stages, litter decomposition was faster in meadow than in shrubland, as the HFA effect diminished and fungal-dominated decomposition of recalcitrant components took over. These results indicated that litter quality effects were generally strongest in the first year and diminished in later stages when the effect of vegetation type in incubation sites developed."

0,"Vocal actors within policy and practice contend that environmental variability and shocks, such as drought and prolonged heat waves, drive civil wars in Africa. Recently, a widely publicized scientific article appears to substantiate this claim. This paper investigates the empirical foundation for the claimed relationship in detail. Using a host of different model specifications and alternative measures of drought, heat, and civil war, the paper concludes that climate variability is a poor predictor of armed conflict. Instead, African civil wars can be explained by generic structural and contextual conditions: prevalent ethno-political exclusion, poor national economy, and the collapse of the Cold War system."
1,"Terrestrial water storage (TWS) includes all forms of water stored on and below the land surface, and is a key determinant of global water and energy budgets. However, TWS data from measurements by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission are only available from 2002, limiting global and regional understanding of the long-term trends and variabilities in the terrestrial water cycle under climate change. This study presents long-term (i.e., 1940-2022) and relatively high-resolution (i.e., 0.25 circle ) monthly time series of TWS anomalies over the global land surface. The reconstruction is achieved by using a set of machine learning models with a large number of predictors, including climatic and hydrological variables, land use/land cover data, and vegetation indicators (e.g., leaf area index). The outcome, machine-learning-reconstructed TWS estimates (i.e., GTWS-MLrec), fits well with the GRACE/GRACE-FO measurements, showing high correlation coefficients and low biases in the GRACE era. We also evaluate GTWS-MLrec with other independent products such as the land-ocean mass budget, atmospheric and terrestrial water budget in 341 large river basins, and streamflow measurements at 10 168 gauges. The results show that our proposed GTWS-MLrec performs overall as well as, or is more reliable than, previous TWS datasets. Moreover, our reconstructions successfully reproduce the consequences of climate variability such as strong El Nino events. The GTWS-MLrec dataset consists of three reconstructions based on (a) mascons of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology, the Center for Space Research at the University of Texas at Austin, and the Goddard Space Flight Center of NASA; (b) three detrended and de-seasonalized reconstructions; and (c) six global average TWS series over land areas, both with and without Greenland and Antarctica. Along with its extensive attributes, GTWS_MLrec can support a wide range of geoscience applications such as better understanding the global water budget, constraining and evaluating hydrological models, climate-carbon coupling, and water resources management."
0,"Multi-species indicators are often used to assess biodiversity trends. By combining population trends across several species they summarise trends across a community. Composite indicators such as these are useful for examining general temporal patterns and may suggest important drivers of biodiversity change. However, they may also mask substantial spatial variation in population trends, particularly when they are calculated over large spatial regions. We produced spatially-explicit indicators for farmland and woodland bird communities in the UK and further separate these into trends for generalist and specialist species within each group. We found considerable spatial variation in the indicators, which is masked by indicators calculated at the national level. The farmland community indicator showed mostly positive trends in western areas and extensive declines in south-east England. The woodland community indicator showed a north-south divide, with increases in Scotland and northern England and stability in the southern regions. For both communities, indicator trends for specialist species were more negative than those for generalists. We found no significant difference in farmland community indicators between arable land and improved grassland. Woodland specialists had significantly more negative trends in broadleaf compared to coniferous woodlands, suggesting habitat-type is one of the drivers of changes in the woodland community. These spatial patterns in bird population trends may be used to highlight regional conservation priorities and identify where those may differ from the national scale. In combination with information about other environmental changes, they may also be used to develop hypotheses about potential drivers of change. We advocate that this approach is adopted for other taxa and geographical areas. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
1,"River flow to the Baltic Sea originates under a range of different climate regimes in a drainage basin covering some 1 600 000 km(2). Changes to the climate in the Baltic Basin will not only affect the total amount of freshwater flowing into the sea, but also the distribution of the origin of these flows. Using hydrological modeling, the effects of future climate change on river runoff to the Baltic Sea have been analyzed. Four different climate change scenarios from the Swedish Regional Climate Modelling Programme (SWECLIM) were used. The resulting change to total mean annual river flow to the Baltic Sea ranges from -2% to +15% of present-day flow according to the different climate scenarios. The magnitude of changes within different subregions of the basin varies considerably, with the most severe mean annual changes ranging from -30% to +40%. However, common to all of the scenarios evaluated is a general trend of reduced river flow from the south of the Baltic Basin together with increased river flow from the north."
1,"Indonesia is very vulnerable to flooding due to urbanization of land use, industrialization and made worse by climate change. Sidoarjo is an urban area that frequently experiences regular flooding every year. The flooding break up local traffic, disrupting economic distribution and transportation routes. Minimum information about areas that are often flooded causes a lack of people and government attention to the effects of floods. In this paper, we develop a Fuzzy approach to determine the level of urban flood risk in Sidoarjo. The parameters consist of flood inundation, rainfall, population affected, and drainage. The Fuzzy sets produce fuzzy membership values, and evaluation rules determine the level of flood disaster in each village in Sidoarjo, classified into three levels of vulnerability, they are high, medium and low level of flood vulnerability. Analysis of the results of the calculation of flood risk assessment with Fuzzy multi-criteria decision making (FMCDM) shows a good result with accuracy of 66% compared to the analysis of the Sidoarjo Regional Disaster Management Agency inundation data. However, in reality flood risk is not only caused by inundation factor, the FMCDM method is represented a better assessment in real world. The spatial decision support system using geographical information systems (GIS) provides effective, efficient and useful in flood risk management for local and national governmental agencies."
1,"Land use/land cover (LULC) and climate are two crucial environmental factors that impact watershed hydrology worldwide. The current study seeks to comprehend how the evolving climate and LULC patterns are impacting the hydrology of the Mahanadi Reservoir catchment. A semi-distributed Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was utilized to simulate various water balance elements. Twelve distinct scenarios were developed by combining three different climatic data periods (1985-1996, 1997-2008, and 2009-2020) with four sets of land use maps (1985, 1995, 2005, and 2014). The SWAT model demonstrated strong performance in simulating monthly stream flows throughout the calibration and validation phases. The study reveals that changes in LULC have a distinct effect on the environment. Specifically, the changes in LULC lead to heightened streamflow and reduced evapotranspiration (ET). These changes are mainly attributed to amplified urbanization and the diminished presence of water bodies, forest cover, and barren land within the Mahanadi Reservoir catchment. The combined impact of climate change and LULC shifts reveals complex interactions. Therefore, the present study offers an understanding of how changes in climate and land use over the past few decades have influenced the hydrological behavior of the Mahanadi Reservoir catchment in Chhattisgarh. The findings of this study have the potential to offer advantages to governmental bodies, policymakers, water resource engineers, and planners seeking effective strategies for water resource management. These strategies would be particularly relevant in the context of climate change and land use/land cover changes in ecological regions similar to those of the Mahanadi Reservoir catchment. In addition, a rational regulatory framework for land use patterns is essential for assisting stakeholders in managing water resources and appropriately developing the entire catchment."
1,"Global commitments to protect 30% of land by 2030 present an opportunity to combat the biodiversity crisis, but reducing extinction risk will depend on where countries expand protection. Here, we explore a range of 30x30 conservation scenarios that vary what dimension of biodiversity is prioritized (taxonomic groups, species-at-risk, biodiversity facets) and how protection is coordinated (transnational, national, or regional approaches) to test which decisions influence our ability to capture biodiversity in spatial planning. Using Canada as a model nation, we evaluate how well each scenario captures biodiversity using scalable indicators while accounting for climate change, data bias, and uncertainty. We find that only 15% of all terrestrial vertebrates, plants, and butterflies (representing only 6.6% of species-at-risk) are adequately represented in existing protected land. However, a nationally coordinated approach to 30x30 could protect 65% of all species representing 40% of all species-at-risk. How protection is coordinated has the largest impact, with regional approaches protecting up to 38% fewer species and 65% fewer species-at-risk, while the choice of biodiversity incurs much smaller trade-offs. These results demonstrate the potential of 30x30 while highlighting the critical importance of biodiversity-informed national strategies."
1,"Water is one of the most valuable and scarce natural resources on Earth. Its availability and quality affect the economy and the health of populations. There are several highly water-dependent economic sectors. Extreme events such as El Nino, La Nina, or global warming affect water availability, income, employment, and labor productivity. More than 80% of the population of Latin America is concentrated in cities. However, the water supply is insufficient and of poor quality. 70% of wastewater has no treatment, making it difficult to re-use it and to complete the water cycle due to contamination. Water pollution occurs at the primary, secondary and tertiary levels of water sources. Substances that pollute water are organic and inorganic. An underlying concern is the contamination of water by the presence of high levels of inorganic arsenic, lead and cadmium, and their negative consequences on human health such as cancer, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease. Although some evidence of this problem and the efforts of wastewater treatment by corresponding institutions is observed in Colombia and Peru, there is still a long way to go to solve this problem in Latin America."
0,"Examining the ecological consequences of the late Quaternary megafaunal extinctions within biodiversity hotspots is crucial for our understanding of the potential consequences of contemporary extinctions. We present the first multi-species record of spores of coprophilous fungi (SCF) from Monquentiva and the high-Andean forests of Colombia to reconstruct Late Pleistocene and Holocene megafaunal abundance. Fossilised pollen and charcoal are used to examine the consequences of megafaunal declines on the surrounding vegetation and fire activity. Our SCF record indicates the presence of Pleistocene megafauna at least since 30,290 BP, with two waves of megafaunal decline at ca. 22,900 BP and 10,990 BP. At Monquentiva, megafaunal decline in the Early Holocene resulted in transitional non-analogue vegetation, loss of some herbivore-dispersed plant taxa, an encroachment of palatable and woody flora, and a rise in fire activity. Differences with other published South-American records suggest that ecological consequences of megafaunal declines were habitat-specific. Overall, we show that ecosystems in the eastern Colombian Cordillera were highly sensitive to the decline of megafaunal populations. Under the current biodiversity crisis, management and conservation efforts must account for the effects of local herbivore declines on plant dispersal, on fire activity, and the potential loss of ecosystem services."
1,"The soils beneath the rainforest of Guyana have the potential to hold, and release, large stores of carbon under land use and climate change. Little is known about soil carbon stocks or molecular dynamics in this region. This study therefore aims to elucidate differences in the molecular (lignin and tannin) and bulk soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in different 'sub-environments' along a rainforest-savannah boundary, setting a framework for further investigation into the soil carbon dynamics of the region. Bulk SOC analysis shows that Gleysols have the highest stocks, particularly those under rainforest vegetation (swamp and island forests surrounded by savannah), whereas Plinthosols have significantly lower SOC stocks. Texture and soil water content analysis indicates that predominantly clay soils play a role in high SOC stocks, whilst predominantly sandy soils prevent SOC stocks from accumulating. Clay and sand are present in both Gleysols and Plinthosols, to different extents. Analysis of lignin and tannin in surface soils of the sub-environments reveals clear differences in molecular composition. Heavily degraded lignin signatures in rainforest Gleysols suggests a surrounding physio-chemical environment which promotes their degradation. Conversely, Plinthosols beneath woodland within the savannah have the greatest amount of lignin and tannin products. The presence of the clay mineral kaolinite and iron oxide strengite in these soils indicates a low ability for protection or complexing of organic matter. Therefore, water content and microbial activity may play a more important role in the degradation of lignin and tannin, as well as the SOC stock. With the potential for future deforestation due to land use or climate change, the high lignin degradation of Gleysols indicates a vulnerability to savannah encroachment. Forest Islands isolated from the main forest biome are the most vulnerable to change, and could lose a significant proportion of their SOC stock in a transition to savannah."
1,"Changes in precipitation extremes under greenhouse warming are commonly assumed to be constrained by changes in the amounts of precipitable water in the atmosphere(1-4). Global climate models generally predict only marginal changes in relative humidity(5), implying that the actual amount of atmospheric precipitable water scales with the water vapour content of saturation, which is governed by the Clausius-Clapeyron relation. Indeed, changes in daily precipitation extremes in global climate models seem to be consistent with the 7% increase per degree of warming given by the Clausius-Clapeyron relation(3,4), but it is uncertain how general this scaling behaviour is across timescales. Here, we analyse a 99-year record of hourly precipitation observations from De Bilt, the Netherlands, and find that one-hour precipitation extremes increase twice as fast with rising temperatures as expected from the Clausius-Clapeyron relation when daily mean temperatures exceed 12 degrees C. In addition, simulations with a high-resolution regional climate model show that one-hour precipitation extremes increase at a rate close to 14% per degree of warming in large parts of Europe. Our results demonstrate that changes in short-duration precipitation extremes may well exceed expectations from the Clausius-Clapeyron relation. These short-duration extreme events can have significant impacts, such as local flooding, erosion and water damage."
1," Gridded climatologies have become an indispensable component of bioclimatic modelling, with a range of applications spanning conservation and pest management. Such globally conformal data sets of historical and future scenario climate surfaces are required to model species potential ranges under current and future climate scenarios. 2. We developed a set of interpolated climate surfaces at 10' and 30' resolution for global land areas excluding Antarctica. Input data for the baseline climatology were gathered from the WorldClim and CRU CL1.0 and CL2.0 data sets. A set of future climate scenarios were generated at 10' resolution. For each of the historical and future scenario data sets, the full set of 35 Bioclim variables was generated. Climate variables (including relative humidity at 0900 and 1500 hours) were also generated in CLIMEX format. The Koppen-Geiger climate classification scheme was applied to the 10' hybrid climatology as a tool for visualizing climatic patterns and as an aid for specifying absence or background data for correlativemodelling applications. 3. We tested the data set using a correlative model (MaxEnt) addressing conservation biology concerns for a rare Australian shrub, and a mechanistic niche model (CLIMEX) to map climate suitability for two invasive species. In all cases, the underlying climatology appeared to behave in a robust manner. 4. This global climate data set has the advantage over theWorldClimdata set of including humidity data and an additional 16 Bioclim variables. Compared with the CRU CL2.0 data set, the hybrid 10' data set includes improved precipitation estimates as well as projected climate for two global climate models running relevant greenhouse gas emission scenarios. 5. For many bioclimatic modelling purposes, there is an operational attraction to having a globally conformal historical climatology and future climate scenarios for the assessments of potential climate change impacts. Our data set is known as 'CliMond' and is available for free download from http://www.climond.org."
1,"Beef production is a major driver of biodiversity loss and greenhouse gas emissions globally, and multiple studies recommend reducing beef production and consumption. Although there have been significant efforts from the biodiversity conservation sector toward reducing beef-production impacts, there has been comparatively much less engagement in reducing beef consumption. As a first step to address this gap and identify leverage points, we conducted a policy Delphi expert elicitation. We asked 16 multidisciplinary experts from research and practitioner backgrounds to propose interventions for reducing beef consumption in the United States. Experts generated and critiqued 20 interventions, creating a qualitative dataset that was thematically analyzed to allow the interventions to be prioritized. Effective, feasible interventions included changing perceived social norms, targeting food providers, and increasing the availability and quality of beef alternatives. This work introduces a conservation research agenda for reducing beef consumption and explores a structured process for prioritizing behavioral interventions."
1,"Aim Species distribution models (SDMs) are a widely used tool to estimate and map habitat suitability for wildlife populations. Most studies that model marine mammal density or distributions use oceanographic proxies for marine mammal prey. However, proxies could be a problem for forecasting because the relationships between the proxies and prey may change in a changing climate. We examined the use of model-derived prey estimates in SDMs using an iconic species, the western Arctic bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus). Location Western Beaufort Sea, Alaska, USA. Methods We used Biology Ice Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System (BIOMAS) to simulate ocean conditions important to western Arctic bowhead whales, including important prey species. Using both static and dynamic predictors, we applied Maxent and boosted regression tree (BRT) SDMs to predict bowhead whale habitat suitability on an 8-day timescale. We compared results from models that used bathymetry with those that used only BIOMAS simulated variables. Results The best model included bathymetry and BIOMAS variables. Inclusion of dynamic variables in SDMs produced predictions that reflected temporal dynamics evident from the survey data. Bathymetry was the most influential variable in models that included that variable. Zooplankton was the most important variable for models that did not include bathymetry. Models with bathymetry performed slightly better than models with only BIOMAS derived variables. Main conclusions Bathymetry and modelled zooplankton were the most important predictor variables in bowhead whale distribution models. Our predictions reflected within-year variability in bowhead whale habitat suitability. Using modelled prey availability, rather than oceanographic proxies, could be important for forecasting species distributions. Predictor variables used in our study were derived from a biophysical ocean model with demonstrated ability to project future ocean conditions. A natural next step is to use output from our biophysical ocean model to understand the effects of Arctic climate change."
1,"The relationship between heat exposure and perinatal morbidity and mortality is of increasing concern as global temperatures rise and extreme heat events become more frequent and intense. Heat exposure can lead to a multitude of harmful outcomes for pregnant individuals and neonates, including hospitalization and death. This state of the science review explored the evidence on the associations between heat exposure and negative health outcomes during pregnancy and the neonatal period. Findings suggest that improving health care provider and patient awareness of heat-related risks and implementing specific interventions could mitigate adverse outcomes. Furthermore, public health and other policy interventions are needed to increase thermal comfort and reduce societal exposure to extreme heat and related risks. Early warning systems, medical alerts, provider and patient education, and increased access to health care and thermal comfort may improve pregnancy and early life health outcomes."
1,"The global plastics pollution crisis has multiple visible and invisible effects on marine, land and air environments. Fossil fuel-based plastics production is projected to triple by 2060, driving a plastics lifecycle that exacerbates climate change, contaminates ecosystems and poses risks to human rights, especially the human right to health. Existing governance measures help tackle plastics waste pollution but cannot effec-tively address its systemic nature. Drafting a Global Plastics Treaty, due for adoption in 2025, is an opportunity to design ambitious international plastics governance. This article argues for a human rights-based approach to the proposed treaty's framing and substance by integrating, in particular, the human right to health, supplemented by the human right to a healthy environment. Embedding human rights considerations through a precautionary and preventative approach, shifting responsibility to polluters and showing concern for intergenerational equity would combat plastics pollution, accelerate climate action, protect ocean ecosystems and safeguard human rights."
1,"Threatened species in rainforests may be vulnerable to climate change, because of their potentially narrow thermal tolerances, small population sizes and restricted distributions. This study modelled climate induced changes on the habitat distribution of the endangered rainforest plant Triunia robusta, endemic to southeast Queensland, Australia. Species distribution models were developed for eastern Australia at 250m grids and southeast Queensland at 25 m grids using ground-truthed presence records and environmental predictor data. The species' habitat distribution under the current climate was modelled, and the future potential habitat distributions were projected for the epochs 2030, 2050 and 2070. The eastern Australia model identified several spatially disjunct, broad habitat areas of coastal eastern Australia consistent with the current distribution of rainforests, and projected a southward and upslope contraction driven mainly by average temperatures exceeding current range limits. The southeast Queensland models suggest a dramatic upslope contraction toward locations where the majority of known populations are found. Populations located in the Sunshine Coast hinterland, consistent with past rainforest refugia, are likely to persist long-term. Upgrading the level of protection for less formal nature reserves containing viable populations is a high priority to better protect refugial T. robusta populations with respect to climate change."
1,"Quercus infectoria and Quercus libani are two important species distributed across most of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq's mountain ranges (KRI). They have significant ecological, medicinal, and socioeconomic values. Recent studies have documented how plant distributions have been impacted by climate change. This study's goal is to establish the existing distributions of both species, measure the consequences of prospective environmental conditions on their distributions, predict possible habitat distributions, map the overlapped habitat ranges for the species in the KRI, and identify the key factors influencing their distributions. For these aims, distribution data points of the species, different environmental factors, including the existing climate, three emission predictions for the 2050s, 2070s, and 2090s of two general circulation models (GCMs), a machine learning approach, and geospatial techniques were used. Modeling revealed that the total magnitude of the habitat increase for the species would be less than the overall magnitude of the habitat contraction. The yearly mean temperature, yearly precipitation, and minimum temperature during the coldest period mostly alter the target species' geographic dispersion. Across the three emission scenarios of the both models, Q. infectoria habitat would contract by 2760.9-2856.9 km2 (5.36-5.55%), 2856.9-3357.2 km2 (5.55-6.52%) and 2822.1-3400.2 km2 (5.48-6.60%), whereas it would expand by 1153.3-1638.9 km2 (2.24-3.18%), 761.0-1556.8 km2 (1.48-3.02%), and 721.5-1547.1 km2 (1.40-3.00%) for the 2050s, 2070s, and 2090s, respectively. A similar pattern was also noted for Q. libani. The two species' habitat ranges in KRI would be considerably reduced due to climate change. The species' estimated area would extend mostly to the east and southeast of the KRI at high altitudes. The mountain areas, notably those where the species overlap by 1767.2-1807.5 km2 (3.43-3.51%) for the two GCMs, must be the primary objective of conservation efforts. This research presents new baseline data for future research on mountain forest ecosystems and the techniques of biodiversity conservation to reduce climate change's effects in Iraq."
1,"Regional climate models were used with the UKCP09 weather generator to downscale outputs from the HadCM3 General Circulation Model, to project climate change by 2050 in the Scottish Highlands. The resulting hydroclimatic data were used to drive a tracer-aided hydrological model to assess likely changes in flow regimes in three experimental catchments. These are located along a hydroclimatic transect from the wet, mild western Highlands (Strontian), through the colder, more continental central Highlands (Allt a' Mharcaidh), to the drier eastern Highlands (Girnock). At all sites, temperatures are projected to increase by around 2 degrees C, with associated increases in potential evapotranspiration. Precipitation is expected to increase by around 1015% at Strontian but remains slightly changed at the Allt a' Mharcaidh and Girnock. However, the seasonal distribution of precipitation is projected to change, increasing in winter and decreasing in summer. Cautious interpretation of model outputs indicates that flows are likely to change accordingly at all sites, though the characteristics of each catchment result in some subtle differences. At Strontian, marked increases in winter high flows are expected, at the Allt a' Mharcaidh, reduction in winter snowfall and reduced snowpack will increase winter high flows and moderate the influence of spring melts. In the Girnock, decreasing summer low flows are the most notable element of change. These subtle differences in response to climatic drivers are consistent with the distinct storage characteristics of the catchments which in turn reflect their landscape evolution histories.

1,"How tree growth responds to climate is determined by temperature and water availability, but climate change is causing shifts in forest growth that could be evaluated through tree-ring growth studies given that it is annual radial increase is influenced by interannual and multiannual climatic variations. We evaluated the influence of oceanic-atmospheric indices and the climate response on the annual radial increase of Pinus hartwegii Lindl. A total of 140 increment cores were obtained from 82 selected P. hartwegii specimens growing at the treeline of the Tancitaro stratovolcano, Michoacan, Mexico to develop a 348-year long ring-width chronology. Correlation and response function analyses were carried out between the tree-ring series and monthly climate records and by subperiods of 50 yrs. Climate records were obtained from six weather stations near the study site and oceanic-atmospheric indices were downloaded from international climatic sources. The chronology was related to drought indices involving precipitation, temperature, evaporation, and soil water content. The results indicated that accumulated precipitation from February to April, and the mean and minimum temperature from March to May and from September to November of the current growth year, had a positive correlation with the P. hartwegii ring-width chronology. The maximum temperature of March and May of the current growth year produced a negative correlation and in November positive correlation. The analysis of the response function indicated that P. hartwegii had a negative growth response to the average and maximum temperature of March. The analysis of the response function in 50-year subperiods indicated a stable response in precipitation from February to April of the period 1925 to 2000. However, when the temperature increased, the stability of the growth response became negative, mainly due to an increase in temperature in combination with low precipitation volumes, which usually occurs from March to May. The association between the ring-width series, and indices of ENSO (MEI, El Nino 4) showed a significant positive correlation, but negative with SOI. Similarly, the relationship with the PDO was positive, but negative with AMO. The association with drought indices (PDSI + JJA, PDSI*, SPEI) was positive and significant. We conclude that the populations of P. hartwegii of the Tancitaro stratovolcano constitute an ecological indicator of long-term precipitation and temperature variability and is a high-resolution proxy for regional rainfall reconstruction at least for the last three centuries."
1,"Extreme weather events seem to have become more frequent with climate change. These anomalies throughout the world may generally be categorized as drought, heavy rain storms, landslides, heavy snow storms, sea level rise, ice melts from the polar regions, tornadoes and hurricanes. The environmental and real property damage caused may be minimized if proper planning and best practices are engineered into place before the catastrophic events occur. The management of vulnerable areas should definitely include such plans and strategies. The purpose of the current work is to point to the best practices already being carried out in some areas, and to draw attention to some of the knowledge embodied in the indigenous populations in particular regions, which have come by this knowledge via generations of survival through adverse climate/ environmental changes. The integration of this indigenous knowledge where applicable, with modern engineering tools and techniques will help the world better to face the climatic challenges ahead."
0,"Health disparities occur when adverse health conditions are unequal across populations due in part to gaps in wealth. These disparities continue to plague global health. Decades of research suggests that the natural environment can play a key role in sustaining the health of the public. However, the influence of the natural environment on health disparities is not well-articulated. Green spaces provide ecosystem services that are vital to public health. This paper discusses the link between green spaces and some of the nation's leading health issues such as obesity, cardiovascular health, heat-related illness, and psychological health. These associations are discussed in terms of key demographic variables-race, ethnicity, and income. The authors also identify research gaps and recommendations for future research."
1,"Understanding the fluctuations in groundwater levels in response to meteorological conditions is challenging, especially given the slow transit time associated with groundwater reservoirs and the short duration of time series for groundwater levels. Nevertheless, this knowledge is crucial for water resource management, especially given that global warming will drastically impact the hydrological dynamics in cold and humid climates. The objective of this work was to quantify how standardized indexes contribute to understanding groundwater level fluctuations in response to meteorological conditions in cold and humid climates and with short time series (10 to 23 years). The relationships between the standardized precipitation index (SPI), standardized temperature index (STI), global climate indexes, and standardized groundwater index (SGI) were analyzed. The reactivity of groundwater levels was examined between 2000 and 2022 using groundwater level measurements from 152 wells located between 46 degrees N and 52 degrees N in the province of Quebec (Canada). The results showed that the available time series were sufficient to provide new insights into the role of precipitation and temperature on groundwater fluctuations, demonstrating the usefulness of the indexes. One of the main contributions of this study was that hydrogeological systems in cold and humid climates go through an annual reset due to the prolonged freezing period. This annual reset was one of the drivers isolating year-to-year hydrogeological conditions, contributing to short -duration droughts."
1,"The Tizinafu watershed is characterized by extremely scarce precipitation and low temperature, and snow and glacier melting which dominate the main water resource of this area. Thus, assessing the snowmelt water resource has great significance to local residents and ecological systems. Based on snowmelt runoff model (SRM) and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation, four combinations of meteorological data consisting of two daily temperature data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the variable infiltration capacity (VIC) model and two daily precipitation data from Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and VIC, respectively, are evaluated for this ungauged basin in Bayesian uncertainty analysis. By comparing the performances of the four meteorological data combinations based on SRM (SRMMODIS + TRMM, SRMMODIS + VIC, SRMVIC + TRMM and SRMVIC + VIC, the former and latter subscripts denote temperature and precipitation data, respectively), results show that the four SRMs are both capable of reproducing the runoff process of the Tizinafu watershed on daily runoff simulation, and SRMVIC + VIC has the best performance. In addition, the impact of climate change on the water resources of the Tizinafu watershed is also evaluated in Bayesian uncertainty analysis, and four climate change scenarios under the condition of Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 of CMIP5 projection are considered. The results demonstrate that the mean annual runoff prediction of the 2090s increased by 17.2%, 20.2%, 24.1%, and 16.2% compared to that of base year for the four scenarios, respectively. In addition, with the increase of the cryosphere area, snow cover area will have an increasing impact on the mean annual runoff of the study area in the 2090s. The runoff components of snowpack melt and new snow are both sensitive to the cryosphere area, while the runoff component of rainfall is not sensitive to the cryosphere area."
0,"In the centuries following the Enlightenment, scientific and technological developments gave 'modern people' an unprecedented ability to understand, predict and control the natural world. This has brought health and social benefits unimaginable to our ancestors and sets us apart from all previous generations. Yet there is a wide-ranging body of evidence that suggests that modernity is now in decline, largely because its methods and mindset are increasingly recognized as unsustainable. Problems are manifest in the emergence of new public health epidemics such as obesity and addictive behaviours, the loss of well-being and increase in anxiety and depression in affluent society, and the persistence of ever-widening health and social inequalities at national and global levels. Still larger problems now confront us, such as climate change, peak oil and the loss of biodiversity, all of which are linked to the 'modern' way of life. We are potentially faced with the collapse of certain aspects of modern society: we are certainly faced with the prospect of inevitable change. While the broad public health community has an important role to play in developing workable solutions to such daunting problems, we argue that some profound changes will be needed in order for us to cope successfully. No blueprints for dealing with change exist, which means that we will need to learn our way into the future. In this paper we take a perspective on the role and nature of the future practitioner in public health and health promotion. We argue that future practitioners will need to develop new ways of thinking, being and doing; new perspectives and new forms of understanding the world. We believe our discipline - and people generally - to be capable of such development, as insights from multiple sources tell us that human nature is malleable, not fixed. We use this analysis to trace, as examples, the imagined lives of five women living in different eras over the course of history in a Western society, and the emergence of different mindsets or worldviews, as the social, economic and cultural context changes. Post-modern analysts might insist that we have no basis for making value judgements between such different worldviews. In this paper, however, we argue that future practitioners should be empathetic to different views and willing to move beyond them, as necessary. We will need to learn and develop in ways that are compatible with our intrinsic needs as human beings and the needs of our ecosystem. We conclude by suggesting just some of the supportive processes of change needed in mapping out a more sustainable future for the public health community."
1,"Pinus halepensis plantations are widespread throughout semiarid-subhumid landscapes of the Mediterranean. Recently, drought-induced decline has often been reported raising concerns with regard to the future of these man-made ecosystems. The study was set out to investigate thinning as a means to alleviate water stress and improve performance of mature P. halepensis plantations experiencing prolonged drought. The study was conducted in a 40-year-old P. halepensis forest in the Jerusalem Mountains of Israel (rainfall: 550 mm year -1). Declining stands (stand basal area increment, BAI(stand) approximate to -3 % year(-1)) were treated by thinning: (1) intense thinning-tree density, BA(stand), and leaf area index (LAI) reduced by 81, 68, and 59 %, respectively; (2) moderate-56, 48, and 26 %, respectively; (3) control (similar to 560 tree ha(-1)). Plots of 70 x 70 m were used in four replicates. Individual tree-to stand-level variables were monitored during 4 years through stem and leaf area metrics alongside with predawn shoot water potential (psi(PD)) and tree mortality. Thinning ameliorated drought stress, reduced mortality, and improved individual tree growth (psi(PD) = -1.7, -1.8, and -2.0 MPa; mortality = 0.2, 2, and 5 % year(-1); BAI(tree) = 3.4, 2.0, and 1.4 % year(-1) in intense, moderate, and control treatments, respectively). Thinning effects became more pronounced with time. LAI and individual tree leaf area (LA(tree)) fluctuated with association to annual rainfall. Higher LA(tree) caused by thinning reflected a selection effect'' while increased leaf area efficiency (BAI per unit LA(tree)) was attributed to a release effect'' of thinning."
0,"Urban sustainability relies on strategic documents such as the Urban Development Plans (UDPs). The major aim of this research is to use keyword matching to assess key sustainability terms in UDPs for Romanian urban areas. We found a low level of accessibility of the UDPs, with 11 counties (out of 42) having no available UDPs and 20% of the accessed UDPs being outdated. 83% of the 201 search terms were identified in the UDPs. The categories covering culture, economy, society, health, risks and hazards had the highest sustainability scores while the categories institutions, research and innovation, climate and waste had low scores. We found higher average sustainability scores for the topics nature, culture and system approach in recent UDPs compared to older UDPs. A qualitatative analysis of 10 terms showed that their actual use in the text had mostly low to moderate relevance for sustainability. There is an urgent need for strengthening the collaborative links between the urban area governing institutions and academic institutions addressing the sustainability of social-environmental systems in order to mainstream key and emerging sustainability concepts into UDPs and to enforce the sustainability of future urban development."
1,"The viability of sea turtle populations during their early stages depends mostly on hatching success and a balanced sex ratio of the hatchlings. In sea turtles, sex is determined by the temperature at which the eggs are incubated. Consequently, climate change can play a critical role in population fitness, because increased temperatures can skew the sex ratio towards females. The Hawksbill Turtle is a Critically Endangered species and Mexico holds one of the largest populations of nesting females worldwide. Given the importance of Mexican Hawksbill populations, it is necessary to evaluate their nest temperatures, particularly during the thermosensitive period, and identify the sex ratio of the hatchlings. Hawksbill Turtle nests were characterized in three nesting beaches from the western Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico, to determine the temperatures of the nests in situ and the sex ratio of the hatchlings. The results showed that the incubation temperature was warmer than the pivotal temperature by 1.255 +/- 0.18 (SE) degrees C, and in 82.05% of the nests monitored with only female hatchlings. This was also confirmed via histology of the gonads of dead hatchlings. The amount of shade above the nests and rainfall were the most influential factors for decreasing nest temperatures. This study shows a trend toward the feminization of hatchlings due to the low percentage of shade above nests which is able to increase the sex ratio bias due to coastal dune deforestation, together with the increase in environmental temperatures due to climate change. The skewed ratio toward females could have negative consequences for the maintenance of sea turtle populations on the Yucatan Peninsula, so is necessary to develop strategies of conservation in order to reduce this trend."
1,"The incidence of floods is rapidly increasing globally, causing significant property damage and human losses. Moreover, Vietnam ranks as one of the top five countries most severely affected by climate change, with 1/3 of residents facing flood risks. This study presents a model to identify flood susceptibility using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) in the GIS environment for Hanoi, Vietnam. Nine flood-conditioning factors were selected and used as initial data. The AHP analysis was utilized to determine the priority levels of these factors concerning flood susceptibility and to assess the consistency of the obtained results to develop a flood-susceptibility map. The performance of the model was found to be significant based on the AUC value for the obtained receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The flood-susceptibility map has five levels of flood susceptibility: the area with a very high susceptibility to flooding accounts for less than 1% of the map, high- susceptibility areas for nearly 11%, moderate-susceptibility areas for more than 65%, low- susceptibility areas for about 22%, and very low-susceptibility areas for 2%. Most of Hanoi has a moderate level of flood susceptibility, which is expected to increase with urban expansion due to the impacts of urbanization. Our findings will be valuable for future research involving urban planners, and disaster management authorities and will enable them to make informed decisions aimed at reducing the impact of urban flooding and enhancing the resilience of urban communities."
1,"Changes in land use and land cover (LULC) are caused by several factors, including climate change, socio-demographic dynamics, human pressures and urban sprawl. These factors alter the structure and functionality of ecosystems and their capacity to provide ecosystem goods and services to society. The study of LULC changes is important for understanding the dynamics of relationships between environmental, social and economic components and for analyzing the factors affecting natural capital. Including ecosystem services (ES) in spatial planning tools and sectoral policies is useful for improving governance. In this paper, the impact of LULC changes on ES provision has been estimated. To this end, we carried out a literature review (Step 1) to select the biophysical and economic coefficients of ES supply by land cover classes and collect them in a database (Step 2). We subsequently aggregated the economic and biophysical coefficients by macro classes (Step 3) and, using the benefit transfer approach, we estimated the change in the supply of ESs concerning permanence and transition phenomena in Italy from 1990 to 2018 (Step 4). The transition phenomena analysis also allowed us to evaluate the consequences of urbanization and urban green space governance on ES supply. Indeed, these urban green spaces can help reduce risks to people's health and safety and mitigate the effects induced by climate change. In total, approximately 800 coefficients (biophysical and economic) of ESs supplied by Corine Land Cover classes were acquired. The results show a reduction in the annual supply of ecosystem services of EUR 927 million (2022) caused by LULC changes between 1990 and 2018. This research proposes a methodology to improve knowledge of ESs concerning anthropogenic impacts and to support land-use planning policies regarding Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development Goals."
1,"The science underpinning biodiversity's importance to human well-being seems to be taken up little by environmental decision makers. Since the 1950s, ecological, evolutionary and environmental research has pointed to the importance of biodiversity as a significant factor influencing the stability and functioning of population, community, eco- and Earth-systems and the environmental services they provide. Despite its prominence and the tremendous contributions to our understanding of the natural world, this field of research, which we term 'bio-functional ecology', seems not to have had the impact it should. Biotic impoverishment, the loss of biodiversity across all scales and across all taxa, continues to worsen. We suggest that redirecting ecology's emphasis on ecological stability to a focus on environmental risk could help bring bio-functional ecology research more into the environmental arena. Rather than managing biodiversity as an agent of ecological stability, biodiversity could be managed as a natural capital asset in a portfolio of social, human, produced and financial capital assets. This would allow using portfolio theory to identify options for minimizing environmental risk while ensuring human well-being. In this essay, we argue that environmental risk more accurately captures people's motivation to preserve and manage biodiversity than does ecological stability. This redirection from stability to risk may provide greater clarity for decision makers and people in general as to why biodiversity is fundamentally linked to human well-being. In doing so, we can help curb the currently unabated spread of biotic impoverishment across the biosphere."
1,"Areas of Western and Central Europe were severely affected by devastating droughts in 2003 and 2015. A sharp decrease in annual atmospheric precipitation led to diminished spring discharges. Analysis of the fluctuations in discharge from three groups of springs in the south of Poland, namely in the Sudetes and Carpathian mountains, and in the German province of Bavaria revealed an average discharge reduction ranging from 52 to 4%. The study proved the existence of a relationship between diminished groundwater recharge from precipitation and the type of rock forming the reservoir as well as the parameters of the rock in the drained catchment. Spring discharge regime was compared for various periods to show that a decline in the regime correlates with a decline in river flow rate; considering the continually changing weather patterns, this correlation is arguably a key factor in sustainable water management."
1,"Most students growing up in the developed world have not had to confront the availability or cost of water. In their experience, water is readily available at a nominal (often invisible) cost. Lifestyle choices are not made on the basis of water cost or availability. Alas, this fortunate circumstance may not always persist. Throughout the world, changes in water availability are becoming more frequent. Even in the United States, some areas are facing water shortage; this typically affects agriculture first, but then the problem spreads more generally into the economy of a region. Our attention has been called to this as a consequence of climate change, but other factors are also important: population growth (increasing demand), water pollution (decreasing supply), increasing affluence (increasing demand) and other factors. These changes will gradually increase our consciousness of water issues and generate a re-examination of the choices we make about water. Much of the water that we consume is a largely-invisible part of the cost of producing the food we eat and the consumer goods we purchase. The water-footprint concept, analogous to the carbon-footprint concept, can provide a useful framework for understanding this complex role of water and for informing our water choices."
1,"This paper examined the relationship between birth weight, precipitation, and temperature in 19 African countries. We matched recorded birth weights from Demographic and Health Surveys covering 1986 through 2010 with gridded monthly precipitation and temperature data derived from satellite and ground-based weather stations. Observed weather patterns during various stages of pregnancy were also used to examine the effect of temperature and precipitation on birth weight outcomes. In our empirical model we allowed the effect of weather factors to vary by the dominant food production strategy (livelihood zone) in a given region as well as by household wealth, mother's education and birth season. This allowed us to determine if certain populations are more or less vulnerable to unexpected weather changes after adjusting for known covariates. Finally we measured effect size by observing differences in birth weight outcomes in women who have one low birth weight experience and at least one healthy birth weight baby. The results indicated that climate does indeed impact birth weight and at a level comparable, in some cases, to the impact of increasing women's education or household electricity status.

1,"Alluvial forests are sensitive to drought induced by climate change and exacerbated by altered flow regimes. Our ability to detect and map their sensitivity to drought is crucial to evaluate the effects of climate change and adjust management practices. Therefore, we explore the potential of multiscale thermal infrared imagery (TIR) to diagnose their sensitivity to droughts. In summer 2022, we sampled leaves and phloem on Populus nigra trees from two sites with contrasted hydrological connectivity along the Ain River (France) to investigate the seasonality of water stress and act as ground truth for airborne TIR images. To map forest sensitivity to drought, we used TIR data from four airborne campaigns and Landsat archives over a larger spatial and temporal extent. Field data showed that stress conditions were reached for both sites but were higher in the site with lower groundwater connectivity, which was also the case for individual tree crown temperatures. At the forest plot scale, canopy temperature was linked to forest connectivity for two of four TIR campaigns, with higher values in the more degraded reaches. Landsat data were used to locate the areas of the riparian forest impacted by a historical drought event and monitor their recovery and proved useful to identify trends. TIR data showed promising results to help detect and map tree water stress in riparian environments. However, stress is not detected in all TIR campaigns, demonstrating that one-shot TIR acquisitions alone are not enough to diagnose stress and complementary in-field eco-physiological measurements are necessary."
1,"Most rural communities in developing countries, rely heavily on traditional biomass for cooking and lighting. Furthermore, a large area of forest land has been changed to other land-use types like agricultural land is becoming a serious problem in Wondo Genet district. This situation largely contributed to deforestation and forest degradation. Hence, assessing the efficiency of adopting an alternative source of energy was found to be very important. This study was carried out to examine the role of biogas technology in fuelwood saving and carbon emission reduction in Wondo Genet district, southern Ethiopia. The multi-stage sampling procedure was followed to select sample households. A total of 152 households (54 adopters and 98 non-adopters) were involved in the household survey. Moreover, 25 test subjects were taken randomly from both adoption categories to conduct Kitchen Performance Test. Descriptive statistics and independent-sample t-test were used to analyze the data. Results showed that the major fuel sources for domestic use were plantation forest, natural forest, crop residue, and animal dung, accounting 46.71 %, 30.92 %, 15.13 %, and 7.24 %, respectively. Among the 54 sampled biogas plants, 32 (59.26 %) were a digester size of 6 m(3) whereas the remaining 22 (40.74 %) were of 8 m(3). The annual fuelwood saving potential of the technology was found to be 1423.06 kg with an emission reduction potential of 2.1 tons of CO2 e per biogas plant annually. Accordingly, all functional biogas plants were estimated to reduce about 91.63 tons of carbon emission annually. Generally, the biogas was found to be a promising technology in combating the pressure on forest resources and mitigating climate change. Therefore, the energy sector of the country should encourage households to adopt biogas plants that have more than 8 m(3) digester size to improve the fuelwood and carbon emission reduction potential."
0,"Climate change impacts have been extensively addressed in academia, politics and industry for decades. However, particularly within the scientific community, the importance of considering further impact categories to ensure holistic environmental assessment and avoid burden shifting is strongly emphasized. Since considering all impact categories might become overwhelming for industry, a prioritization approach can support practitioners to focus their efforts on the most relevant impacts. Therefore, within this paper, an approach for the identification of relevant impact categories is developed for the automotive sector together with Volkswagen AG. The evaluation is conducted using a criteria set including criteria groups relevance for automotive sector and relevance for stakeholders. For the impact categories identified as relevant, an evaluation of LCIA methods is conducted considering the methodologies CML and ReCiPe 2016 and the methods recommended by PEF. The results demonstrate that climate change is by far the most relevant impact category followed by resource use, human toxicity and ecotoxicity from both automotive and stakeholder perspective. Based on the evaluation of the LCIA methods, a combination of different methods can be recommended. This work provides guidance for the automotive sector to prioritize its focus on the most relevant impact categories and to select applicable LCIA methods for their quantification."
1,"National energy models produce aggregate scenarios of generation capacity, energy output, and emissions. However, we need finer scales to study the impact of resource use and air pollution because timing and location determine impacts on sensitive ecosystems and human populations. We present a framework for disaggregating emissions projections to a scale compatible with air quality simulation models. The framework comprises three models that site new power plants consistent with historical patterns while recognizing water, transmission, fuel, and other factors that constrain siting, and then dispatches them consistent with those constraints. The resulting hourly emissions from individual plants are consistent with meteorology, in that peak demands and emissions occur during those hours when temperatures associated with such demands occur. Further, annual emissions vary in a way consistent with year-to-year changes in weather. An application of the framework disaggregates 2030 NO emissions from a national electricity model in an eight-state region under two climate scenarios: no climate change (1990s) and accelerated change (2050s). Between-year variations in emissions patterns under a particular climate exceed differences between average patterns of the two scenarios. This is in part because NOx emissions are capped; thus, the total cannot change, only its distribution over time and space."
1,"Tens of millions of people around the world are already exposed to coastal flooding from tropical cyclones. Global warming has the potential to increase hurricane flooding, both by hurricane intensification and by sea level rise. In this paper, the impact of hurricane intensification and sea level rise are evaluated using hydrodynamic surge models and by considering the future climate projections of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. For the Corpus Christi, Texas, United States study region, mean projections indicate hurricane flood elevation (meteorologically generated storm surge plus sea level rise) will, on average, rise by 0.3 m by the 2030s and by 0.8 m by the 2080s. For catastrophic-type hurricane surge events, flood elevations are projected to rise by as much as 0.5 m and 1.8 m by the 2030s and 2080s, respectively."
1,"The increase in seawater temperature associated with global warming is a significant threat to coral health and is linked to increasing mass mortality events and Vibrio-related coral diseases. In the Mediterranean Sea, the endemic Cladocora caespitosa and the invasive species Oculina patagonica are the main scleractinian corals affected by mass mortalities. In this study, culturable Vibrio spp. assemblages associated with healthy and unhealthy colonies of these two shallow coral species were characterized to assess the presence of Vibrio pathogens in tissue necrosis. Vibrio communities associated with O. patagonica and C. caespitosa showed geographical differences, although these became more homogeneous in unhealthy specimens of both species. Furthermore, the number of recovered Vibrio specimens was more than five times higher in unhealthy than in healthy corals. Within these culturable vibrios, the known pathogens Vibrio mediterranei and Vibrio coralliilyticus were present in unhealthy colonies of both coral species in the two localities, suggesting that they could play a role in the health status of C. caespitosa and thus act as generalist pathogens in Mediterranean corals. Nonetheless, a clonal type of V. coralliilyticus detected in C. caespitosa was not associated with disease signs, suggesting that this species could encompass assemblages with different levels of virulence.

1,"Temnospondyls had a remarkable worldwide distribution throughout the Triassic at a time of periodic arid climates, and were a stable component of Triassic terrestrial ecosystems. Given the postulated ancestral relationship between temnospondyls and modern lissamphibians it is pertinent to recognize that the group may have exhibited some degree of ecological resilience and adaptability. Despite this higher level of plasticity, temnospondyls might still have been susceptible to environmental and climate changes. Although fossil sites are distributed sporadically, we try to circumvent the present geographical and geological biases by combining actual fossil occurrences with environmental conditions derived from general circulation models. Here, we employ species distribution modelling to examine the palaeogeographic and palaeoclimatic distribution of European temnospondyls during the transition from Middle to Late Triassic. The model shows different suitable areas for temnospondyl habitats that give new potential insights on the biogeographic distribution patterns and dispersal potential. We suggest that the Central European Basin functioned as a focal point for Triassic temnospondyl diversification and spread. Moreover, this paper provides the first application of species distribution modelling for Triassic temnospondyls and aids in understanding their climatic niche occupation and evolution."
0,"Coastal meadows provide a wide range of ecosystem services worldwide. In order to better target conservation efforts in these ecosystems, it is necessary to develop highly accurate models that account for the spatial nature of ecosystem structure, processes and functions. In this study, above-ground biomass was predicted at very high spatial resolution in nine study sites in Estonia. A combination of UAV-derived datasets were used to produce vegetation indices and micro topographic models. A random forest algorithm was used to generate above-ground biomass maps and assess the contribution of each predictor variable. The model successfully predicted above-ground biomass at very high accuracies. Additionally, grassland structural heterogeneity was assessed using UAV-derived datasets and vegetation indices. The results were subsequently related to management history at each study site, showing that continuous, monospecific grazing management tends to simplify grassland structure, which could in turn reduce the supply of a key regulation and maintenance ecosystem services: nursery and reproduction habitat for waders. These results also indicate that UAV-based surveys can serve as reliable grassland monitoring tools and could aid in the development of site-specific management strategies."
1,"In many places around the world, soils preserve ancient wooden elements. These are related to archaeological objects such as shipwrecks, water wells or tools, but also to piled constructions supporting buildings and waterworks. In countries like the Netherlands, a significant part of the built environment still stands on wooden piles and some have been in function for more than 600 years. For the preservation of this wood, it is essential that it remains waterlogged. Due to climate change, more and longer periods of drought are expected during which groundwater levels drop. Previously waterlogged wood that finds itself above groundwater loses its water protection as oxygen becomes available and wood degrading fungi become active. It is unclear how much time it takes before these detrimental processes start to have an effect. Therefore, to better protect buried wood, an understanding of the degradation processes under dynamic groundwater levels is needed. This includes the conditions under which the fungi become active and when these conditions occur in and around the wood. To address this complex issue, two experiments were conducted: Firstly, under optimal laboratory conditions, the rate of degradation over time by different fungal species in different wood species was determined. Subsequently, the changing conditions in and around wooden piles after lowering the groundwater level were examined in a field experiment. The latter experiment showed that the wood-soil matrix provides long-term protection against degradation. The soil types appear to be an important factor as well as the moisture content of the wood, both determining for how long the protection can be maintained. Together with the degradation speed by fungi, a risk assessment can be made for specific conditions when drought leads to loss of archaeological cultural heritage or to instability of our (monumental) buildings and structures. & COPY; 2023 Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR).

1,"Tropical peatlands play an important role as carbon pools. Over the last decades, deforestation and degradation of Indonesian peatlands have led to a significant amount of carbon loss. Anthropogenic fires damage the ecology, the economy, and the public health of the entire region. This PhD is based on a case study in Ogan Komering Ilir (OKI) district of Indonesia. In OKI, traditional practices discard unwanted biomass with open fires, and often result in peat fires. We considered different scenarios of biomass valorisation to incite changes of practices, and to reduce peatland fires. We assessed the feasibility of converting aboveground biomass into bioenergy or other ligno-cellulosic materials. We estimated a business as usual (BAU) scenario by evaluating sources of emission of the current land management. We investigated potential mitigation scenarios, including biomass valorisation and peatland restoration, as alternative land management options. We evaluated the impact of these mitigation scenarios on climate change, according to their economic limitations. The analysis of GHG emissions in the BAU scenario shows that areas affected by fire release 70 +/- 30, 140 +/- 31 and 160 +/- 27 Tonnes CO2-eq/ ha/yr for degraded peatland, oil palm plantations and pulpwood plantations, respectively. Areas not affected by fires release 19 +/- 12, 85 +/- 21 and 108 +/- 15 Tonnes CO2-eq/ha/yr, respectively. For the restoration scenario, we found similar GHG emissions of -0.9 Tonnes CO2-eq/ha/yr for the three land uses. Encouraging the biomass market in the areas where it is profitable for farmers could help reducing fire occurrences, without government investment. We instead suggest focusing government efforts on other methods such as incentive payments, or peatland restoration strategies, in the areas where biomass market is not economically viable. For the region, we find that biomass valorisation can reduce the GHG emissions by 4% to 6% compared to the BAU. As such, biomass valorisation is a promising alternative to current practices, potentially reducing the negative impact of fires white generating a new income for the population."
1,"Large-scale reforestation, afforestation, and forest restoration schemes have gained global support as climate change mitigation strategies due to their significant carbon dioxide removal (CDR) potential. However, there has been limited research into the unintended consequences of forestation from a biophysical perspective. In the Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2), we apply a global forestation scenario, within a Paris Agreement-compatible warming scenario, to investigate the land surface and hydroclimate response. Compared to a control scenario where land use is fixed to present-day levels, the forestation scenario is up to 2 degrees C cooler at low latitudes by 2100, driven by a 10 % increase in evaporative cooling in forested areas. However, afforested areas where grassland or shrubland are replaced lead to a doubling of plant water demand in some tropical regions, causing significant decreases in soil moisture (similar to 5 % globally, 5 %-10 % regionally) and water availability (similar to 10 % globally, 10 %-15 % regionally) in regions with increased forest cover. While there are some increases in low cloud and seasonal precipitation over the expanded tropical forests, with enhanced negative cloud radiative forcing, the impacts on large-scale precipitation and atmospheric circulation are limited. This contrasts with the precipitation response to simulated large-scale deforestation found in previous studies. The forestation scenario demonstrates local cooling benefits without major disruption to global hydrodynamics beyond those already projected to result from climate change, in addition to the cooling associated with CDR. However, the water demands of extensive forestation, especially afforestation, have implications for its viability, given the uncertainty in future precipitation changes."
1,"Central Europe, including Germany, has faced exceptional multi-year terrestrial water storage (TWS) deficits since 2018, negatively impacting various sectors such as forestry, energy production, and drinking water supply. Currently, the understanding of the recovery dynamics behind such extreme events is limited, which hampers accurate water management decisions. We used a simulation of the mesoscale hydrological model (mHM) over the last 257 years (1766-2022) to provide the first long-term perspective on the dynamics of the TWS deficit recovery in Germany. The results show that severe TWS deficits surpassing a peak deficit of -42 mm (-15 km3) exhibit large variability in recovery times (3-31 months). The 2018-2021 TWS deficit period was unprecedented in terms of recovery time (31 months), mean intensity and the associated negative 30-year TWS trend. In recent decades, we identified increased evapotranspiration (E) fluxes that have impacted TWS dynamics in Germany. Increased E flux anomalies contributed to prolonged TWS recovery, given that the TWS deficit did not quickly recover through above-average precipitation (P). An extreme TWS deficit similar to that in 2018 was recovered by above-average P within three months in the winter of 1947-1948. Our research contributes to an improved understanding of the dynamics and drivers of TWS deficit recovery."
1,"Aims Rising temperature and declining summer precipitation due to the 1970s-climate shift in southern South America have reduced forest productivity at dry sites. Here, we worked with the most widespread Southern Hemisphere tree line species, Nothofagus pumilio, across contrasting climatic conditions and determined whether rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations as well as warmer and drier climatic conditions provoked by the 70s-climatic shift have been causing systematic changes in tree line growth rates and intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE). Location 36-54 degrees S, southern Andes. Time period 1950-2010. Major taxa studied Nothofagus pumilio. Methods We worked at five disparate climatic tree line locations, spanning 18 degrees of latitude; at each location, we sampled trees at four different elevations, including tree line elevation. We quantified the variation in annual tree-ring width (TRW) as a function of climate, elevation, tree age, size, annual CO2 concentrations and location, using linear mixed-effects models and interpreted TRW trends in relation to iWUE and isotope (delta C-13 and delta O-18) signalling. Results Across locations, the patterns of tree line growth occurring in the 1980-2010 period exhibited a clear and significant negative trend, in contrast to the previous 1950-1980 period. We found an increase in iWUE and delta O-18 across time and locations. Given that an increase in delta O-18 indicates a decrease in stomatal conductance, we assert that drought-induced stomatal closure appears to be causing the reduction in growth. Main conclusions We show unequivocal evidence that warmer and drier summer conditions translated into a decrease in growth rates along the elevational tree line of the southern Andes, reverting previous growth improvements linked to climate warming. An improvement in iWUE at all locations is most likely explained by decreased stomatal conductance given the rising delta O-18 signal. An iWUE-growth decoupling may act as an ecological strategy to respond to drought."
1,"To study the potential impacts of climate change on air quality and public health over the eastern United States, a coupled global/regional-scale modeling system consisting of the NASA-Goddard Institute for Space Studies Atmosphere-Ocean model, the MM5 mesoscale meteorological model and the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model for air quality has been developed. Evaluation results of the modeling system used to simulate climate and ozone air quality over the eastern United States during the five summers of 1993-1997 are presented in this paper. The results indicate that MM5 and CMAQ capture interannual and synoptic-scale variability present in surface temperature and ozone observations in the current climate, while the magnitude Of fluctuations on shorter time scales is underestimated. A comparison of observed and predicted spatial patterns of daily maximum ozone concentrations shows best performance in predicting patterns for average and above-average ozone concentrations. The frequency distributions of the duration of extreme heat and ozone events show similar features for both model predictions and observations. Finally, application of a synoptic map-typing procedure reveals that the MM5/CMAQ system succeeded in simulating the average ozone concentrations associated with several frequent pressure patterns, indicating that the effects of synoptic-scale meteorology on ozone concentrations are captured by the modeling system. It is concluded that the GCM/MM5/CMAQ system is a suitable tool for the simulation of summertime surface temperature and ozone air quality conditions over the eastern United States in the present climate.

1,"Due to anthropogenic climate change heat waves are expected to occur more frequently in the future, which might cause adverse health effects for urban population. Especially the combination of high temperatures and poor air quality impinges on the well-being of man. This accentuates the need for assessing the health risks of residents regarding air pollutants and anomalously high summer air temperatures. However, comprehensive information on the spatial and temporal distribution of temperature and particulate matter (PM) concentration in cities are presently difficult to obtain since only few measurement sites exist. In order to identify hot spots with high health risks for distinct groups of urban population, measurement campaigns were carried out, capturing the spatial distribution of temperature and PM concentrations in the City of Aachen, Germany (pop. 245,000). Several locations were selected to examine spatial influences such as topography, building density, vegetation and traffic on temperature and PM. The findings permit the detection of urban environmental variables that contribute to both temperature enhancement and poor air quality. Those variables were used as spatial predictors for the identification of possible hot spots inside and outside the area of field measurements. The zones of enhanced risks of high air temperature and PM levels were detected by means of GIS based geo-statistic modeling. These areas were mainly identified in the inner city, which is characterized by a dense building structure and heavy traffic. A chemical characterization of different PM fractions complements the GIS based investigations. The analysis of toxicologically relevant components provides information on air quality at urban, suburban and rural sites. The results of the chemical analyses support the results obtained from geo-statistical modeling. It reveals high concentrations of health relevant airborne species like metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons within the zone of enhanced risk for the coincidence of temperature stress and PM pollution.

Typically, estimated yield response models have used fixed calendar intervals to measure weather variables and omitted observations on solar radiation, an essential determinant of crop yield. A com yield response model for Illinois crop reporting districts is estimated using field data. Weather variables are timed to crop growth stages to allow use of the model if climate change shifts dates of the crop growing season. Solar radiation is included. Results show this model is superior to conventionally specified models in explaining yield variation in Illinois com."
1,"Flooding is the most common natural hazard worldwide, affecting over a billion people and costing $100 billion every year. This will likely increase in the future due to increasing population and assets in the flood-prone zones and climate change. Earth observation data have been utilized to map flooding on a global scale. This was mostly done by utilizing optical bands, as for these satellites the return period is relatively short; often daily. However, the usage of optical data can be restrictive due to e.g. cloud cover and nighttime. With synthetic aperture radar data most of these limitations can be overcome. As such, many entities now provide remotely sensed flood products, such that it becomes difficult for users to determine the best available flood data source. Here we describe the long-time development and implementation of a semi operational 'one-stop-shop' portal that contains globally scoped, flood prediction, monitoring capabilities and risk evaluations by leveraging on efforts of the entire flood community."
0,"The geographical extent of Brazil exceeds 8 5 million km(2) and encompasses a complex mix of biomes and other environmental conditions. Multiple decision support tools are needed to help support management of these diverse Brazilian natural resources including ecohydrological models. The use of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) ecohydrological watershed-scale model in Brazil has increased greatly during the past decade. Well over 100 SWAT studies were identified in this review which have been published during 1999 to 2015 in Brazilian and international journals, conference proceedings, and as theses or dissertations, many of which are written in Portuguese. The majority of these studies (102 total) are reviewed here as part of an extensive survey covering the 1999 to 2013 time period. Temporal and spatial distributions, a summary of hydrologic calibration and validation results and a synopsis of the types of applications that were performed are reported for the surveyed studies. A smaller subset of recent Brazilian studies published in English between 2012 and 2015 in scientific journals are also reviewed, with emphasis on hydrologic and sediment transport testing results as well as scenario applications that were performed. The majority of the surveyed SWAT studies was performed for watersheds located in the South and Southeast regions of Brazil (67%) and was conducted in the context of academic research. Nearly 50% of the surveyed studies reported only hydrologic results. Similar trends were found for the subset of more recent English publications. Limited studies have been reported that describe applications of SWAT in Brazil by private firms or government agencies; this review indicates that the potential exists for increased numbers of such studies in the future. However, there is evidence that a lack of accessibility to adequate quality input data is a possible hindrance to the more general use of SWAT for watershed applications in Brazil."
1,"Using panel data from 510 Brazilian micro-regions in three census years (1995, 2006 and 2017), this study presents a productivity decomposition for the Brazilian agricultural sector using stochastic production frontier methods that account for the effects of rainfall, temperature and the land suitability index. We also calculated the total factor productivity (TFP) index and decomposed it into technical efficiency, technological change, scale efficiency and environmental efficiency. This article thus provides a new and more realistic assessment of recent Brazilian agricultural productivity growth. In recent decades, Brazilian agriculture has become widely known for presenting fast productivity growth; however, our results suggest that a lower TFP growth rate than previous estimates (1.96% per annum) and the overall effects of climate change could potentially compromise Brazilian agricultural TFP growth in the long run. Our findings might thus generate insights for agricultural and regional policies to increase efficiency in the sector and promote sustainable agricultural development in Brazil, which will contribute to the sector's competitiveness in international markets, the country's social and economic welfare, and environmental conservancy."
1,"Biofuels are considered part of the potential sources of mitigation for the serious threat of global warming, by reducing human reliance on oil imported from unsafe sources at ever increasing costs. For the classic fuel supplier countries, biofuels are a source for the future, as local materials are used in their production. They generate jobs for the local population and do not require the importation of costly equipment and relevant expertise. A pioneer in the use of biofuels, Brazil has eliminated all oil imports and become energy independent. Recognising the positive effects of biofuel use, the EU and other countries are rapidly developing potential sources of their own biofuels. One of these sources could be agricultural cultures that are able to be developed under optimum conditions by endorsing and using modern and sustainable means and techniques in the rural economy. The sustainable use of the resources and the maintenance of the ecosystems in a good working order claims both the protection of the environment itself and the success of the farmers via the provision of fertility and productivity of the agricultural ecosystems, which will give them the leverage of competitiveness on the market and food safety in the long term. The paper herein intends to point out at a sustainable manner of having the economy's engine function-i. e., agriculture-by means of advocating for the efficient use of the resources within the farms and their associations, along with the support for the transition to a low-carbon economy, thanks to the progress in the bioethanol production."
1,"Due to the effect of climate change, wheat flour qualities with extremely high dough extensibility or dough strength are becoming more common, which impairs the production of selected wheat products such as pastries. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of sorghum, millet, amaranth, or buckwheat addition to such a strong gluten common wheat flour (Triticum aestivum) on its rheological and baking properties. Raw materials were analyzed chemically (ash, protein, fat, starch, total dietary fiber) and physically (water absorption index, water solubility index, and pasting properties). Selected rheological analyses (Farinograph (R) and Extensograph((R))) were carried out on wheat blends, including up to 30% alternative grains. The baking properties of the blends were evaluated on standard bread and sweet milk bread recipes. Results showed that low amounts (5%) of sorghum and millet improved the dough stability of the high-gluten wheat flour. For optimum dough extensibility, additions of 30% sorghum, 15% millet, or 20% amaranth were needed. The use of gluten-free grains increased bread volume and decreased crumb firmness of the sweet milk breads when added at lower levels (5-15%, depending on the grain). In conclusion, cereal blending is a supportive tool to mitigate the effects of ongoing climate change and can enhance biodiversity and nutrition."
1,"Excessive exploitation diminishes the capacity of natural resources to withstand environmental stress, increasing their vulnerability to extreme conditions that may trigger abrupt changes. The onset of such events depends on the coincidence of random environmental conditions and the resource state (determining its resilience). Examples include species extinction, ecosystem collapse, disease outburst and climate change induced calamities. The policy response to the catastrophic threat is measured in terms of its effect on the long-term behavior of the resource state. To that end, the L-methodology, developed originally to study autonomous systems, is extended to non-autonomous problems involving catastrophic threats."
1,"Worldwide, rising ocean temperatures are causing declines and range shifts in marine species. The direct effects of climate change on the biology of marine organisms are often well documented; yet, knowledge on the indirect effects, particularly through trophic interactions, is largely lacking. We provide evidence of ocean warming decoupling critical trophic interactions supporting a commercially important mollusc in a climate change hotspot. Dietary assessments of the Australian blacklip abalone (Haliotis rubra) indicate primary dependency on a widespread macroalgal species (Phyllospora comosa) which we show to be in state of decline due to ocean warming, resulting in abalone biomass reductions. Niche models suggest further declines in P. comosa over the coming decades and ongoing risks to H. rubra. This study highlights the importance of studies from climate change hotspots and understanding the interplay between climate and trophic interactions when determining the likely response of marine species to environmental changes."
1,"There is a strong interest in understanding how coral calcification varies with changing environmental conditions, especially given the projected changes in temperature and aragonite saturation due to climate change. This study explores in situ variation in calcification rates of Acropora downingi in the northeastern Persian Gulf relative to seasonal changes in temperature, irradiance and aragonite saturation state (Omega (arag)). Calcification rates of A. downingi were highest in the spring and lowest in the winter, and intra-annual variation in calcification rate was significantly related to temperature (r (2) = 0.30) and irradiance (r (2) = 0.36), but not Omega (arag) (r (2) = 0.02). Seasonal differences in temperature are obviously confounded by differences in other environmental conditions and vice versa. Therefore, we used published relationships from experimental studies to establish which environmental parameter(s) (temperature, irradiance, and/or Omega (arag)) placed greatest constraints on calcification rate (relative to the maximum spring rate) in each season. Variation in calcification rates was largely attributable to seasonal changes in irradiance and temperature (possibly similar to 57.4 and 39.7% respectively). Therefore, we predict that ocean warming may lead to increased rates of calcification during winter, but decelerate calcification during spring, fall and especially summer, resulting in net deceleration of calcification for A. downingi in the Persian Gulf."
1,"The green areas can produce social, environmental and economic benefits. In an urban and suburban environment, green areas can work as a buffer against the detrimental impacts of lifestyle stresses, mitigate the impact of air pollution and hot waves, as well as contribute to the conservation of biodiversity. Current studies have demonstrated that people living closer to green areas receive positive effects on mental and physical wellbeing. The aim of this study was to gain information on healthy living and wellbeing in relation with green space, among urban park goers in the city of Rome. The research was performed, by administering a questionnaire. Questionnaire -based interviews include 20 questions designed to collect information on physical and recreational activities performed and their frequencies, personal feelings about the benefit and protection of the green area. Moreover, park user characteristics (sex and age) were also recorded and how much green spaces influence their life choices. A total of 102 park goers were interviewed during summer 2015: most park users were adults (18-30 years old) males (55%). The results of this study indicate that the green area has healthy results on park users in terms of daily stress reduction and well-being perception, as well as awareness of the positive effects on air quality and mitigation of events related to climate change as the heat waves. The resulting interviews provided us useful information on perception and awareness of the positive effects of green area on mental and physical health of park users."
1,"Satellite-derived estimates of precipitation are essential to compensate for missing rainfall measurements in regions where the homogeneous and continuous monitoring of rainfall remains challenging due to low density rain gauge networks. The Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural NetworksClimate Data Record (PERSIANN-CDR) is a relatively new product (released in 2013) but that contains data since 1983, thus enabling long-term rainfall analysis. In this work, we used three decades (1983-2014) of PERSIANN-CDR daily rainfall data to characterize precipitation patterns in the southern part of the Amazon basin, which has been drastically impacted in recent decades by anthropogenic activities that exacerbate the spatio-temporal variability of rainfall regimes. We computed metrics for the rainy season (onset date, demise date and duration) on a pixel-to-pixel basis for each year in the time series. We identified significant trends toward a shortening of the rainy season in the southern Amazon, mainly linked to earlier demise dates. This work thus contributes to monitoring possible signs of climate change in the region and to assessing uncertainties in rainfall trends and their potential impacts on human activities and natural ecosystems."
1,"The main challenge of evaluating droughts in the context of climate change and linking these droughts to adverse societal outcomes is a lack of a uniform definition that identifies drought conditions at a location and time. The U.S. Drought Monitor (USDM), created in 1999, is a well-established composite index that combines drought indicators across the hydrological cycle (i.e., meteorological to hydrological) with information from local experts. This makes the USDM one of the most holistic measures for evaluating past drought conditions across the United States. In this study, the USDM was used to define drought events as consecutive periods in time where the USDM status met or exceeded D1 conditions over the past 20 years. This analysis was applied to 5 km grid cells covering the U.S. and Puerto Rico to characterize the frequency, duration, and intensification rates of drought, and the timing of onset, amelioration, and other measures for every drought event on record. Results from this analysis revealed stark contrasts in the evolution of drought across the United States. Over the western United States, droughts evolved much slower, resulting in longer-lasting but fewer droughts. The eastern United States experienced more frequent, shorter-duration events. Given the slower evolution from onset to drought peak, flash droughts, which made up 9.8% of all droughts, were less common across the western United States, with a greater frequency over the southern United States. The most severe drought event on record was the 2012 drought, when more than 21% of the United States experienced its largest number of weeks at or above extreme (D3) drought conditions. The availability of historical drought events would support future societal impacts studies relating drought to adverse outcomes and aid in the evaluation of mitigation strategies by providing a dataset to local decision makers to compare and evaluate past droughts."
1,"Historical data suggest that many bee species have declined in body size. Larger-bodied bees with narrow phenological and dietary breadth are most prone to declines in body size over time. This may be especially true in solitary, desert-adapted species that are vulnerable to climate change such as Centris pallida (Hymenoptera: Apidae). In addition, body size changes in species with size-linked behaviours could threaten the prevalence of certain behavioural phenotypes long-term. C. pallida solitary bees are found in the Sonoran Desert. Males use alternative reproductive tactics (ARTs) and are dimorphic in both morphology and behaviour. C. pallida male body size has been studied since the 1970s in the same population. The authors collected body size data in 2022 and combined it with published records from 1974-2022. The authors find a persistent decline in the mean head width of patrolling males, and shifts towards smaller body sizes in the populations of males found foraging and hovering. Both morphs declined in average body size, and the proportion of large-morph males in the population decreased by 8%. Mating males did not decline in mean body size over the last five decades. The authors discuss hypotheses related to the decline in C. pallida male head width. Finally, the authors advocate for C. pallida as an excellent study system for understanding the stability of ARTs with size-linked behavioural phenotypes."
1,"The implications of climate change coupled with anthropogenic activity on water resources have caused great concern, particularly in areas vulnerable to water stress such as sub-Saharan Africa. We focused on the future magnitude of food loss (FL) in African regions, using an ARIMAX model to fit and forecast roots & tubers (R&T) losses of five major crops cultivated in Africa regions, including cassava, potato, sweet potato, yam, and other roots & tubers. The forecast was done up to 2025 under the influence of five exogenous variables, namely, gross domestic product, harvested area, precipitation, temperature, and food production. In addition, the future crop water requirement (CWR) of production under climatic variables, and the associated water loss embodied in FL were quantified by means of CROPWAT 8.0. Our findings showed that in 2025 the magnitude of FL is expected to increase by 19.06%, 104.78%, and 27.72% at 2013 levels for East Africa, Middle, and West Africa, respectively. Under future climate the CWR of the selected crops is expected to be higher in West Africa (1790.24 m(3)/tonne), than in East (989.03 m3/tonne), and Middle Africa (903.64 m3/tonne). The future water loss embodied in FL is expected to be 114.37, 112.80, and 12.06 m(3)/cap/yr for the West, Middle, and East Africa regions, respectively. Our results show that measures aimed at preventing FL will also alleviate pressure on available water resources."
0,"Palaeoenvironments and former climates are typically inferred from pollen and macrofossil records. This approach is time-consuming and suffers from low taxonomic resolution and biased taxon sampling. Here, we test an alternative DNA-based approach utilizing the P6 loop in the chloroplast trnL (UAA) intron; a short (13-158 bp) and variable region with highly conserved flanking sequences. For taxonomic reference, a whole trnL intron sequence database was constructed from recently collected material of 842 species, representing all widespread and/or ecologically important taxa of the species-poor arctic flora. The P6 loop alone allowed identification of all families, most genera (> 75%) and one-third of the species, thus providing much higher taxonomic resolution than pollen records. The suitability of the P6 loop for analysis of samples containing degraded ancient DNA from a mixture of species is demonstrated by high-throughput parallel pyrosequencing of permafrost-preserved DNA and reconstruction of two plant communities from the last glacial period. Our approach opens new possibilities for DNA-based assessment of ancient as well as modern biodiversity of many groups of organisms using environmental samples."
1,"Over the last 200 years, conversion of non-cultivated land for agriculture has substantially reduced global soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in upper soil layers. Nevertheless, practices such as no- or reduced tillage, application of organic soil amendments, and maintenance of continuous cover can increase SOC in agricultural fields. While these management practices have been well studied, the effects on SOC of cropping systems that incorporate irrigation are poorly understood. Given the large, and expanding, agricultural landbase under irrigation across the globe, this is a critical knowledge gap for climate change mitigation. We undertook a systematic literature review and subsequent meta-analysis of data from studies that examined changes in SOC on irrigated agricultural sites through time. We investigated changes in SOC by climate (aridity), soil texture, and irrigation method with the following objectives: (i) to examine the impact of irrigated agriculture on SOC storage; and (ii) to identify the conditions under which irrigated agriculture is most likely to enhance SOC. Overall, irrigated agriculture increased SOC stocks by 5.9%, with little effect of study length (2-47 years). However, changes in SOC varied by climate and soil depth, with the greatest increase in SOC observed on irrigated semi-arid sites at the 0-10 cm depth (14.8%). Additionally, SOC increased in irrigated fine- and medium-textured soils but not coarse-textured soils. Furthermore, while there was no overall change to SOC in flood/furrow irrigated sites, SOC tended to increase in sprinkler irrigated sites, and decrease in drip irrigated sites, especially at depths below 10 cm. This work sheds light on the nuances of SOC change across irrigated agricultural systems, highlights the importance of studying SOC storage in deeper soils, and will help guide future research on the impacts of irrigated agriculture on SOC."
1,"Considered a unique biodiversity hotspot of the world, the Sundarbans mangrove harbours a wide variety of wild and plant species. This popular tiger land is now under threat to tiger survival. In this study, I venture to assess the tiger status, population, trends, extent, threats, and conservation process in the Sundarbans. My study finds that there were nearly 693 Bengal tigers (Panthera tigris tigris) in the Sundarbans mangrove forest in 2004. Ten years later, the tiger population reached 182 individuals. However, a slight increase in the tiger number was noticed in 2018 when the tiger constituted 202 individuals. Due to data deficiency, TX2 goal of doubling the tiger population by 2022 was not considered. This study finds that there are numerous factors work behind the extinction of the tiger population in the Sundarbans, such as habitat loss, deforestation, land cover change, human interventions into the forests, poaching, hunting, illegal wildlife trade, climate change, and natural disasters, salinity, scarcity of prey species, lack of capability of the forest staff and personnel, poor and weak legal frameworks are prominent. Therefore, this paper endeavours to assess the efforts of Bangladesh and the Indian government to double the Bengal tiger population by 2022 and analyse the factors and threats to eliminate tiger numbers in the world's largest mangrove forest Sundarbans."
1,"Superfund sites could affect life expectancy (LE) via increasing the likelihood of exposure to toxic chemicals. Here, we assess to what extent such presence could alter the LE independently and in the context of sociodemographic determinants. A nationwide geocoded statistical modeling at the census tract level was undertaken to estimate the magnitude of impact. Results showed a significant difference in LE among census tracts with at least one Superfund site and their neighboring tracts with no sites. The presence of a Superfund site could cause a decrease of -0.1860.027 years in LE. This adverse effect could be as high as -1.22 years in tracts with Superfund sites and high sociodemographic disadvantage. Specific characteristics of Superfund sites such as being prone to flooding and the absence of a cleanup strategy could amplify the adverse effect. Furthermore, the presence of Superfund sites amplifies the negative influence of sociodemographic factors at lower LEs. Superfund sites have hazardous wastes that could affect the health of those who live near them, but this has not been assessed across the USA. Here the authors find that proximity to superfund sites decreases life expectancy and is further exacerbated by sociodemographic and climate change factors."
1,"The global total of protected areas to conserve biodiversity is increasing steadily, while numerous studies show that they are broadly effective. That said, how will current conservation strategies work, given the current and expected changes to the global climate? The giant panda is a conservation icon and exceptional efforts protect its remaining habitats. It provides a unique case study to address this question. There are many studies on the projected loss of habitats as climate warms, but few consider the geographical arrangement of future habitats, current protected area, and species' dispersal abilities. Most alarmingly, we expect much greater habitat fragmentation after climate change. Here, we combine long-term data on giant pandas with climate-change scenarios to predict future habitat loss and distribution in the Min Shan of Sichuan and Gansu, China. We employ metapopulation capacity as a mechanistic measure of a species' response to habitat fragmentation. The results show that climate changes will lead to 16.3 +/- 1.4 (%) losses of giant panda habitats. Alarmingly, 11.4% of the remaining habitat fragments would be smaller than the extinction threshold area as the extent of fragmentation increases nearly fourfold. The projected fragmentation of giant panda habitats predicts 9% lower effectiveness inside the protected area network compared with that outside of reserves. A 35% reduction will occur in future effectiveness of reserve networks. The results challenge the long-term effectiveness of protected areas in protecting the species' persistence. They indicate a need for integrating both natural processes and dynamic threats over a simple reliance on individual static natural reserves. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
1,"Mangrove wetlands are among the most productive and carbon-dense ecosystems in the world. Their structural attributes vary considerably across spatial scales, yielding large uncertainties in regional and global estimates of carbon stocks. Here, we present a global analysis of mangrove canopy height gradients and aboveground carbon stocks based on remotely sensed measurements and field data. Our study highlights that precipitation, temperature and cyclone frequency explain 74% of the global trends in maximum canopy height, with other geophysical factors influencing the observed variability at local and regional scales. We find the tallest mangrove forests in Gabon, equatorial Africa, where stands attain 62.8 m. The total global mangrove carbon stock (above- and belowground biomass, and soil) is estimated at 5.03 Pg, with a quarter of this value stored in Indonesia. Our analysis implies sensitivity of mangrove structure to climate change, and offers a baseline to monitor national and regional trends in mangrove carbon stocks."
1,"Wide carbonate platform environments developed on the western passive margin of the Tethys during the Late Triassic, after a major climate change (Carnian Pluvial Episode) that produced a crisis of high-relief microbial carbonate platforms. The peritidal succession of this epicontinental platform (Dolomia Principale/Hauptdolomit, Dachstein Limestone) is widespread in the Mediterranean region. However, the start-up stage is not fully understood. The original platform to basin depositional geometries of the system have been studied in the north-eastern Southern Alps, close to the Italian/Slovenian boundary where they are exceptionally preserved. Sedimentological features have been investigated in detail by measuring several stratigraphic sections cropping out along an ideal depositional profile. The analysis of the facies architecture allowed reconstruction of the palaeoenvironments of the Dolomia Principale platform during its start-up and early growth stages in the late Carnian. The carbonate platform was characterized by an outer platform area, connected northward to steep slopes facing a relatively deep basin. Southward, the outer platform was connected to inner sheltered environments by a narrow, often emerged shelf crest. Behind this zone, carbonate sedimentation occurred in shallow lagoons and tidal flats, passing inward to a siliciclastic mudflat. The Dolomia Principale platform was initially aggrading and able to keep pace with a concomitant sea-level rise, and then prograding during the late Carnian. This stratigraphic interval was correlated with the Tuvalian succession of the Dolomites, allowing depiction of the depositional system on a wide scale of hundreds of kilometres. This large-scale depositional system presents features in common with some Palaeozoic and Mesozoic carbonate build-ups (for example, the Permian Capitan Reef complex, Anisian Latemar platform), both in terms of architecture and prevailing carbonate producers. A microbial-dominated carbonate factory is found in the outer platform and upper slope. The recovery of high-relief microbial carbonate platforms marks the end of the Carnian Pluvial Episode in the Tuvalian of Tethys."
0,"The snow leopard Panthera uncia has declined due to habitat loss, habitat fragmentation and human persecution. Predator distribution is heavily dependent on prey species availability and distribution. With increasing pressures from farming practices encroaching into native species range and persecution of snow leopards in response to livestock depredation, it is vital to assess current predator and prey species distribution to highlight sensitive areas of overlap for protection. This study uses MaxEnt, a presence-only Species Distribution Model (SDM) to assess snow leopard and four prey species habitat suitability along the southern and eastern borders of Kazakhstan using environmental data. This area is considered an important corridor between snow leopard populations in the north and south of their range. Each of the five SDM's produced models of 'good' discriminating abilities. We then compared the potential niche overlap between snow leopard and four prey species using ENMTools to highlight areas of important niche overlap within the corridor. The results indicated a very high degree of overlap between snow leopard and Siberian ibex Capra sibirica and high degrees with red deer Cervus elaphus, argali Ovis ammon and urial Ovis onentalis. The snow leopard population in this region is also found to be using forested areas below 2500 m, much lower than recorded in other areas of their range. The results highlight areas needed for protection but also pose additional conservation questions regarding the importance of prey species to transitory individuals."
1,"Due to the pressures imposed by climate change, the European Union (EU) has been forced to design several initiatives (the Common Agricultural Policy, the European Green Deal, Farm to Fork) to tackle the climate crisis and ensure food security. Through these initiatives, the EU aspires to mitigate the adverse effects of the climate crisis and achieve collective prosperity for humans, animals, and the environment. The adoption or promotion of crops that would facilitate the attaining of these objectives is naturally of high importance. Flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) is a multipurpose crop with many applications in the industrial, health, and agri-food sectors. This crop is mainly grown for its fibers or its seed and has recently gained increasing attention. The literature suggests that flax can be grown in several parts of the EU, and potentially has a relatively low environmental impact. The aim of the present review is to: (i) briefly present the uses, needs, and utility of this crop and, (ii) assess its potential within the EU by taking into account the sustainability goals the EU has set via its current policies."
1,"BACKGROUND: Several heat indices have been developed in industrial health, but each has its limitations. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this article is to determine the validity and applicability of a temperature-humidity index, named Humidex compared with the Standard Wet-Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) index (ISO 7243). METHOD: This cross-sectional study was conducted in the summer of 2019, in a tile factory in the west of Iran. 59 measurements were performed in 8 different workstations. Environmental parameters including natural wet bulb temperature (Tnw), dry bulb temperature (Ta), globe bulb temperature (Tg), and heat stress (WBGT) were measured. Humidex was calculated according to an equation. SPSS software (version 16) was used for data analysis. RESULTS: There was a high correlation between Humidex and WBGT in the estimation of heat stress (R=0.912, P<0.001). The Kappa Coefficient between Humidex and WBGT was 0.298, P=0.001. CONCLUSION: Humidex is highly correlated with WBGT. Humidex can be used instead of the WBGT index, especially in hot and humid environments."
1,"Conifer forests worldwide are becoming increasingly vulnerable to attacks by bark beetles and their fungal associates due to the effects of global warming. Attack by the bark beetle Ips typographus and the blue-stain fungus it vectors (Endoconidiophora polonica) on Norway spruce (Picea abies) is well known to induce increased production of terpene oleoresin and polyphenolic compounds. However, it is not clear whether specific compounds are important in resisting attack. In this study, we observed a significant increase in dihydroflavonol and flavan-3-ol content after inoculating Norway spruce with the bark beetle vectored fungus. A bioassay revealed that the dihydroflavonol taxifolin and the flavan-3-ol catechin negatively affected both I. typographus and E. polonica. The biosynthesis of flavan-3-ols is well studied in Norway spruce, but little is known about dihydroflavonol formation in this species. A flavanone-3-hydroxylase (F3H) was identified that catalyzed the conversion of eriodictyol to taxifolin and was highly expressed after E. polonica infection. Down-regulating F3H gene expression by RNA interference in transgenic Norway spruce resulted in significantly lower levels of both dihydroflavonols and flavan-3-ols. Therefore F3H plays a key role in the biosynthesis of defense compounds in Norway spruce that act against the bark beetle-fungus complex. This enzyme forms a defensive product, taxifolin, which is also a metabolic precursor of another defensive product, catechin, which in turn synergizes the toxicity of taxifolin to the bark beetle associated fungus."
1,"Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a pollutant of concern in urban areas around the world. The main sources in urban environments are related to the burning of fuel and include transportation, electricity generation, and industrial and residential activities. From a public health perspective NO2 has also been widely associated with respiratory disease, including asthma exacerbation. NO2 also plays a key role in ground-level concentrations of ozone (O-3), which is also a public health concern. This policy brief explores the relationships between transportation, climate change mitigation and ambient levels of air pollutants such as NO2. The Covid-19 pandemic has offered a glimpse of how rapid changes in transportation use can result in significant decreases in NO2 concentrations. Data from New York City supports this relationship. Transportation policies aimed at reducing traffic offer an opportunity to both mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality. The implementation of measures to rethink public space and the use of streets in response to Covid-19 also provides insights into an additional policy alternative to achieve these goals."
0,"This article argues that the time has arrived for leisure and consumerism to become key objects of study for a twenty-first century critical criminology. As global capitalism struggles to sustain itself, it is creating myriad crises in areas such as climate change, mental health, personal debt, and unemployment. Using a zemiological lens, we argue that it is on the field of commodified leisure and consumerism that criminologists can see these meta-crises of liberal capitalism unfold. Therefore, this article positions the burgeoning deviant leisure perspective as a new and distinct form of twenty-first critical criminologyone that departs from traditional criminological approaches to leisure rooted in the sociology of deviance in favor of critical criminology's recent zemiological turn to social harm. In doing so, this article outlines how the deviant leisure perspective's emergence at the intersection of zemiology, green criminology and ultra-realist criminological theory enables it to address some of the realities of our times, as well as how the deviant leisure perspective can help explain the normalized harms that emanate from the relationship between commodified leisure and consumer capitalism."
1,"This study investigated simultaneous flood risk among all the 109 class-A river basins over Japan using the big data of (over 1000 years) annual maximum hourly flow simulated from a large ensemble climate simulation database for policy decision making for future climate change, and proposed a novel approach in its geospatial analysis by applying two informatics techniques: the association rule analysis and graph theory. Frequency analysis of the number of rivers with the annual maximum flow over the flow capacity in the same year (defined as simultaneous flooding here) indicated that simultaneous flood risk will increase in the future climate under 4-degree rise scenarios in Japan, whose increment is larger than the variation of sea surface temperature projections. As the result, the return period of simultaneous flooding in eight river basins (the same number as in a severe storm in western Japan, 2018, causing the second worst economic damage since 1962) is estimated at 400 years in the historical experiment, 25 years in the 4-degree rise experiment. The association rule and graph theory analyses for the big data of annual maximum flows in the future climate scenarios indicated that simultaneous flood occurrence is dominated by spatial distance at a national scale as well as by the spatial relation between mountainous ridges and typhoon courses at a regional scale. Large ensemble climate simulation data combined with the informatics technology is a powerful approach to simultaneous flood risk analysis."
1,"Global climate change, especially extreme drought events, presents a complicated challenge to humanity and Earth's system in the 21st century. As an extremely important carbon sink region in China, Southwest China has encountered frequent drought disasters in recent decades. It is critical to explore the frequency, duration, severity, and other associated characteristics of drought events as well as their spatial and temporal patterns in the region from a long-term perspective. In this study, we used the latest dataset from the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) between 1901 and 2018 to extract all drought events by calculating the standardized anomaly of the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). Theil-Sen median trend analysis, the Mann-Kendall test, and the moving t-test were used to reveal the spatial trend and mutation point of drought severity. The results showed that (1) The standardized anomaly of the 3-month SPEI can accurately identify drought events in Southwest China. In total, 72 drought events occurred during this period, of which the consecutive drought in autumn, winter, and spring from 2009 to 2010 lasted the longest, having the most substantial severity and the most extensive damage range. (2) Drought events mainly started in spring and early summer and ended in autumn and winter. The distribution of drought was the most expansive and the drought severity was the most serious in September. (3) In terms of spatial pattern, Guangxi has the highest frequency of drought events, with some areas experiencing up to 100 events. The average duration of drought events ranged between 3.5 and 5.5 months, with most lasting for 4-5 months. The most severe drought areas are mainly concentrated in southern Sichuan and western Yunnan. Overall, the severity of drought events in the west were generally higher compared to that in the east. (4) Over the past 120 years, most of the region (82.46%) showed an increasing trend in drought severity, with a slope of up to -0.01. About 15.12% of the areas exhibited a significant drying trend (p < 0.05), particularly in southern Sichuan, eastern Guizhou, and northern and southern Yunnan. Such analyses can serve as a scientific foundation for developing drought prevention and mitigation measures as well as exploring how drought events affect the structure and function of terrestrial ecosystems in Southwest China."
1,"Antarctic glacial meltwater is thought to play an important role in determining large-scale Southern Ocean climate trends, yet recent modeling efforts have proceeded without a good understanding of how its vertical distribution in the water column is set. To rectify this, here we conduct new large-eddy simulations of the ascent of a buoyant meltwater plume after its escape from beneath an Antarctic ice shelf. We find that the meltwater's settling depth is primarily a function of the buoyancy forcing per unit width of the source and the ambient stratification, consistent with the classical theory of turbulent buoyant plumes and in contrast to previous work that suggested an important role for centrifugal instability. Our results further highlight the significant role played by localized variability in stratification; this helps explain observed interannual variability in the vertical meltwater distribution near Pine Island Glacier. Because of the vast heterogeneity in mass loss rates and ambient conditions at different Antarctic ice shelves, a dynamic parameterization of meltwater settling depth may be crucial for accurately simulating high-latitude climate in a warming world; we discuss how this may be developed following this work, and where the remaining challenges lie."
1,"A better understanding of abrupt ecosystem changes is needed to improve prediction of future ecosystem states under climate change. Chronological analysis based on long-term monitoring data is an effective way to estimate the fre-quency and magnitude of abrupt ecosystem changes. In this study, we used abrupt-change detection to differentiate changes of algal community composition in two Japanese lakes and to identify the causes of long-term ecological tran-sitions. Additionally, we focused on finding statistically significant relationships between abrupt changes to aid with factor analysis. To estimate the strengths of driver-response relationships underlying abrupt algal transitions, the timing of the algal transitions was compared to that of abrupt changes in climate and basin characteristics to identify any synchronicities between them. The timing of abrupt algal changes in the two study lakes corresponded most closely to that of heavy runoff events during the past 30-40 years. This strongly suggests that changes in the frequency of extreme events (e.g., heavy rain, prolonged drought) have a greater effect on lake chemistry and community com-position than do shifts in the means of climate and basin factors. Our analysis of synchronicity (with a focus on time lags) could provide an easy method to identify better adaptative strategies for future climate change."
1,"The ichthyoplankton assemblage in the Atlantic region off the NW Iberian peninsula (AR) and in the southern Bay of Biscay (SBB) and the response of the larval fish species distribution to the relatively rapidly changing hydrographic conditions in spring 2010 were studied using two ichthyoplankton cruises. The SBB showed a more abundant and diverse ichthyoplankton assemblage than the AR, although the larval fish assemblage (LFA) was structured into on-shelf and off-shelf assemblages in both regions. Inter-sampling variability related to downwelling/upwelling regimes was observed in the cross-shelf assemblage distribution in the SBB but not in the AR. This suggests that LFA distributions in the area of this study are good indicators of downwelling and weak coastal upwelling regimes but not of relatively strong coastal upwelling or upwelling filaments. Although depth was identified by multivariate analyses as being the most important variable explaining larval fish species distributions, a shelf-breakfront in the SBB and the surface offshore (onshore) flows associated with coastal downwelling (upwelling) in the AR seems to have been key in defining and maintaining assemblage boundaries. Results of this study should also encourage marine research institutions to use routine ichthyoplankton sampling to monitor fish communities and their responses to global warming."
1,"In recent years, the increased intensity and duration of droughts have dramatically altered the structure and function of grassland ecosystems, which have been forced to adapt to this change in climate. Combinations of global change drivers such as elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration, warming, nitrogen (N) deposition, grazing, and land-use change have influenced the impact that droughts have on grassland C cycling. This influence, to some extent, can modify the relationship between droughts and grassland carbon (C) cycling in the multi-factor world. Unfortunately, prior reviews have been primarily anecdotal from the 1930s to the 2010s. We investigated the current state of the study on the interactive impacts of multiple factors under drought scenarios in grassland C cycling and provided scientific advice for dealing with droughts and managing grassland C cycling in a multi-factor world. Currently, adequate information is not available on the interaction between droughts and global change drivers, which would advance our understanding of grassland C cycling responses. It was determined that future experiments and models should specifically test how droughts regulate grassland C cycling under global changes. Previous multi-factor experiments of current and future global change conditions have studied various drought scenarios poorly, including changes in precipitation frequency and amplitude, timing, and interactions with other global change drivers. Multi-factor experiments have contributed to quantifying these potential changes and have provided important information on how water affects ecosystem processes under global change. There is an urgent need to establish a systematic framework that can assess ecosystem dynamic responses to droughts under current and future global change and human activity, with a focus on the combined effects of droughts, global change drivers, and the corresponding hierarchical responses of an ecosystem."
1,"There is increasing evidence that exposure to weather-related hazards like storms and floods adversely affects mental health. However, evidence of treated and untreated mental disorders based on diagnostic criteria for the general population is limited. We analysed the Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey, a large probability sample survey of adults in England (n = 7525), that provides the only national data on the prevalence of mental disorders assessed to diagnostic criteria. The most recent survey (2014-2015) asked participants if they had experienced damage to their home (due to wind, rain, snow or flood) in the six months prior to interview, a period that included months of unprecedented population exposure to flooding, particularly in Southern England. One in twenty (4.5%) reported living in a storm- or flood-damaged home in the previous six months. Social advantage (home ownership, higher household income) increased the odds of exposure to storm or flood damage. Exposure predicted having a common mental disorder over and above the effects of other known predictors of poor mental health. With climate change increasing the frequency and severity of storms and flooding, improving community resilience and disaster preparedness is a priority. Evidence on the mental health of exposed populations is key to building this capacity."
1,"Climate change has been intensifying soil drying and rewetting cycles, which can alter the soil microbiome structure and activity. Here we hypothesized that a soil drying-rewetting cycle enhances biodegradation and, hence, decreases the effectiveness of nitrification inhibitors (NIs). The effectiveness of DMPP (3,4-Dimethylpyrazole phosphate) and MP + TZ (3-Methylpyrazol and Triazol) was evaluated in 60-day incubation studies under a drying and rewetting cycle relative to constant low and high soil moisture conditions (40% and 80% water-holding capacity, WHC, respectively) in two different textured soils. The measurements included (i) daily and cumulative N2O-N emissions, (ii) soil NH4+-N and NO3--N concentrations, and (iii) the composition of bacterial soil communities. Application of DMPP and MP + TZ reduced the overall N2O-N emissions under drying-rewetting (-45%), as well as under 40% WHC (-39%) and 80% WHC (-25%). DMPP retarded nitrification and decreased N2O-N release from the sandy and silt loam soils, while MP + TZ mitigated N2O-N production only from the silt loam soil. Unexpectedly, between days 30 and 60, N2O-N emissions from NI-treated soils increased by up to fivefold relative to the No-NI treatment in the silt loam soil at 80% WHC. Likewise, the relative abundance of the studied nitrifying bacteria indicated that the NIs had only short-term effectiveness in the silt loam soil. These results suggested that DMPP and MP + TZ might trigger high N2O-N release from fine-textured soil with constant high moisture after this short-term inhibitory effect. In conclusion, DMPP and MP + TZ effectively reduce N2O-N emissions under soil drying and rewetting."
1,"Biodiversity is structured in space and time, yet our understanding about the temporal variation of biological communities is still limited. Recent work suggests that temporal beta diversity should be lowest in unpredictable systems with low seasonality, as expected for tropical ecosystems. However, this hypothesis remains largely unexplored. Here, we analysed the temporal dynamics of Atlantic Forest coastal stream caddisfly assemblages sampled simultaneously along four years, resulting in 99 unique site-time combinations. Given that the region we studied is expected to have low climatic seasonality and low environmental harshness, we expected to find: (1) unseasonal variation in community composition; (2) equal contribution of nestedness and turnover to beta diversity; (3) weak correlation between variation in community composition and in environmental variables; and (4) temporal beta diversity similar to that expected by neutral dynamics. Using wavelet analysis we found that, in spite of general temperature stability, precipitation was highly seasonal but unpredictable at the monthly scale. We found high temporal beta diversity, with a larger contribution of nestedness due to an overall decrease in abundance and diversity during months characterised by heavy rain events. We also found that community composition was moderately structured in space, suggesting that both local in-stream characteristics and dispersal limitation drive community reassembly after heavy rain events. Null model analysis indicated that observed short-term beta diversity was not distinct from that expected by chance (i.e. produced by null simulations). This suggests an important role of stochastic colonisation and dispersal limitation in the temporal organisation of Atlantic Forest stream assemblages. Since heavy rain events strongly disassemble communities that are then randomly recolonised, and considering the current scenario of climate change, increased extreme events of precipitation could lead to unpredictable changes in biodiversity in tropical regions."
0,"Critical ecological areas (CEAs), as important regions for biodiversity and ecosystem functions, are crucial for ecological conservation and environmental management at regional and global scales. However, the methodology and framework of CEA identification have not been well established. In this study, a comprehensive CEA identification method was developed based on the ecosystem multifunctionality-stability-integrity framework by using K-means clustering, critical slowing down theory and possible connectivity. Taking the Yellow River basin (YRB) as a case study, our results showed that ecosystem multifunctionality gradually decreased from the southeast to northwest. A decrease in ecosystem stability was observed since 2017 and was mainly due to the increased impacts of human activities and urbanization within the 10-20 km distance threshold from the ecosystem. Based on the proposed framework, 15.13% of the YRB was identified as CEAs with reliable estimates, and most areas were distributed in the Three-River Headwaters, Qinling and Taihang Mountains. Moreover, urbanization and precipitation were found to be the dominant environmental factors affecting the CEA distri-bution in the YRB. Our results indicated that the proposed framework could provide a comprehensive approach for CEA identification and useful implications for ecological conservation and environmental management."
0,"Plantation mapping is important for understanding deforestation and climate change. Most existing plantation products rely heavily on visual interpretation of satellite imagery, which results in both false positives and false negatives. In this paper we aim to design an automatic framework that map plantations in large regions. Conventional classification methods cannot be directly applied due to the lack of ground-truth data. To this end, we propose a novel method that learns from multiple imperfect annotators. Since each annotator's labeling accuracy varies across different land covers due to his expertise and reference imagery, we model the annotator's reliability level to be associated with different types of locations. On the other hand, the temporal variation of land covers also greatly impacts the performance of conventional learning model. Therefore we utilize the remote sensing data which are available at multiple periods of a year and extend our proposed method by incorporating multi-instance learning. Finally, we show the superiority of the proposed method over multiple baselines in both synthetic dataset and real-world dataset. In addition, through several case studies we demonstrate that our method can achieve a better balance of precision and recall than the existing plantation products."
1,"Anthropogenic climate change is one of the main current threats to biodiversity, and it has been linked to species decline. Bats deserve attention because they occupy different trophic niches and perform different functions in nature, acting as flower pollinators (nectarivores), seed dispersers (frugivores), and pest controllers (insectivores). The effects of climate change on the distribution of bat species occurring in the Carajas National Forest (Eastern Amazon, southeastern Path state, Brazil) was examined by modeling species distributions. A total of 83 species of bats providing the above mentioned services were analyzed for the years 2050 and 2070 to answer the following two questions: (i) Which species are potentially more sensitive to climate changes and will not be able to find suitable areas in Carajas in the future, and (ii) Which are the priority areas that protect the greatest number of species from climate change. Of the total species analyzed, 47 (57%) will potentially not find suitable areas in Carajas under the scenarios employed. Pollinators, seed dispersers, and more-generalist (omnivorous) bats will potentially be the most affected, suffering a 28-36% decrease in suitable area under the 2070 scenario, which may have implications for the plants with which those species interact. According to the scenarios employed, the Carajas National Forest, as well as other conservation units in Path, will not protect most species in the future. The most suitable areas are located mainly to the north and west of the state and under varying degrees of conservation: from well-preserved protected areas to areas degraded due to different anthropogenic impacts. This study emphasizes that the possible effect of climate change and the location of species protection areas need to be analyzed together to ensure that the areas that will act as potential climate refuges for species in the future are indeed protected."
1,"Flood occurred in the Melamchi River on June 15 and recurred on July 31, 2021 have led notorious impacts in Nepal. This study has investigated these extreme flood events and their nexus with climate i.e. precipitation and temperature. The available daily and hourly hydro-meteorological data were analyzed. The regional flow during both flood events were estimated using 1-D hydraulic HEC-HMS model and the correlation among rainfall -runoff, temperature with snow water equivalent were examined. Result show that the Melamchi region found an average annual rainfall of 2610 mm during 1992-2021. Specifically, the middle section i.e. Shermathang and Tarkeghang has observed the highest daily average rainfall of 26.8 mm and 39.2 mm during the first and 61.4 mm and 66.6 mm during the second flood event, respectively. The discharge found at the Melamchi town segment was at 2893 m3/s and 1105 m3/s in the first and second events respectively in which regional contribution into discharge were found significant. The Bhemathang, which is landslide damming area where The daily average discharge observed 357 m3/s and 76 m3/s on both events, respectively. At the Nakote, the rainfall and runoff are poorly correlated while snow water equivalent and temperature showed positive correlation during summer. The snowmelt contribution to discharge was found 9.68 m3/s in the Melamchi River during the Summer season. The regional contribution to discharge and spatial variations of precipitation during flooding events showed that precipitation is the main climatic driver while temporary damming and increasing temperature also contributes to the magnitude of the of the Melamchi flood."
1,"The availability of online biodiversity data has increased in recent decades, aiding our understanding of diversity patterns and species richness-environment relationships across temporal and spatial scales. However, even the most exhaustive databases are prone to sampling biases, which create knowledge gaps in species distributions and increase uncertainty in model predictions. Regarding marine environments, intertidal zones are globally distributed and considered early warning systems for climate change impacts and species' range shifts. Owing to their relative accessibility, intertidal records should - supposedly - be less incomplete and biased compared to open-ocean and deep-sea areas. Yet, the extent and coverage of intertidal records available in global biodiversity databases remains unknown. In this study, we used a high-resolution worldwide tidal flat map to identify intertidal records of 11 563 benthic species from the OBIS (Ocean Biodiversity Information System) portal. Following a thorough data-cleaning process, we evaluated geographic patterns in observed species richness, site accessibility, sampling effort, and inventory completeness across latitudes. We demonstrate that observed species richness has mid-latitudinal peaks while the tropics accumulate species with missing records, similar to patterns described for the entire marine realm. These patterns correlate with disproportionate mid-latitude sampling efforts and poor tropical sampling coverage. Sixty-five percent of the mapped intertidal sites are located within 3 hours of a city, but sampling records remain almost absent along African Atlantic, South American Pacific, and Indo-Pacific coasts. Thus, even for the accessible and well-studied intertidal shorelines, database records are not free from geographical biases and their associated implications for biodiversity estimates. Our results highlight the need for a better data-sharing culture, and we hope to encourage initiatives promoting more and better-distributed research efforts on intertidal biodiversity, which could improve global scale detection and prediction of climate change impacts at regional and global scales."
0,"Aim Given that riverine systems exhibit longitudinal environmental gradients from headwater to the mouth of a river, habitat heterogeneity appears to be a major driver of spatial variation in community composition among riverine localities. As freshwater ecosystems are amongst the most endangered ecosystems in the world, community-based conservation and multiple-species management are necessary to maintain ecosystem integrity. We used joint species distribution models (JSDMs) to investigate the relative importance of abiotic and biotic factors that are responsible for the distribution and co-occurrence of species in riverine ecosystems. Location Central and northern Europe. Methods We examined the general patterns of species assemblage of two endangered freshwater mussel species (Margaritifera margaritifera and Unio crassus) and their associated fish communities. We examined the patterns of positive or negative co-occurrence in mussel and fish species and identified shared abiotic responses between mussel-host pairs. Results We found that the relative importance of abiotic and residual factors and patterns of significant species correlations varied among taxa: significant residual correlations were prevalent among fish species, whereas mussel occurrences were exclusively explained by abiotic factors. Mussels and their fish hosts generally had shared abiotic responses with some mismatched responses between mussel-host pairs. Main conclusions Given that the composition of communities were tightly linked with abiotic factors and residual correlations, the results have significant implications for the conservation and restoration of aquatic communities. This study highlights the necessity to simultaneously consider environmental factors and species co-occurrences in the modelling of species distributions and assemblages of riverine communities. Such a holistic community conservation approach can reveal ecological similarities and differences among species, which can help us avoid conflicts among target-species conservation plans."
1,"Historical geological and climatic events are the most important drivers of population expansions/contractions, range shifts, and interspecific divergence in plants. However, the species divergence and spatiotemporal population dynamics of alpine cold-tolerant herbal plants in the high-altitude Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) and adjacent areas remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated population evolutionary history of four endangered Notopterygium herb species in the QTP and adjacent regions. We sequenced 10 nuclear loci, 2 mitochondrial DNA regions, and 4 chloroplast DNA regions in a total of 72 natural populations from the 4 species, and tested the hypothesis that the population history of these alpine herbs was markedly affected by the Miocene-Pliocene QTP uplifts and Quaternary climatic oscillations. We found that the four Notopterygium species had generally low levels of nucleotide variability within populations. Molecular dating and isolation-with-migration analyses suggested that Notopterygium species diverged similar to 1.74-7.82 million years ago and their differentiation was significantly associated with recent uplifts of the eastern margin of the QTP. In addition, ecological niche modeling and population history analysis showed that N. incisum and N. franchetii underwent considerable demographic expansions during the last glacial period of the Pleistocene, whereas a demographic contraction and a expansion occurred for N. forrestii and N. oviforme during the antepenultimate interglacial period and penultimate glacial period, respectively. These findings highlight the importance of geological and climatic changes during the Miocene-Pliocene and Pleistocene as causes of species divergence and changes in population structure within cold-tolerant herbs in the QTP biodiversity hotspot."
1,"Forest fires are an integral part of the natural Earth system dynamics, however they are becoming more devastating and less predictable as anthropogenic climate change exacerbates their impacts. In order to advance fire science, fire danger reanalysis products can be used as proxy for fire weather observations with the advantage of being homogeneously distributed both in space and time. This manuscript describes a reanalysis dataset of fire danger indices based on the Canadian Fire Weather Index system and the ECMWF ERA5 reanalysis dataset, which supersedes the previous dataset based on ERA-Interim. The new fire danger reanalysis dataset provides a number of benefits compared to the one based on ERA-Interim: it relies on better estimates of precipitation, evaporation and soil moisture, it is available in a deterministic form as well as a probabilistic ensemble and it is characterised by a considerably higher spatial resolution. It is a valuable resource for forestry agencies and scientists in the field of wildfire danger modeling and beyond. The global dataset is produced by ECMWF, as the computational centre of the European Forest Fire information System (EFFIS) of the Copernicus Emergency Management Service, and it is made available free of charge through the Climate Data Store."
1,"Fires are widespread disturbance events with many implications for different aspects of plant persistence and vegetation properties. Changing fire regimes can profoundly affect vegetation dynamics and ecosystem properties. Recent steep increases in the frequency of fires worldwide and the occurrence of megafires have caught the attention of scientists, policymakers, and the media. The FLORA Special Issue on Fire and Vegetation unites five invited Opinion Papers with emphasis on South America and nineteen research papers, including one review, on different aspects of the fire-vegetation interaction. The studies contribute both to the discussion of how to better manage fire in ecosystems and to improve our understanding of fire effects on organisms, communities, and ecosystems. Our expectation is that the Special Issue stimulates further research and, ultimately, helps to inform fire management practice to improve human well-being, to ensure the sustainability of resource use, and perhaps most important, biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation."
0,"Commons and social-ecological systems research examines institutional arrangements for governing natural resources to improve social and ecological outcomes. However, no universal definition of success exists. We examine the CPR and SES synthesis literature to identify trends, gaps and challenges for examining success. We address: (1) gaps in the literature, (2) multidimensionality and tradeoffs, and (3) and the link between problem orientation and definitions of success. To do this we conduct a comprehensive review of Large-N studies, meta-analyses and systematic reviews of CPR and SES governance (n = 45). We found seven dimensions of success, corresponding to collective choice, constitutional and operational levels, temporal dimensions, and socio-economic outcomes. Most studies did not address power and tradeoffs, or specify the social groups to whom success would apply. The majority of studies defined success in one dimension, most often demand-side provisioning (e.g., productivity or biodiversity). A regression analysis suggests that studies on rangelands or grasslands, correlative studies, and/or studies of state property systems (i.e., protected areas) were more likely to use fewer dimensions of success. Problem orientations often did not correlate with dimensions of success considered in a study, suggesting that measures of success often cannot adequately address the full suite of problems recognized in synthesis research. This presents a significant challenge for collective action among scholars who aim to develop general knowledge on SES and CPR governance. We discuss exemplary studies that measure success as multidimensional, address power and tradeoffs, and conclude with four recommendations for advancing the analysis of success."
0,"Biodiversity collections are experiencing a renaissance fueled by the intersection of informatics, emerging technologies, and the extended use and interpretation of specimens and archived databases. In this article, we explore the potential for transformative research in ecology integrating biodiversity collections, stable isotope analysis (SIA), and environmental informatics. Like genomic DNA, SIA provides a common currency interpreted in the context of biogeochemical principles. Integration of SIA data across collections allows for evaluation of long-term ecological change at local to continental scales. Challenges including the analysis of sparse samples, a lack of information about baseline isotopic composition, and the effects of preservation remain, but none of these challenges is insurmountable. The proposed research framework interfaces with existing databases and observatories to provide benchmarks for retrospective studies and ecological forecasting. Collections and SIA add historical context to fundamental questions in freshwater ecological research, reference points for ecosystem monitoring, and a means of quantitative assessment for ecosystem restoration."
1,"This research is a contribution to the discussion of natural hazards in urban areas in the context of Climate Change. The study analyzes the dangerousness and exposure by tropical cyclones in the metropolitan area of Tampico, which historically has suffered catastrophic flooding. The methodology uses a Geographic Information System for de cartographic integration of the climate, hydrometeorological y geomorphological data, and to determine the space-time frequency and distribution of the extraordinary events associated to the city floods danger. As a result, a valuable mapping of natural hazards associated with the impact of tropical cyclones and extreme rainfall was achieved, which is necessary for future risk management and urban planning of cities in the Gulf of Mexico. The forecast warned of an increased risk of flooding in the study area, associated with more extreme hydrometeorological phenomena, possibly linked to global climate change and, above all, the growth of urban areas at risk. In the 21st century, the impact high-intensity tropical cyclones (categories IV and V) in the region are expected. The consequences can be catastrophic for the metropolitan area and its population in a context of lack of planning and prevention."
1,"Marine heatwaves (MHWs) and Cold Spells (marine cold spells (MCSs)) are events of extreme positive and negative temperature anomalies, that last 5 days or longer. These events have been diagnosed across oceans from sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and recognized to affect ecosystems' health worldwide. Some studies have focused on the extent, evolution, and drivers of specifically intense and long-lasting regional MHW events. Although extreme temperature anomalies could lead to coral bleaching, mortality, and ecosystems' shift from healthy to barren reefs, no studies have focused on MHWs and MCSs in the Caribbean Sea. This study characterizes them in the Caribbean Sea, explores simultaneous thermal-stress and coral response, and reveals prevailing environmental conditions during their occurrence. We use four decades of SSTs observed daily and a recently published database of worldwide coral bleaching events. We found bleaching events occurring simultaneously with both MCSs and MHWs, often with extreme events of mild intensity and typical duration. We find a positive long-term trend in MHWs' frequency, consistent not only with global warming, but also with the Atlantic Meridional Mode. There is a clear seasonal signal with MHWs occurring more often in summer and MCSs in autumn-winter. Our results suggest MHWs and MCSs development is related to El Nino/La Nina conditions, respectively. Finally, we identify intense extreme temperature events that span large areas as candidates for future studies on their dynamics. Our results are relevant for the development of MHWs and MCSs forecasts applied to conservation strategies and ecosystem-based management of marine resources, particularly in reef systems. Events of extremely warm and cold temperatures that last 5 days or longer in the ocean are denominated Marine Heatwaves (MHWs) and marine cold spells (MCSs), respectively. Analysis of sea surface temperature observed with satellites over the past decades have shown MHWs are occurring more often and have important ecological implications. This study focuses on MHWs and MCSs in the Caribbean Sea over the last four decades to: (a) determine their typical duration, intensity, and frequency; (b) explore if their occurrence coincides with recorded coral bleaching events; (c) determine their temporal variability, as well as correlation with climate indices; and (d) identify the largest and most intense MHW and MCS events. We present evidence of Caribbean MCSs and MHWs linked to widespread coral bleaching. Additionally, we reveal MHWs/MCSs occur more often during summer/winter and El Nino/La Nina conditions and show an increase in MHWs' frequency consistent with long-term warming, and natural climate modes of variability such as the Atlantic Meridional Mode. Our findings contribute to the improvement of tools that anticipate MHWs and MCSs for the management of reefs, which are ecosystems that host large biodiversity, support societal needs, and that are under pressure due to ongoing climate change. Caribbean marine heatwave (MHW) and marine cold spell (MCS) are simultaneous with coral bleaching eventsMHWs/MCSs have a seasonal signal, being more frequent and intense during summer/autumn-winter and in the SE region of the CaribbeanMHWs/MCSs are longer, stronger, and more frequent during the +/- phase of Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, Atlantic Meridional Mode and Caribbean, and occur more often during +/- El Nino Southern Oscillation conditions"
1,"In urban areas, the impacts of flash floods can be very severe as these regions are generally densely populated and contain vital infrastructure. Parts of the UK have been particularly prone to serious urban flooding in recent years, such as Boscastle in 2004. Due to climate change, the occurrence of urban flooding is predicted to increase in the future, which is likely to lead to increasing flood risk to people and property in urban areas. It is therefore appropriate to estimate potential flood risk to people and property for improved flood risk management. This paper outlines an integrated numerical model for estimating flood risk in urban areas. The model includes a module for predicting the two-dimensional hydrodynamic characteristics of urban floods and a new module for predicting the flood risk to people (both children and adults) and property (including vehicles and buildings). The hydrodynamic module of this model was verified against laboratory experimental data and real flood tracks in urban areas. The integrated model was also applied to predict the flood risk to people and property for the Boscastle 2004 floods, with different recurrence frequencies. The developed integrated model can be used to predict the potential flood risk to people and property in urban areas and such predictions can be used as a rough assessment in improving flood risk management."
1,"A significant change in the precipitation pattern over India has been reported in previous studies. This change includes an increase in heavy precipitation and a decrease in light and/or moderate precipitation. This study examines the possible link between these changes and regional climate conditions, using regional surface temperature and Vertically Integrated Moisture Transport (VIMT) records. It is reported that precipitation extremes during the southwest (SW) monsoon season show coherent variability with surface temperature over India. The precipitation spectrum shows significant changes from cold to warm years, with increases in heavy precipitation and decreases in light and/or moderate precipitation. The study reveals a decreasing trend in VIMT over the Bay of Bengal, which is consistent with decreases in the number of monsoon depressions over the region. It is observed that an increase in VIMT over the Arabian Sea shows coherent variation with precipitation extremes over India. The results reported in this article are crucial when considering the increase in drought and flood events in a changing climate."
1,"Fragmentation is a major driver of ecosystem degradation, reducing the capacity of habitats to provide many important ecosystem services. Mangrove ecosystem services, such as erosion prevention, shoreline protection and mitigation of climate change (through carbon sequestration), depend on the size and arrangement of forest patches, but we know little about broad-scale patterns of mangrove forest fragmentation. Here we conduct a multi-scale analysis using global estimates of mangrove density and regional drivers of mangrove deforestation to map relationships between habitat loss and fragmentation. Mangrove fragmentation was ubiquitous; however, there are geographic disparities between mangrove loss and fragmentation; some regions, like Cambodia and the southern Caribbean, had relatively little loss, but their forests have been extensively fragmented. In Southeast Asia, a global hotspot of mangrove loss, the conversion of forests to aquaculture and rice plantations were the biggest drivers of loss (>50%) and fragmentation. Surprisingly, conversion of forests to oil palm plantations, responsible for >15% of all deforestation in Southeast Asia, was only weakly correlated with mangrove fragmentation. Thus, the management of different deforestation drivers may increase or decrease fragmentation. Our findings suggest that large scale monitoring of mangrove forests should also consider fragmentation. This work highlights that regional priorities for conservation based on forest loss rates can overlook fragmentation and associated loss of ecosystem functionality."

1,"Currently, lake surface water temperature (LSWT), as one of the most important indicators for evaluating lake health, is rapidly rising due to the influence of large-scale climate change and regional human activities in rapidly developing urban areas. The variety of LSWT will affect water environment problems such as lake water quality, aquatic organism growth and reproduction. Therefore, this study selected six lakes that play a crucial role in China's economic and social development, and explored the causes and driving mechanisms of LSWT changes, which would provide support for the governance and protection of the ecological environment. Meanwhile, according to the fluctuation of lake boundary, the lakes were divided into two types, A and B. Based on the classification, the changing characteristics of LSWT from 2001 to 2018 were analyzed, and the stepwise polynomial regression analysis was used as new method to quantify the contribution from each driving factor to LSWT. Then, the driving mechanisms of natural and anthropogenic factors to LSWT was discussed. Results show that (1) the mean comprehensive change rates of LSWT-day and LSWT-night showed an upward trend in the past 18 years. The correlation between near surface air temperature (NSAT) and the annual average LSWT of the 6 lakes was higher than that of other factors, and this feature was most significant in spring, autumn and winter. The correlation between anthropogenic factors and annual average LSWT was affected by lake type, NSAT and precipitation in the basin. (2) Natural factors (especially NSAT) had higher contribution rates to LSWT. The contribution from anthropogenic factors to LSWT-night was higher than that in the daytime. For lakes classified in type B, the effect intensity of anthropogenic factors on LSWT-day was affected by NSAT, precipitation and lake area. The contribution rate to LSWT-night was related to the growth rate of the impervious surface area in the basin."
1,"The European hare ( Lepus europaeus), ), commonly known as the gray hare, belongs to the Leporidae family. Widely distributed throughout Poland, it exhibits higher population density in the eastern regions. However, Europe has witnessed a significant decline in hare populations over the past 50 years, a trend also observed in most Polish areas. Contributing factors include intensified agriculture, habitat loss, urbanization, pollution (water, air, and soil), and climate change, all impacting population dynamics, including reproduction. Increased predation by foxes, raccoons, and birds of prey, along with poaching and hunting-related damage, further affect hare populations. Infectious and parasitic diseases play a crucial role in hare health, often leading to mortality. These animals constantly interact with various pathogens and vectors due to their natural environment. The objective of this study was to assess the health of the European hare population in the Lublin Upland based on macroscopic findings during autopsies. The research involved 85 hares from two hunting districts in the western part of the Lublin Upland. These animals were necropsied, and material was collected for laboratory tests. Macroscopic examinations revealed the presence of several diseases, including brucellosis (6 cases), rodentiosis (11 cases), tularemia (3 cases), echinococcosis (5 cases), and cysticercosis (11 cases). Most of these diseases are classified as dangerous zoonotic infections. The detection of multiple diseases underscores the gray hare's role as a reservoir in the natural environment. These confirmed diseases pose significant risks, often proving fatal for both hares and their predators. As a game species, European hares also pose a threat to hunters who handle infected animals. Moreover, meat from sick hares jeopardizes consumer health and safety. This research holds substantial importance for veterinary medicine and public health, aiding in early diagnosis and effective disease prevention strategies."
0,"There is a growing need to integrate ecosystem services into management strategies of protected areas, and only a comprehensive ecosystem services assessment allows effective strategies for biodiversity conservation to be defined. Beneficiaries are largely disregarded or only mentioned in ecosystem services assessments related to protected areas. Thus, we propose indicators for identifying potential beneficiaries on the local and regional level, focusing on 16 relevant ecosystem services of Natura 2000 sites. For a case study in northern Italy, we used spatially-explicit modelling approaches to map and quantify the potential beneficiaries of multiple ecosystem services, including distance decay functions and basin catchment modelling. The resulting maps indicate that for provisioning and cultural services, the majority of the beneficiaries are located outside the protected area, whereas the beneficiaries of regulating services are mostly situated within or very close to it The indicators and the beneficiary maps offer an important basis for an exhaustive assessment of ecosystem services flows from Natura 2000 sites and support the implementation of conservation policies by involving the local population and the community of users of protected areas.

1,"Bangladesh is a country that comprises much of the world's largest delta, formed from the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Meghna (GBM) rivers and their tributaries. Flooding is a fact of life in Bangladesh where up to two-thirds of the country is flooded annually from combined monsoonal rains and Himalayan snowmelt. For this reason, understanding flood dynamics on both local and regional scales is critical. However, flood hazard studies to date typically rely on single flooding events to create flood maps and to evaluate flood hazards using satellite imagery. Here we use geographic information systems to analyze weekly water level data from 304 river gauges and over 1200 groundwater gauges from the Bangladesh Water Development Board to determine the spatial and temporal changes in flood depth and extent. These data cover an eight year period from 2002 to 2010 and provide a temporal resolution that match or are better than that of available satellite imagery. Country-wide ground and surface water levels and corresponding annual flooding events were determined along with groundwater level, flooding, and precipitation trends in Bangladesh at multiple scales. We find that while precipitation within the GBM basin has steadily increased through the time series, the average country-wide inundation depth and absolute water level has been decreasing. These respective trends could be attributed to improved flood management strategies in Bangladesh and surrounding countries that are within the GBM basin, as well as fluctuating weather patterns, declining volume of Himalayan snowmelt runoff, dam construction upriver from the GBD both within and outside the Bangladesh border, and increased groundwater abstraction of shallow groundwater aquifers for sustaining life in the eighth most populous country in the world."
1,"Microorganisms serve as linchpins in agricultural systems. Classic examples include microbial composting for nutrient recovery, using microorganisms in biogas technology for agricultural waste utilization, and employing biofilters to reduce emissions from stables or improve water quality in aquaculture. This mini-review highlights the importance of microbiome analysis in understanding microbial diversity, dynamics, and functions, fostering innovations for a more sustainable agriculture. In this regard, customized microorganisms for soil improvement, replacements for harmful agrochemicals or antibiotics in animal husbandry, and (probiotic) additives in animal nutrition are already in or even beyond the testing phase for a large-scale conventional agriculture. Additionally, as climate change reduces arable land, new strategies based on closed-loop systems and controlled environment agriculture, emphasizing microbial techniques, are being developed for regional food production. These strategies aim to secure the future food supply and pave the way for a sustainable, resilient, and circular agricultural economy."
1,"Species attributes are commonly used to infer impacts of environmental change on multiyear species trends, e.g. decadal changes in population size. However, by themselves attributes are of limited value in global change attribution since they do not measure the changing environment. A broader foundation for attributing species responses to global change may be achieved by complementing an attributes-based approach by one estimating the relationship between repeated measures of organismal and environmental changes over short time scales. To assess the benefit of this multiscale perspective, we investigate the recent impact of multiple environmental changes on European farmland birds, here focusing on climate change and land use change. We analyze more than 800 time series from 18 countries spanning the past two decades. Analysis of long-term population growth rates documents simultaneous responses that can be attributed to both climate change and land-use change, including long-term increases in populations of hot-dwelling species and declines in long-distance migrants and farmland specialists. In contrast, analysis of annual growth rates yield novel insights into the potential mechanisms driving long-term climate induced change. In particular, we find that birds are affected by winter, spring, and summer conditions depending on the distinct breeding phenology that corresponds to their migratory strategy. Birds in general benefit from higher temperatures or higher primary productivity early on or in the peak of the breeding season with the largest effect sizes observed in cooler parts of species' climatic ranges. Our results document the potential of combining time scales and integrating both species attributes and environmental variables for global change attribution. We suggest such an approach will be of general use when high-resolution time series are available in large-scale biodiversity surveys."
0,"Aim: The main aim of this review article is to present a systematic review on Mapping the Impact of Environmental Pollutants on Human Health and Environment: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.Methodology: The literature review was carried out using scientific databases like Scopus, Web of Science, Science Direct, ResearchGate, Google Scholar and PubMed up to May 2023 by adopting PRSIMA methodology. The keywords used were Environmental Pollutants, Human Health Risks, Environmental Contaminants, Carcinogenic Pollutants, Heavy Metals, and Health Effects.Results: The results compiled from various sources showed that prolonged exposure to pollutants is associated with human health effects. Due to these toxic pollutants present in more than their permissible limit in the environment. These are causing a serious damage in the natural environment as well as human health. The major human health risk associated are digestive disorders, organ damage, gastrointestinal issues, organ damage, cancer, lowering the immune system, hepatotoxicity, neurotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, endocrine disruptions and ultimately leading to the death. These toxic pollutants are also disturbing the climate, eutrophication, ozone layer depletion, acid rain, global warming and disrupting the geochemical cycles in the environment.Conclusion: As a result of the in-depth meta-analysis of the previous published literature on environmental pollutants. It has become evident that the presence of these pollutants poses a grave threat to the well-being of humans and the delicate balance of ecosystems. According to the findings of this review, exposure to environmental pollutants can result in a number of health problems in humans and disturbing the natural environment."
1,"Changes in the hydrological cycle, as predicted and currently observed, are expected to significantly impact the water and carbon balance of water-limited forest ecosystems. However, differences in the water-sensitivity of component processes make carbon balance predictions challenging. To examine responses of ecosystem components to water limitations, we conducted a study of tree, soil and ecosystem-level processes in a young ponderosa pine stand under natural summer drought (control) and increased soil water conditions (watered). Weekly-averaged tree transpiration (T-tree), gross ecosystem photosynthesis (GPP) and soil CO2 efflux (RStree; nearby trees) were related with soil water content (SWC; polynomial form: T-tree R-2 = 0.98 and RStree R-2 = 0.91, logarithmic form: GPP R-2 = 0.86) and declined rapidly when relative extractable soil water (REW) was <50%. The sensitivity of daily variations in canopy conductance (G(s)) to vapor pressure deficit was affected by SWC (R-2 = 0.97; logarithmic function), decreasing at REW <50%. Watering maintained REW at about 70% in July and August but positively affected tree carbon and water dynamics only at the end of summer when fluxes in the control treatment were strongly water-limited. A tight coupling of above- and belowground fluxes became apparent. In the control treatment, root-rhizosphere respiration (Rr) decreased along with GPP and T-tree (R-2 = 0.58) as drought progressed, while watering maintained Rr, T-tree and G(s) at a significantly higher level than those of the unwatered trees in late summer. In contrast, microbial respiration responded instantaneously and strongly to the watering compared to the control treatment. The net effect was that increased soil water availability during the typical dry growing season has a negative effect on the short-term seasonal ecosystem C balance due to a larger increase in decomposition than photosynthesis. However, longer-term effects remain uncertain. In summary, our study highlights that understanding the dissimilar response of tree dynamics and soil decomposition to water availability is a key component in predicting future C sequestration in water-limited forest ecosystems.

1,"Effective nitrogen management practices by using two cultivation techniques can improve corn productivity and soil carbon components such as soil carbon storage, microbial biomass carbon (MBC), carbon management index (CMI), and water-soluble carbon (WSC). It is essential to ensure the long-term protection of dry-land agricultural systems. However, excessive application of nitrogen fertilizer reduces the efficiency of nitrogen use and also leads to increased greenhouse gas emissions from farming soil and several other ecological problems. Therefore, we conducted field trials under two planting methods during 2019-2020: P: plastic mulching ridges; F: traditional flat planting with nitrogen management practices, i.e., 0: no nitrogen fertilizer; FN: a common nitrogen fertilizer rate for farmers of 290 kg ha(-1); ON: optimal nitrogen application rate of 230 kg ha(-1); (ON75%+DCD): 25% reduction in optimal nitrogen fertilizer rate + dicyandiamide; (ON75%+NC): 25% reduction in optimal nitrogen rate + nano-carbon. The results showed that compared to other treatments, the PON75%+DCD treatment significantly increased soil water storage, water use efficiency (WUE), and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) because total evapotranspiration (ET) and GHG were reduced. Under the PON75%+DCD or PON75%+NC, the soil carbon storage significantly (50% or 47%) increased. The PON75%+DCD treatment is more effective in improving MBC, CMI, and WSC, although it increases gaseous carbon emissions more than all other treatments. Compared with FFN, under the PON75%+DCD treatment, the overall CH4, N2O, and CO2 emissions are all reduced. Under the PON75%+DCD treatment, the area scale GWP (52.7%), yield scale GWP (90.3%), biomass yield (22.7%), WUE (42.6%), NUE (80.0%), and grain yield (32.1%) significantly increased compared with F-FN, which might offset the negative ecological impacts connected with climate change. The PON75%+DCD treatment can have obvious benefits in terms of increasing yield and reducing emissions. It can be recommended to ensure future food security and optimal planting and nitrogen management practices in response to climate change."
1,"Nutrient losses due to leaching from agricultural soils can be substantial but, in some cases, soil microbes such as arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi can buffer those losses. An important knowledge gap, however, is the extent to which climate change may affect AM fungal mediation of leaching via warming and drought. To investigate this, we grew lucerne (Medicago sativa) and tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea), in the presence and absence of AM fungal inoculation (Rhizophagus irregularis), under different temperature [ambient: 26 degrees C (aT); elevated: 30 degrees C (eT)] and water [well-watered: 100% soil water holding capacity (WHC); droughted: 40% WHC] treatments. After four months of plant growth, leached nutrients (PO4-, NH4+ and NO3-), plant biomass, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and mycorrhizal parameters (colonization and extraradical hyphae biomass) were measured. The presence of AM fungi significantly reduced P leaching with lucerne by 46% for both temperature treatments, but P loss with tall fescue was only reduced under aT (by 48%). The negation of this benefit for tall fescue under eT was associated with a reduction in mycorrhizal root colonization, while temperature did not alter mycorrhizal root colonization of lucerne. Watering regime was not observed to influence P loss via leaching. We did not find a mycorrhizal effect on N leaching for either species; however, we found that N leaching increased under drought with lucerne and responded interactively to warming and drought with tall fescue. Overall, AM fungi significantly reduced P leaching for both species, but warming eliminated this effect for tall fescue, suggesting that warming may differentially affect P leaching depending upon plant species."
1,"Multiple factors contribute to wildfires in California and other regions: drought, winds, climate change, and spreading urbanization. Little has been done to study the multiple roles of nurses related to wildfire disasters. Major nursing organizations support disaster education for nurses. It is essential for nurses to recognize their roles in each phase of the disaster cycle: mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery. Skills learned in the US federal all-hazards approach to disasters can then be adapted to more specific disasters, such as wildfires, and issues affecting health care. Nursing has an important role in each phase of the disaster cycle."
0,"Maternal stress is a common source of heritable health and behavioral variation. This type of maternal effect could be particularly important for honey bees (Apis mellifera), as a single queen is responsible for many generations of workers who perform all colony functions including raising subsequent worker generations. Multiple factors work synergistically to cause colony loss, but a role for maternal stress effects is unstudied. We used an artificial cold temperature treatment as a proof-of-concept approach to investigate whether acute queen stress causes changes in worker phenotypes, including egg hatching rate, development time, and adult behavior and immune function. We found that queen stress impacts early-life phenotypes (egg hatching and development time), with more limited impacts on adult phenotypes (behavior and immune function). Thus, if maternal stress impacts colony health, it is likely through cumulative impacts on worker population numbers, not through phenotypic effects that impact individual adult worker behavior or health resilience. This study addresses an important and overlooked question, and provides a baseline understanding of the likely impacts of queen stress on worker phenotypes."
1,"While much research has addressed the aboveground response of trees to climate warming and related water shortage, not much is known about the drought sensitivity of the fine root system, in particular of mature trees. This study investigates the response of topsoil (0-10 cm) fine root biomass (FRB), necromass (FRN), and fine root morphology of five temperate broadleaf tree species (Acer platanoides L., Carpinus betulus L., Fraxinus excelsior L., Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl., Tilia cordata Mill.) to a reduction in water availability, combining a precipitation gradient study (nine study sites; mean annual precipitation (MAP): 920-530 mm year(-1)) with the comparison of a moist period (average spring conditions) and an exceptionally dry period in the summer of the subsequent year. The extent of the root necromass/biomass (N/B) ratio increase was used as a measure of the species' belowground sensitivity to water deficits. We hypothesized that the N/B ratio increases with long-term (precipitation gradient) and short-term reductions (moist vs. dry period) of water availability, while FRB changes only a little. In four of the five species (exception: A. platanoides), FRB did not change with a reduction in MAP, whereas FRN and N/B ratio increased toward the dry sites under ample water supply (exception: Q. petraea). Q. petraea was also the only species not to reduce root tip frequency after summer drought. Different slopes of the N/B ratio-MAP relation similarly point at a lower belowground drought sensitivity of Q. petraea than of the other species. After summer drought, all species lost the MAP dependence of the N/B ratio. Thus, fine root mortality increased more at the moister than the drier sites, suggesting a generally lower belowground drought sensitivity of the drier stands. We conclude that the five species differ in their belowground drought response. Q. petraea follows the most conservative soil exploration strategy with a generally smaller FRB and more drought-tolerant fine roots, as it maintains relatively constant FRB, FRN, and morphology across spatial and temporal dimensions of soil water deficits."
1,"Good quality water and arable land are required for both domestic and agricultural uses. Increasing population leads to urbanization and industrialization increasing the need to share these resources and creating threats to the food supply. Higher meat consumption requires mitigation strategies to protect food and mitigate economic crises, especially in developing nations. The production of food crops for energy purposes and lower yield due to climate change increase food prices as well as have a negative impact on the economy. Thus, an alternative food source is required featuring high forage components to reduce grazing periods and to prevent rangeland degradation. Halophytes can tolerate high salinity and can be easily grown for fodder in coastal areas where fodder is a problem. Varied climate conditions offer opportunities to grow suitable halophytes for specific purposes. One important feature is their use as fodder. To reduce food shortages, saline areas could be used to grow nutritive and productive halophytic forage. Wild plants have undesirable metabolites produced in harsh conditions which may be harmful for ruminant health. Halophytes have moderate amounts of these metabolites which are nontoxic. Halophytes can be grown without intruding on agricultural lands and freshwater resources and could promote livestock production which may improve the socio-economic conditions of poor farmers in a sustainable and ecofriendly manner."
1,"Future water abstraction challenges, such as increasing pressures and climate change effects on water resources, mean that water resource managers will need greater flexibility in determining the way water is allocated, especially in the context of licensing policy. Over-abstraction and particularly unsustainable abstraction from rivers can be very destructive to aquatic biodiversity. Therefore, restoring important characteristics of the natural flow regime (i.e. quantity, frequency, timing and duration of flow events, rates of change and predictability/variability) is fundamental to improving aquatic habitats, and increasing biodiversity. Within England, a set of standards for river flows have been developed to assess the risk of deterioration in ecological status that is posed by changes to river flows. Although applying these ecological flow targets can make the process very simple, the use of such standards can be a challenging area, as this does not recognize the uncertainties in applying these standards at a local level, especially in cases where there is a greater pressure on the environment. To further improve environmental protection and water resource management, targeted research is being undertaken to meet future abstraction challenges and flow regulation pressures, which result in failure to achieve environmental objectives. This includes the grouping of water bodies with similar hydrological regimes and ecological responses to flow change to determine the feasibility of more localised water management targets."
1,"Background: There is rapidly growing evidence indicating that extreme temperature is a crucial trigger and potential activator of asthma; however, the effects of extreme temperature on asthma are inconsistently reported and the its potential mechanisms remain undefined.Objectives: This review aims to estimate the impacts of extreme heat, extreme cold, and temperature variations on asthma by systematically summarizing the existing studies from epidemiological evidence to biological plausibility.Methods: We conducted a systematic search in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science from inception to June 30, 2022, and we retrieved articles of epidemiology and biological studies which assessed associations between extreme temperatures and asthma. This protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021273613).Results: From 12,435 identified records, 111 eligible studies were included in the qualitative synthesis, and 37 articles were included in the meta-analysis (20 for extreme heat, 16 for extreme cold, and 15 for temperature variations). For epidemiological evidence, we found that the synergistic effects of extreme temperatures, indoor/ outdoor environments, and individual vulnerabilities are important triggers for asthma attacks, especially when there is extreme heat or cold. Meta-analysis further confirmed the associations, and the pooled relative risks for asthma attacks in extreme heat and extreme cold were 1.07 (95%CI: 1.03-1.12) and 1.20 (95%CI: 1.12-1.29), respectively. Additionally, this review discussed the potential inflammatory mechanisms behind the associations between extreme temperatures and asthma exacerbation, and highlighted the regulatory role of immunological pathways and transient receptor potential ion channels in asthma triggered by extreme temperatures. Conclusions: We concluded that both extreme heat and cold could significantly increase the risk of asthma. Additionally, we proposed a potential mechanistic framework, which is important for understanding the disease pathogenesis that uncovers the complex mechanisms of asthma triggered by extreme temperatures and protects the sensitive individuals from impacts of extreme weather events and climate change."
1,"A review of population and community dynamics and habitat selection of rodents in complex desert landscapes is presented. Population dynamics of rodents in all deserts are driven mainly by resource pulses induced by rainfall events. In a long-term perspective, this pattern is sometimes interrupted by rare extreme weather events and by habitat transformation due to wildfire or climate change. Rainfall-population density relations were found to be modified by intrinsic (population autoregulation, habitat selection) and extrinsic (interspecific competition, predation) processes, but the relative importance and geographic specificity of these processes are unclear. Density-dependent habitat selection was found in all studied desert rodent species inhabiting more than one habitat. Density-dependent habitat selection was expressed in different types of population regulation, resulting in density-dependent or density-independent habitat distribution. However, processes of density-dependent habitat selection have been studied in only one region; there are no data yet to analyze how different strategies of habitat selection vary among different desert regions. Dynamics of community composition include one widely distributed pattern, an increase in species richness with density. Another pattern, zero-sum community dynamic, was found in North American deserts. Dynamics of the niche community structure is expressed in the increase of niche overlap with density growth. In Palaearctic deserts, this increase in niche overlap was accompanied by stronger aggregation of niches in spatial guilds. The last phenomenon was not recorded in North American deserts, which reflects differences in expression of spatial guilds between Palaearctic and Nearctic rodent communities."
1,"Understanding climate-induced range shifts is crucial for biodiversity conservation. However, no general consensus has so far emerged about the mechanisms involved and the role of phylogeny in shaping species responses has been poorly explored. Here, we investigate whether species traits and their underlying phylogenetic constraints explain altitudinal shifts at the trailing and leading edges of stream fish species ranges. We demonstrate that these shifts are related to dissimilar mechanisms: whereas range retractions show some support for phylogenetic clustering due to a high level of conservatism in thermal safety margins, range expansions are underpinned by both evolutionarily conserved and labile traits, notably trophic position and life-history strategy, hence decreasing the strength of phylogenetic signal. Therefore, while climate change brings many difficulties in establishing a general understanding of species vulnerability, these findings emphasize how combining trait-based approaches in light of the species evolutionary history may offer new opportunities in facing conservation challenges."
1,"Fresh water resources, human societies, and ecosystems are expected to be strongly impacted by climate change, with precipitation trends being one of the most important elements that will be closely monitored. However, the natural variability of precipitation data can often mask existing trends such that the results appear as statistically insignificant. Information on the limitations of trend detection is important for risk assessment and for decision making related to adaption strategies under inherent uncertainties. This paper reports on an effort to quantify and map minimal detectable absolute trends in annual precipitation data series on a global scale. Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to generate realizations of trended precipitation data for different precipitation means and coefficients of variance, and the Mann-Kendall method was applied for detecting the trend significance. Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) VASClimO data was used to compute the mean and coefficient of variance of annual precipitation over land and to map minimal detectable absolute trends. It was found that relatively high magnitude trends (positive or negative) have a low chance of being detected as a result of high natural variance of the precipitation data. The largest undetectable trends were found for the tropics. Arid and semiarid regions also present high relative values in terms of percent change from the mean annual precipitation. Although the present analysis is based on several simplified assumptions, the goal was to point out an inherent problem of potentially undetectable high absolute trends that must be considered in analyzing precipitation data series and assessing risks in adaption strategies to climate change."
1,"Few conservation studies have examined fish communities in entire drainage basins, especially in developing regions such as Southeast Asia, one of the most diverse biomes globally. The aim of this study was to establish conservation projections for the whole of the Irrawaddy River system, based on fish diversity patterns, human impact, and environmental change. The Irrawaddy River is one of the five largest rivers in Southeast Asia. Although it has very high diversity of fish species and species endemism, our understanding of resident fish status remains poor. Based on 1,726 field survey and 1,056 database records, 470 fish species and their distribution patterns (i.e. alpha, beta, threatened species, and endemic species diversities) in sub-basins of the Irrawaddy drainage were identified. Canonical correspondence analysis of diversity and environmental patterns indicated that climatic factors had the largest effect on diversity, compatible with the species-energy theory. Fish conservation priorities of sub-basins were evaluated based on diversity patterns and human impact. The delta and Manipur basin regions were highlighted as areas of focus for future fish diversity conservation, and the importance of connectivity in the Irrawaddy main stem was demonstrated. The results of this study will be valuable for future management of the Irrawaddy basin and as a reference for other river basins when implementing protection strategies for fish diversity. This study also advocates the need for systematic investigations across entire drainage basins and further detailed studies on the ecological conditions of poorly studied river systems."
1,"Agriculture is a primary contributor of greenhouse gas emissions and thus plays an important role in global climate change. Assessments of the carbon footprints of agricultural products are therefore helpful in climate change mitigation. The objective of this study was to provide a quantitative estimate of the carbon footprint of spring maize (Zea mays L) production under different cultivation patterns. Four cultivation patterns were assessed in this study: traditional pattern, optimal pattern, super-high-yield pattern, and high-yield and high-efficiency pattern. The results showed that the greenhouse gas emissions from the agricultural inputs were 3225.2, 3152.9, 4557.2, and 4259.7 kg CO2-eq ha(-1) for the traditional, optimal, super-high-yield, and high-yield and high-efficiency patterns, respectively, in the spring maize production process. Fertilizers, including chemical fertilizers and organic fertilizer, predominated among the contributors of total greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural inputs, accounting for 66.8, 65.9, 76.1, and 74.4% among the traditional, optimal, super-high-yield, and high-yield and high-efficiency patterns, respectively. The carbon footprint per yield among different cultivation patterns ranged from 0.48 kg CO2-eq kg(-1), in the traditional pattern to 0,64 kg CO2-eq kg(-1) in the high yield and high-efficiency pattern, with intermediate values for the super-high-yield and optimal patterns. The N2O from soil and fertilizer application was the greatest contributor to the carbon footprint in spring maize production. Overall, higher yield and lower carbon footprint were concurrently observed under the super-high-yield pattern in the current study. Moreover, a reduction in the rate of fertilizers may provide a potential solution for reducing the carbon footprint of spring maize. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
1,"Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the Agriculture, Forest, and Other Land Use sector account for 23% of net global anthropogenic emissions. However, effective conservation agriculture practices can sequester carbon (C) up to 1 m in soil depth and vegetation biomass. Integrated Crop-Livestock-Forestry (ICLF) systems attempt to ensure sustainable agricultural production by combining various agricultural, livestock, and forestry production systems. This bibliographic review aims to present and discuss ICLF systems and their advantages and disadvantages compared with conventional systems, achieving a better understanding of the sources and sinks of GHGs (CH4, N2O, and CO2). Integrated systems exist in tropical and temperate climates with different practices, arrangements, designs, and modalities. Intercropping species with different root structures provides more ecological interactions that enhance biodiversity, soil quality, and C sequestration while reducing GHG emissions. Yet, ICLF systems are complex and require technical assistance and support for being implemented, besides an extensive initial investment that increases the cost of operation. A relevant carbon sink in ICLF systems is carbon from tree biomass, where the wood can be used for various purposes. Timber for sawmills and general construction has a longer C immobilization time. Methane from enteric fermentation is the greatest contributor to GHG emissions in livestock and ICLF systems. Nitrous oxide is released primarily from synthetic fertilizers (when applied), manure deposited on pastures, and the decomposition of plant residues. Carbon dioxide is emitted to a lesser extent from the application of lime and urea. Many studies do not include all compartments in the C balance and often focus on only one GHG or compartment of C. Accordingly, more studies on the sources and sinks of C and their potential to offset GHG emissions in terms of CO2 equivalent are urged."
1,"Due to the increasing concerns on global warming, scarce land for agriculture, and contamination impacts on human health, biochar application is being considered as one of the possible measures for carbon sequestration, promoting higher crop yield and contamination remediation. Significant amount of researches focusing on these three aspects have been conducted during recent years. Biochar as a soil amendment is effective in promoting plant performance and sustainability, by enhancing nutrient bioavailability, contaminants immobilization, and microbial activities. The features of biochar in changing soil physical and biochemical properties are essential in affecting the sustainability of an ecosystem. Most studies showed positive results and considered biochar application as an effective and promising measure for above-mentioned interests. Bio-engineered man-made filled slope and landfill slope increasingly draw the attention of geologists and geotechnical engineers. With increasing number of filled slopes, sustainability, low maintenance, and stability are the major concerns. Biochar as a soil amendment changes the key factors and parameters in ecology (plant development, soil microbial community, nutrient/contaminant cycling, etc.) and slope engineering (soil weight, internal friction angle and cohesion, etc.). This paper reviews the studies on the production, physical and biochemical properties of biochar and suggests the potential areas requiring study in balancing ecology and man-made filled slope and landfill cover engineering. Biochar-amended soil should be considered as a new type of soil in terms of soil mechanics. Biochar performance depends on soil and biochar type which imposes challenges to generalize the research outcomes. Aging process and ecotoxicity studies of biochar are strongly required."
1,"The observed increase in summer temperatures and the related glacier downwasting has led to a noticeable decrease of frozen water resources in Central Asia, with possible future impacts on the economy of all downstream countries in the region. Glaciers in the Ak-Shyirak massif, located in the Inner Tien Shan, are not only affected by climate change, but also impacted by the open pit goldmining of the Kumtor Gold Company. In this study, glacier inventories referring to the years 2003 and 2013 were created for the Ak-Shyirak massif based on satellite imagery. The 193 glaciers had a total area of 351.2 +/- 5.6 km(2) in 2013. Compared to 2003, the total glacier area decreased by 5.9 +/- 3.4%. During 2003-2013, the shrinkage rate of Ak-Shyirak glaciers was twice than that in 1977-2003 and similar to shrinkage rates in Tien Shan frontier ranges. We assessed glacier volume in 2013 using volume-area (VA) scaling and GlabTop modelling approaches. Resulting values for the whole massif differ strongly, the VA scaling derived volume is 30.0-26.4 km(3) whereas the GlabTop derived volume accounts for 18.8-13.2 km(3). Ice losses obtained from both approaches were compared to geodetically-derived volume change. VA scaling underestimates ice losses between 1943 and 2003 whereas GlabTop reveals a good match for eight glaciers for the period 2003-2012. In comparison to radio-echo soundings from three glaciers, the GlabTop model reveals a systematic underestimation of glacier thickness with a mean deviation of 16%. GlabTop tends to significantly underestimate ice thickness in accumulation areas, but tends to overestimate ice thickness in the lowermost parts of glacier snouts. Direct technogenic impact is responsible for about 7% of area and 5% of mass loss for glaciers in the Ak-Shyirak massif during 2003-2013. Therefore the increase of summer temperature seems to be the main driver of accelerated glacier shrinkage in the area. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
1,"Food production is one of the main contributors to climate change and its impact is set to increase due to population growth. Smart agriculture aims at providing solutions to reduce food production and environmental impact while, at the same time, increasing crop production. This paper proposes a system based on STDES-BTAG01 by STMicroelectronics to monitor in-vivo stem electrical impedance, which is a parameter that has recently demonstrated its efficacy in assessing information about plants' water stress status. The developed system is completely battery-free and equipped with a wireless communication module to transmit the acquired data. It is powered by a small amorphous solar cell and transmits data to a base station exploiting the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol. The system monitors the needed time to discharge a capacitor through the plant stem. After this, this span of time is used to compute the stem electrical impedance. Tests showed reading errors lower than 15% when dealing with impedance modules up to 180 k Omega. System characteristics (energy self-sufficiency, compactness, and low-power consumption) make the system implementable in the fields."
1,"Considered are the contribution of managed forests in the Russian Federation to the climate change softening and the forecast of their carbon-depositing potential in the period till 2050 under different scenarios of the forest management. The sink of CO2 to managed forests is estimated using the flow balance method. The CBM-CFS3 model worked out in the Canadian Forestry Service is used for predicting the carbon budget. It is found out that managed forests absorb 473.8 Mt of CO2 per year. The carbon sink is caused by the reduction of the volume of the forest use and by the regeneration of cutover stands of previous years. Depending on the conditions of the forest use, by 2020 the CO2 sink to managed forests will amount to 466-632 Mt/year and will be able to compensate from 21 to 29% of industrial emissions of greenhouse gases. The carbon absorption by managed forests will decrease to 105-235 Mt/year by 2050. To maintain and increase the carbon-depositing potential of managed forests, the Russian Federation needs the development of the system of purposeful activities on strengthening the protection against forest fires and on the intensification of forest reproduction."
1,"Background: Global warming and increasing extreme weather have become a severe problem in recent years, posing a significant threat to human health worldwide. Research exploring the link between injury as one of the leading causes of death globally and ambient temperature was lacking. Based on the hourly injury emergency ambulance dispatch (IEAD) records from 2019-2021 in the main urban area of Chongqing, this study explored the role of temperature extremes on the pathogenesis of injury by different mechanisms and identified sensitive populations for different mechanisms of injury.Methods: In this study, we collected hourly injury emergency ambulance dispatch (IEAD) records from Chongqing Emergency Dispatch Center in the main urban area of Chongqing from 2019 to 2021, and used a distributed lagged nonlinear model (DLNM) with quasi-Poisson distribution to evaluate the association between ambient temperature and IEADs. And the stratified analysis was performed by gender, age and different injury mechanisms to identify susceptible groups. Finally, the attributable burden of ambient extreme temperatures was also investigated.Results: The risk for total IEADs increased significantly at high temperature (32 & DEG;C) compared with optimal temperature (9 & DEG;C) (CRR: 1.210; 95%CI[1.127,1.300]). The risks of traffic accident injury (CRR: 1.346; 95%CI[1.167,1.552]), beating injury (CRR: 1.508; 95%CI[1.165,1.952]), fall-height injury (CRR: 1.871; 95%CI[1.196-2.926]) and injury of sharp penetration (CRR: 2.112; 95%CI[1.388-3.213]) were significantly increased. At low temperature (7 & DEG;C), the risk of fall injury (CRR: 1.220; 95% CI [1.063,1.400]) increased significantly. Lag for 24 hours at extreme low temperature (5 & DEG;C), the risk of 18-45 years (RR: 1.016; 95%CI[1.009,1.024]) and over 60 years of age (RR: 1.019; 95%CI[1.011,1.025]) increased significantly. The effect of 0 h delay in extreme high temperature (36 & DEG;C) on males aged 18-45 years (RR: 1.115; 95%CI[1.071,1.162]) and 46-59 years (RR: 1.069; 95%CI[1.023,1.115]) had significant impact on injury risk.Conclusions: This study showed that ambient temperature was significantly related to the risk of injury, and different mechanisms of injury were affected differently by extreme temperature. The increasing risk of traffic accident injury, beating injury, fall-height injury and sharp penetrating injury was associated with extreme heat, while fall injury was associated with extreme cold. The risk of injury in high temperature environment was mainly concentrated in males and young adults. The results of this study can help to identify the sensitive population with different injury mechanisms in extreme temperature environment, and provide reference for public health emergency departments to respond to relevant strategies in extreme temperature environment to minimize the potential risk to the public."
1,"The state of Andhra Pradesh, India falls in water stress 4 area. The primary objective of this study is to examine the spatial distribution of different chemical elements with respect to its contamination level. About 70% of drinking water needs in rural areas and 40% drinking water needs in urban areas are met from groundwater resources. In the last decades, rapid population growth coupled with agricultural expansion due to subsidized power to agriculture has significantly increased demand on groundwater resources. Combined to this, the effect of Global warming has put stress on ground water which is resulting in declines in water levels and deterioration of ground water quality. This may be evidenced by the fact that the phreatic aquifer which was in use two decades ago, is existing no more now in some of the parts of the study area and the water is being drawn from deeper aquifers beyond phreatic aquifers. The study has been carried out for which one or more elements are contaminated and to study its spatial distribution."
1,"Disturbance of forested catchments by fire, logging, or other natural or human induced events that alter the evapotranspiration regime may be a substantial threat to domestic, environmental and industrial water supplies. While security of water supplies have always been of high importance in Australia, the recent long-lived drought, climate change predictions and two major mega fire events in 4 years that have burnt over 2 million ha of native forest in Victoria alone, have placed alarming uncertainty on the State's water resources. Furthermore, there are predictions of more frequent and intense wildfire under climate change (Howe et al., 2005). Physically-based models that can predict the hydrologic impact of forest disturbance and climatic inputs will be crucial for understanding changed water yields and for informing forest management options. One such model is Macaque (Watson, 1999), a physically based spatially distributed daily time step process model that was developed specifically to replicate the water yield variation over time observed in Victorian central highland catchments after the 1939 bushfires. This paper describes the modelling of the long term changes in water yield from two fire affected catchments, and of fire and climate change scenarios in Melbourne's principal water supply catchment (488km(2)). The effect of scale, data availability and quality, and of species parameterisation is explored. For the two fire affected catchments, Mitta Mitta (1533 km(2)) and Tambo (551 km(2)) 250 year simulations were run with the changed vegetation conditions and with no disturbance. Macaque predicted a significant yield decrease, with a maximum annual change of 17% for the Mitta Mitta and a long-term decrease of 7%. These values were 20% and 7% for the Tambo. However there were some important uncertainties identified. The model calibrations although reasonable (Nash & Sutcliffe (E) = 0.5-0.6) demonstrated there were periods with significant discrepancies between observed and predicted flows in the calibration phase. It is likely that poor precipitation coverage over large, sparsely populated catchments is one cause. A second may have been the use of the model outside of its development range; i.e. into areas with drier forest types where the evapotranspiration characteristics are not well known. Subsequently, Macaque was calibrated for the Thomson catchment (488 km(2)), which has a better coverage of rainfall stations, and a far smaller proportion of drier eucalypt species. The calibrations were much improved (E = 0.7-0.8), demonstrating Macaque to be an appropriate model for evaluating forest disturbance where input data is of high quality. Simulations of fire scenarios and of potential climate change scenarios were run. The latter were based on CSIRO projections of rainfall and temperature changes for the Melbourne region. There was no consideration of vegetation physiological responses to climate change. The simulations give an indication of the magnitude of yield responses that should be considered by catchment managers. Such predictions can be placed in the context of other disturbances or management decisions such as timber harvesting. The ability of Macaque to simulate spatially-distributed disturbance is important. The modelling has produced useful insights into potential yield responses to plausible disturbance scenarios. The research also demonstrates the decline in model performance when input parameters are problematic."
1,"We combined imagery from multiple sources (MODIS, Landsat-5, 7, 8) with land cover data to test for long-term (1984-2015) greening or browning trends of vegetation in a temperate alpine area, the Ecrins National Park, in the context of recent climate change and domestic grazing practices. We showed that over half (56%) of the Ecrins National Park displayed significant increases in peak normalized difference vegetation index (NDVImax) over the last 16 years (2000-2015). Importantly, the highest proportional increases in NDVImax occurred in rocky habitats at high elevations (> 2500 ma.s.l.). While spatial agreement in the direction of change in NDVImax as detected by MODIS and Landsat was high (76% overlap), correlations between log-response ratio values were of moderate strength (approx. 0.3). In the context of above treeline habitats, we found that proportional increases in NDVImax were higher between 1984 and 2000 than between 2000 and 2015, suggesting a slowing of greening dynamics during the recent decade. The timing of accelerated greening prior to 2000 coincided with a pronounced increase in the amount of snow-free growing degree-days that occurred during the 1980s and 1990s. In the case of grasslands and low-shrub habitats, we did not find evidence for a negative effect of grazing on greening trends, possibly due to the low grazing intensity typically found in the study area. We propose that the emergence of a longer and warmer growing season enabled high-elevation plant communities to produce more biomass, and also allowed for plant colonization of habitats previously characterized by long-lasting snow cover. Increasing plant productivity in an alpine context has potential implications for biodiversity trajectories and for ecosystem services in mountain landscapes. The presented evidence for long-term greening trends in a representative region of the European Alps provides the basis for further research on mechanisms of greening in alpine landscapes."
1,"Recent studies reported weakening in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and in the Gulf Stream (GS), using records of about a decade (RAPID project) or two (altimeter data). Coastal sea level records are much longer, so the possibility of detecting climatic changes in ocean circulation from sea level data is intriguing and thus been examined here. First, it is shown that variations in the AMOC transport from the RAPID project since 2004 are consistent with the flow between Bermuda and the U. S. coast derived from the Oleander measurements and from sea level difference (SLDIF). Despite apparent disagreement between recent studies on the ability of data to detect weakening in the GS flow, estimated transport changes from 3 different independent data sources agree quite well with each other on the extreme decline in transport in 2009-2010. Due to eddies and meandering, the flow representing the GS part of the Oleander line is not correlated with AMOC or with the Florida Current, only the flow across the entire Oleander line from the U.S. coast to Bermuda is correlated with climatic transport changes. Second, Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) analysis shows that SLDIF can detect (with lag) the portion of the variations in the AMOC transport that are associated with the Florida Current and the wind-driven Ekman transport (SLDIF-transport correlations of similar to 0.7-0.9). The SLDIF has thus been used to estimate variations in transport since 1935 and compared with AMOC obtained from reanalysis data. The significant weakening in AMOC after similar to 2000 (similar to 4.5 Sv per decade) is comparable to weakening seen in the 1960s to early 1970s. Both periods of weakening AMOC, in the 1960s and 2000s, are characterized by faster than normal sea level rise along the northeastern U.S. coast, so monitoring changes in AMOC has practical implications for coastal protection.

1,"Trees provide ecosystem services that counter negative effects of urban habitats on human and environmental health. Unfortunately, herbivorous arthropod pests are often more abundant on urban than rural trees, reducing tree growth, survival, and ecosystem services. Previous research where vegetation complexity was reduced has attributed elevated urban pest abundance to decreased regulation by natural enemies. However, reducing vegetation complexity, particularly the density of overstory trees, also makes cities hotter than natural habitats. We ask how urban habitat characteristics influence an abiotic factor, temperature, and a biotic factor, natural enemy abundance, in regulating the abundance of an urban forest pest, the gloomy scale, (Melanaspis tenebricosa). We used a map of surface temperature to select red maple trees (Acer rubrum) at warmer and cooler sites in Raleigh, North Carolina, USA. We quantified habitat complexity by measuring impervious surface cover, local vegetation structural complexity, and landscape scale vegetation cover around each tree. Using path analysis, we determined that impervious surface (the most important habitat variable) increased scale insect abundance by increasing tree canopy temperature, rather than by reducing natural enemy abundance or percent parasitism. As a mechanism for this response, we found that increasing temperature significantly increases scale insect fecundity and contributes to greater population increase. Specifically, adult female M. tenebricosa egg sets increased by approximately 14 eggs for every 1 degrees C increase in temperature. Climate change models predict that the global climate will increase by 2-3 degrees C in the next 50-100 years, which we found would increase scale insect abundance by three orders of magnitude. This result supports predictions that urban and natural forests will face greater herbivory in the future, and suggests that a primary cause could be direct, positive effects of wauning on herbivore fitness rather than altered trophic interactions."
1,"Glacier -fed waters create strong environmental filtering for biota, whereby different organisms may assume distinct distribution patterns. By using environmental DNA -based metabarcoding, we investigated the multi -group biodiversity distribution patterns of the Parlung No. 4 Glacier, on the Tibetan Plateau. Altogether, 642 taxa were identified from the meltwater stream and the downstream Ranwu Lake, including 125 cyanobacteria, 316 diatom, 183 invertebrate, and 18 vertebrate taxa. As the distance increased from the glacier terminus, community complexity increased via sequential occurrences of cyanobacteria, diatoms, invertebrates, and vertebrates, as well as increasing taxa numbers. The stream and lake showed different community compositions and distinct taxa. Furthermore, the correlations with environmental factors and community assembly mechanisms showed group- and habitat -specific patterns. Our results reveal the rapid spatial succession and increasing community complexity along glacial flowpaths and highlight the varying adaptivity of different organisms, while also providing insight into the ecosystem responses to global change."
0,"This study addresses the critical need to report original and current findings on the global food system's ability to meet the growing natural resource demands of an estimated 9 billion global population. The objective is to provide guidance for researchers in developing strategies to reduce climate change risks in the food and beverage supply. To achieve this, we propose integrating innovative industry insights and digital applications into existing food system models as industrial demonstrators. Our research encompasses six impactful themes, demonstrating effective delivery methodologies. We highlight that human-centred activities and practices, often overlooked in sustainability assessments, hinder improved security and sustainability in the food system. Through our work, we showcase how smarter food production processes, along with active citizen engagement, can achieve desired outcomes outlined in frameworks, such as the Sustainable Development Goals. A crucial aspect is the development of Internet of Things (IoT) platforms, integrating workforce practices into manufacturing activities, and driving the necessary cultural changes for a sustainable food system. This study illuminates challenges faced by the global food system and provides actionable insights and methodologies to guide researchers and industry stakeholders in creating a more sustainable and secure future for food production and consumption."
1,"Biological invasions coupled with climate change drive changes in marine biodiversity. Warming climate and changes in hydrology may either enable or hinder the spread of non-indigenous species (NIS) and little is known about how climate change modifies the richness and impacts of NIS in specific sea areas. We calculated from climate change simulations (RCO-SCOBI model) the changes in summer time conditions which northern Baltic Sea may to go through by the end of the twenty-first century, e.g., 2-5 A degrees C sea surface temperature rise and even up to 1.75 unit decrease in salinity. We reviewed the temperature and salinity tolerances (i.e., physiological tolerances and occurrence ranges in the field) of pelagic and benthic NIS established in-or with dispersal potential to-the northern Baltic Sea, and assessed how climate change will likely affect them. Our findings suggest a future decrease in barnacle larvae and an increase in Ponto-Caspian cladocerans in the pelagic community. In benthos, polychaetes, gastropods and decapods may become less abundant. By contrast, dreissenid bivalves, amphipods and mysids are expected to widen their distribution and increase in abundance in the coastal areas of the northern Baltic Sea. Potential salinity decrease acts as a major driver for NIS biogeography in the northern Baltic Sea, but temperature increase and extended summer season allow higher reproduction success in bivalves, zooplankton, amphipods and mysids. Successful NIS, i.e., coastal crustacean and bivalve species, pose a risk to native biota, as many of them have already demonstrated harmful effects in the Baltic Sea."
1,"Large-scale ecosystem disturbances (LSEDs) have major impacts on the global carbon cycle as large pulses of CO2 and other trace gases from terrestrial biomass loss are emitted to the atmosphere during disturbance events. The high temporal and spatial variability of the atmospheric emissions combined with the lack of a proven methodology to monitor LSEDs at the global scale make the timing, location and extent of vegetation disturbance a significant uncertainty in understanding the global carbon cycle. The MODIS Global Disturbance Index (MGDI) algorithm is designed for large-scale, regular, disturbance mapping using Aqua/Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Aqua/MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data. The MGDI uses annual maximum composite LST data to detect fundamental changes in land-surface energy partitioning, while avoiding the high natural variability associated with tracking LST at daily, weekly, or seasonal time frames. Here we apply the full Aqua/MODIS dataset through 2006 to the improved MGDI algorithm across the woody ecosystems of North America and test the algorithm by comparison with confirmed, historical wildfire events and the windfall areas of documented major hurricanes. The MGDI accurately detects the location and extent of wildfire throughout North America and detects high and moderate severity impacts in the windfall area of major hurricanes. We also find detections associated with clear-cut logging and land-clearing on the forest-agricultural interface. The MGDI indicates that 1.5% (195,580 km(2)) of the woody ecosystems within North America was disturbed in 2005 and 0.5% (67,451 km(2)) was disturbed in 2006. The interannual variability is supported by wildfire detections and official burned area statistics. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
0,"This paper is a reflective historical survey of how Australia, despite its affluence, has not delivered 'the good life' to poor Australians, both indigenous and non-indigenous. It argues that, contrary to our national mythology, this country was founded on institutionalised social inequality and on the exclusion of Indigenous people from land rights, property and equal citizenship. As one of the world's twenty richest countries, we perform poorly across a wide range of social and health indicators because we suffer from entrenched, systemic and growing inequality. If we are to survive the challenges that face us from climate change and the global financial crisis, we need to shape policies that mitigate income and social inequality and that promote inclusion and better social cohesion."
0,"For conservation science to effectively inform management, research must focus on creating the scientific knowledge required to solve conservation problems. We identified research questions that, if answered, would increase the effectiveness of conservation and natural resource management practice and policy in Oceania's small-island developing states. We asked conservation professionals from academia, governmental, and nongovernmental organizations across the region to propose such questions and then identify which were of high priority in an online survey. We compared the high-priority questions with research questions identified globally and for other regions. Of 270 questions proposed by respondents, 38 were considered high priority, including: What are the highest priority areas for conservation in the face of increasing resource demand and climate change? How should marine protected areas be networked to account for connectivity and climate change? What are the most effective fisheries management policies that contribute to sustainable coral reef fisheries? High-priority questions related to the particular challenges of undertaking conservation on small-island developing states and the need for a research agenda that is responsive to the sociocultural context of Oceania. Research priorities for Oceania relative to elsewhere were broadly similar but differed in specific issues relevant to particular conservation contexts. These differences emphasize the importance of involving local practitioners in the identification of research priorities. Priorities were reasonably well aligned among sectoral groups. Only a few questions were widely considered answered, which may indicate a smaller-than-expected knowledge-action gap. We believe these questions can be used to strengthen research collaborations between scientists and practitioners working to further conservation and natural resource management in this region."
1,"The objective of the study was to assess farmer perceptions on effects of drought on cattle production in sub-tropical environments. Data was collected from a total of 314 cattle-owning households from semi-arid and sub-humid environments using pre-tested structured questionnaires. Drought was highly ranked common cause of cattle loss in semi-arid (ranked third) whilst in sub-humid conditions it was lowly ranked (ranked sixth; P<0.05). Water shortage was ranked as the constituent of drought with the most severe impact on cattle production in semi-arid environments whilst in sub-humid environments feed shortage was ranked first (P<0.05). Mortalities were ranked as the most common effect of drought in semi-arid environments whilst in sub-humid environments parasite incidence was ranked first (P<0.01). Lactating and pregnant cows in sub-humid environments were more likely to be emaciated during droughts periods than those in semi-arid environments (P?0.05). Starvation, a stressor which is directly related to drought, was the major cause of cattle losses in sub-humid environments. Diseases and parasites, which can be exacerbated by drought, were the major cause of cattle losses in semi-arid environments. Cows and calves are more vulnerable to emaciation during drought periods in sub-humid environments than in semi-arid environments."
1,"This study aimed to better document the diversity and distribution patterns of vascular cryophilous species across major habitat types in a high-elevation Mediterranean system in central Italy. The research addressed the following questions: (a) whether different habitats support similar levels of biodiversity in terms of total vascular plants richness and cryophilous species richness, and (b) how each habitat contributes to the total cryophilous species diversity. A random stratified sampling approach based on a habitat map was applied to construct rarefaction curves for overall cryophilous species richness and habitat type-specific cryophilous richness. Rarefaction curves were also constructed for all-species and exclusive species. To determine whether the targeted species represented a constant proportion of all species, the ratio between the rarefaction curves of the cryophilous species and all species was also calculated. The results highlight the importance of the different habitat types in overall and cryophilous species conservation because these different habitat types had progressively higher richness values. At the regional scale, steep slopes had the highest species diversity, the greatest exclusive species richness and a steep rarefaction curve. The diversity pattern of cryophilous taxa was not related to the general pattern of total species richness, with these species being more common in three habitat types with extreme environmental conditions: ridges, cliffs, and screes. For the establishment of successful biodiversity conservation programs, it is imperative to include species-poor habitats containing a high proportion of cryophilous species, which are considered to be threatened by climate warming."
1,"The contribution of carbonate-producing benthic organisms to the global marine carbon budget has been overlooked, the prevailing view being that calcium carbonate (CaCO3) is predominantly produced and exported by marine plankton in the biological pump.'' Here, we provide the first estimation of the global contribution of echinoderms to the marine inorganic and organic carbon cycle, based on organism-level measurements from species of the five echinoderm classes. Echinoderms' global CaCO3 contribution amounts to similar to 0.861 Pg CaCO3/yr (0.102 Pg C/yr of inorganic carbon) as a production rate, and similar to 2.11 Pg CaCO3 (0.25 Pg C of inorganic carbon) as a standing stock from the shelves, slopes, and abyssal depths. Echinoderm inorganic carbon production (0.102 Pg C/yr) is less than the global pelagic production (0.4-1.8 Pg C/yr) and similar to the estimates for carbonate shelves globally (0.024-0.120 Pg C/yr). Echinoderm CaCO3 production per unit area is similar to 27.01 g CaCO3.m(-2).yr(-1) (3.24 g C.m(-2).yr(-1) as inorganic carbon) on a global scale for all areas, with a standing stock of similar to 63.34 g CaCO3/m(2) (7.60 g C/m(2) as inorganic carbon), and similar to 7.97 g C/m(2) as organic carbon. The shelf production alone is 77.91 g CaCO3.m(-2).yr(-1) (9.35 g C.m(-2).yr(-1) as inorganic carbon) in contrast to 2.05 g CaCO3.m(-2).yr(-1) (0.24 g C.m(-2).yr(-1) as inorganic carbon) for the slope on a global scale. The biogeography of the CaCO3 standing stocks of echinoderms showed strong latitudinal variability. More than 80% of the global CaCO3 production from echinoderms occurs between 0 and 800 m, with the highest contribution attributed to the shelf and upper slope. We provide a global distribution of echinoderm populations in the context of global calcite saturation horizons, since undersaturated waters with respect to mineral phases are surfacing. This shallowing is a direct consequence of ocean acidification, and in some places it may reach the shelf and upper slope permanently, where the highest CaCO3 standing stocks from echinoderms originate. These organism-level data contribute substantially to the assessment of global carbonate inventories, which at present are poorly estimated. Additionally, it is desirable to include these benthic compartments in coupled global biogeochemical models representing the biological pump'' and its feedbacks, since at present all efforts have focused on pelagic processes, dominated by coccolithophores. The omission of the benthic processes from modeling will only diminish the understanding of elemental fluxes at large scales and any future prediction of climate change scenarios."
1,"Wildfire activity is increasing around the world, concurrent with climate change, and mitigation strategies for protecting vulnerable populations are desperately needed. Because inhaled particles are deleterious to respiratory health, particularly among older adults with co-morbidities, we engaged maintenance personnel working in long term care facilities located in the Western US. Our objective was to identify opportunities to build resilience during wildfire smoke events. We implemented a virtual workshop that addressed wildfire smoke health impacts as well as strategies to assess and maintain indoor air quality. A total of 24 maintenance personnel attended the virtual workshop and 14 participated in a quantitative survey. Workshop attendees found value in the material and there was enthusiasm for educational resources and enhancing indoor air quality. Four months later, four maintenance staff participated in a follow-up interview. Our qualitative assessment revealed the following themes: awareness and prioritization, application of knowledge, barriers, and educational resources. Access to real-time actionable air quality data was a consistent feature across these themes. Maintenance personnel could play a key role in a facility's ability to prepare for and respond to wildfire smoke events, and this study highlights potential challenges and opportunities to involving them in resilience building strategies."
0,"BackgroundPosttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) are common after acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and predict increased morbidity and mortality. Climate change contributes to worse mental and cardiovascular health outcomes, thus, PTSS represent a potential mechanism linking climate change to adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Because people living in areas with lower socioeconomic status (SES) experience greater climate vulnerability, have worse cardiovascular health, and may be more susceptible to PTSS, any effect of temperature on PTSS could be amplified in this population. MethodsSpatial regression models were estimated to test the association of temperature and temperature variability (within-day variability, directed change over time, and absolute change over time), census tract-level SES, and their interaction with PTSS 1 month post-hospital discharge in a longitudinal cohort study comprising 956 patients evaluated for ACS at an urban U.S. academic medical center between November 2013-May 2017. PTSS were self-reported in relation to the ACS event that brought the patient to the hospital. Census tract-level was computed as a composite score from the CDC Social Vulnerability Index, with higher values indicating lower SES. ResultsNo temperature or temperature variability metrics were associated with PTSS. Lower census tract-level SES was associated with greater PTSS at 1 month. There was a marginally significant interaction of SES with ACS status, such that we only observed evidence of an association among those with ACS. ConclusionTemperature exposures were not associated with acute CVD-induced PTSS, which could be a result of a small sample size, mismatched timescale, or lack of a true effect. Conversely, lower census tract-level SES was associated with developing worse PTSS 1 month after evaluation for an ACS. This association appeared stronger in individuals with a true ACS. Early interventions to prevent PTSS could promote better mental and CVD outcomes in this at-risk population."
1,"Aim Incorporate species' trait information together with climate projections for associated habitat to assess the potential vulnerability of rodent taxa to climate change. Location Oaxaca State, Mexico. Methods We used a trait-based approach together with climate exposure models to evaluate the vulnerability of rodent species to projected climate conditions in the study region. Vulnerability was estimated based on three factors: (a) Level of climatic exposure that species are projected to experience across their current statewide range; (b) inherent species-specific sensitivity to stochastic events; and (c) species' capacity to cope with climate change effects. We defined species as inherently sensitive if they had any of the following: restricted geographic distribution in Mexico; narrow altitudinal range; low dispersal ability; or long generation length. Results Vulnerability varied depending on the climate change scenario applied. Under the MPI general circulation model and current emissions trends, by 2099, all species evaluated were projected to have some level of threat (vulnerable for at least one factor), with 4 out of 55 species vulnerable for all three factors, 29 for two factors, and 22 for one factor. Six out of ten rodent species endemic to Oaxaca were vulnerable for two or more factors. We found that species with narrow and restricted-range distributions combined with low adaptive capacity were projected to be particularly vulnerable. Main conclusions By including species-specific trait information in climate exposure assessments, researchers can contextualize and enhance their understanding about how climate change is likely to affect individual taxa in an area of interest. As such, studies like this one provide more relevant threat assessment information than exposure analyses alone and serve as a starting point for considering how climatic changes interact with an array of other variables to affect native species across their range."
0,"In response to intensifying wildfire seasons, scholars call for new wildfire policy and management approaches. Based on the assumption that science, policy, and management are integrated spheres of meaning-making, this article aims to contribute to reflective and creative research conversations about fire policy and management by directing analytical attention to the role of science. Using Causal Layered Analysis, we unpack scientific representations of three wildfire events/seasons in Sweden, the US, and Australia. The analysis illustrates that scientific representations of wildfires are contextual and promote particular policy recommendations and management interventions. Furthermore, the review identifies a discrepancy between dominant, more simplistic representations and the dynamic and complex representation emerging from an interdisciplinary reading of the literature. To address this discrepancy, we argue that there is a need to continuously renegotiate the boundaries of wildfires through rethinking the process underpinning the scientific representations to account for the complexity inherent in wildfire events."

0,"Declines of amphibian populations have been a worldwide issue of concern for the scientific community during the last several decades. Efforts are being carried out to elucidate factors related to this phenomenon. Among these factors, pathogens, climate change, and environmental pollution have been suggested as possible causes. Regarding environmental pollutants, some pesticides are persistent in the environment and capable of being transported long distances from their release point. In Costa Rica, some pesticides have been detected in protected areas, at locations where amphibian populations have declined. Information about toxicity of pesticides used in Costa Rican agriculture to amphibians is still scarce, particularly for native species. Toxicity tests with chlorothalonil, a fungicide intensively used in Costa Rica, were carried out exposing tadpoles of three Costa Rican native species: Agalychnis callidryas, Isthmohyla pseudopuma, and Smilisca baudinii in order to evaluate acute and chronic toxicity as well as the biomarkers cholinesterase activity (ChE), glutathione-S transferase activity (GST), and lipid peroxidation (LPO). 96-h LC50: 26.6 (18.9-35.8) mu g/L to A. callidryas, 25.5 (21.3-29.7) mu g/L to I pseudopuma and 32.3 (26.3-39.7) mu g/L to S. baudinii were determined for chlorothalonil. These three species of anurans are among the most sensitive to chlorothalonil according to the literature. Besides, GST was induced in S. baudinii after exposure to sub-lethal concentrations of chlorothalonil while evisceration occurred in S. baudinii and A. callidryas tadpoles exposed to lethal concentrations of the fungicide. Chronic exposure to sub-lethal concentrations accelerated development in S. baudinii and caused lesions in tail of S. baudinii and I. pseudopuma tadpoles. Our results demonstrate that chlorothalonil is highly toxic to native amphibian species and that low concentrations can cause biochemical responses related to phase II of biotransformation and effects on development."
1,"Probable maximum precipitation (PMP) is defined as the greatest depth of precipitation that is physically possible over a particular location after a storm. Changes in the frequency and intensity of precipitation extremes associated with climate change may alter established PMP values, calling for updated approaches for estimating PMP to inform water resources management. In this study, we established a framework to update PMP for Hong Kong, a major coastal metropolis in south China where precipitation extremes are intensifying in a changing climate. The methods explored are adaptations of a traditional statistical method, a local storm moisture maximization method, and a storm transposition method. As inputs to the associated models, (1) data from annual maximum rainfall series at various durations (4-, 6-, 12-, 24-h) from 1884 to 2015 in Hong Kong and its surrounding regions, Taiwan; (2) dewpoint data at an hourly resolution spanning from 1984 to 2015 in Hong Kong; and (3) hourly rainfall and dewpoint data observed during three major typhoons in Taiwan were incorporated. Although our data were available until 2015, it is worth noting that no more recent extreme precipitation events have surpassed the values recorded during the study period. Finally, we present a new dataset of the updated point- and area-scale PMP values for Hong Kong for multiple durations (4-, 6-, 12-, 24-h). These updated values were assessed and verified to be reasonable through comparisons with regional storm records, PMP estimates from adjacent areas, and historical PMP values for Hong Kong. The updated PMP values for Hong Kong can serve as a reference for the design of hydraulic structures and preparation for extreme precipitation events. Further, the proposed framework for updating PMP values can be transferred to other coastal metropolises for flood design."
0,"The lack of proper wastewater treatment results in production Of CO2 and CH4 without the opportunity for carbon sequestration and energy recovery, with deleterious effects for global warming. Without extending wastewater treatment to all urban areas worldwide, CO2 and CH4 emissions associated with wastewater discharges could reach the equivalent of 1.91 X 10(5) t(CO2) d(-1) in 2025, with even more dramatic impact in the short-term. The carbon sequestration benefits of wastewater treatment have enormous potential, which adds an energy conservation incentive to upgrading existing facilities to complete wastewater treatment. The potential greenhouse gases discharges which can be converted to a net equivalent CO2 credit can be as large as 1.21 x 10(4) t(CO2) d(-1) by 2025. Biomass sequestration and biogas conversion energy recovery are the two main strategies for carbon sequestration and emission offset, respectively. The greatest potential for improvement is outside Europe and North America, which have largely completed treatment plant construction. Europe and North America can partially offset their CO2 emissions and receive benefits through the carbon emission trading system, as established by the Kyoto protocol, by extending existing technologies or subsidizing wastewater treatment plant construction in urban areas lacking treatment. This strategy can help mitigate global warming, in addition to providing a sustainable solution for extending the health, environmental, and humanitarian benefits of proper sanitation.

1,"Community forestry around the world has demonstrated its potential for implementing the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) climate change program. Secure tenure rights and access to rule-making are known as contributing to successful community forestry outcomes. Still, the effects of different aspects of rural 'community agency' are not well established. We investigate forest governance and conflicts and the relationships between aspects of rural community agency under the REDD+ climate change program in two forest communities-the villages of Fabe and Mosongiseli-near the southern portion of the Korup National Park in Cameroon. Using data from a survey instrument and interviews, we analyze, using agency theory, the concept of rural community agency according to dimensions of attitudes, understandings, and empowerment in the two communities in relation to forest governance and conflicts under REDD+. Our findings indicate a variety of power relations (e.g., on the communities' use and management rights of their lands) and existential threats of conflicts within the communities (e.g., violation of the communities' free, prior, and informed consent). The results also show that both communities share many of the patterns of diversity and integration to a similar extent. Although there is no definitive distinction between the two communities, the findings suggest that some differences exist in their degree of integration. Understanding and describing the nature of the power relations and threats of conflicts comprises an important component to begin an appreciation for the communities' user group characteristics as these relate to the REDD+ program when implemented. The implication of this study is that threats of conflicts may increase when the villagers' perception of the potential costs of losing their lands to REDD+ is formed by their experiences with current restrictions on the use and management rights of their lands."
1,"Saltmarshes, wetlands, inter-tidal mudflats are highly productive natural ecosystems with significant ecological value. Pb-210 and Cs-137 have been used for establishing chronologies at a centennial scale in these sediments. They are relevant for assessing how saltmarshes are vulnerable to climate change, natural hazards and contamination from human inputs. This paper aims to review and adapt existing methods for the Pb-210-based radiometric dating of these sediments where the subterranean production and decay of OM are sources of achronicity. This limits the use of the basic assumption of considering the sediment as a continuous medium. From the available evidence, Pb-210 fluxes onto sediments may be mediated by the activities bound to the mass flows, suggesting that models assuming a constant flux should be handled with care. The activity concentrations of excess Pb-210 required by CF-CS, CIC and TERESA radiometric models must be those of the sediment mineral fraction, while CRS and PLUM can work with the composite sediment matrix. A review of these issues and application of the models is illustrated with new data from two recent saltmarsh sediment cores. The effects of non-ideal boundary conditions in radiometric dating and the system time-average of Cs-137 fluxes are discussed. Although specific to vegetated saltmarshes, this topic and the present results have generic applications for other vegetated coastal sediments."
1,"Technology-based solutions warrant to guide farmers and agronomists towards more efficient use of irrigation water. Indeed, wise irrigation practices are urgently required to overcome the increasing shortage of water resources due to the impact of climate change and the competition for water resources with other activities. With the aim of moving from traditional water management to advanced precision irrigation, we designed the Agricolus (R) platform. Here, we describe the approach used in building the platform, which integrates a set of different IT tools: sensors, farm management system, mathematical models, remotely sensed indices and decision support system. Agricolus (R) will provide the final user with an easy-to-use integrated interface to properly assess the irrigation requirement and to finely schedule the water supply."
1,"The summer of 2004 was one of the largest fire seasons on record for Alaska and western Canada. We construct a daily bottom-up fire emission inventory for that season, including consideration of peat burning and high-altitude (buoyant) injection, and evaluate it in a global chemical transport model (the GEOS-Chem CTM) simulation of CO through comparison with MOPITT satellite and ICARTT aircraft observations. The inventory is constructed by combining daily area burned reports and MODIS fire hot spots with estimates of fuel consumption and emission factors based on ecosystem type. We estimate the contribution from peat burning using drainage and peat distribution maps for Alaska and Canada; 17% of the reported 5.1 x 10(6) ha burned were located in peatlands in 2004. Our total estimate of North American fire emissions during the summer of 2004 is 30 Tg CO, including 11 Tg from peat. Including peat burning in the GEOS-Chem simulation improves agreement with MOPITT observations. The long-range transport of fire plumes observed by MOPITT suggests that the largest fires injected a significant fraction of their emissions in the upper troposphere."
1,"Regenerative agriculture is an alternative approach to farming that has been gaining traction and interest among farmers due to its potential to reduce input costs, improve soil health, and increase the resilience of farming systems. This paper undertakes a practice-based analysis of farmers, applying a lens of regenerative agriculture. Surveys were developed as a part of a broader project using an established methodological framework. Topics were developed and adapted with input from local stakeholders before being mailed out to three farming regions across Australia (the Western Australian Wheatbelt, the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia and Central West New South Wales). The research clustered farmers into two groups: those who are using best-practices that fall inside the scope of regenerative agriculture, and those who are not. The similarities and differences in farmer attributes, as well as self-reported knowledge levels and information sources used by each group are explored. Results indicate that a belief in anthropogenic climate change may be one of the primary divides between the two groups, and therefore a possible driver of best-practice implementation. The findings provide insight into per-ceptions of regenerative agriculture for Australian farmers, and may assist with knowledge dissemination amongst those managing our environment."
1,"Regulated rivers often have associated wetlands with declining ecological health due to reduced inundation frequency. One innovative option to improve the ecological condition of such wetlands is to use them as temporary off-river water storages, where the water used to inundate them is subsequently allocated to consumptive use. The hydrologic feasibility of this option has yet to be demonstrated. We investigated three physical aspects of a floodplain wetlands system that must be considered, relative to irrigation demand, to determine feasibility: (a) historical inundation frequencies and the effect of regulation and climate change, (b) natural storage volumes and enhanced volumes using retaining walls, and (c) estimated loss rates. We found that inundation frequencies are reduced under regulation and that this reduction is even greater for projected climate change scenarios. Natural volumes were found to be 5% of annual irrigation demand, increasing to 20% with retaining walls; a small proportion at the system scale but significant at farm scale, especially with opportunities for multiple fillings per season. Losses are estimated at 36%-63% of the initial volume, depending on timing of wetland inundation and drawdown. Careful consideration must be applied to issues of frequency and timing of inundation, drawdown rates, and connectivity when considering the ecological benefits of using wetlands as storages. Environmental benefits will be a trade-off with capital, operational, and maintenance costs and water pricing. Key Points Floodplain wetland health is declining and watering opportunities are required Using irrigation water firstly in wetlands can restore a more natural hydrology At a farm scale wetlands can provide up to 20% of annual irrigation demand"
1,"Kenya's small scale coral reef fisheries are extensively studied yet a practical understanding of the resilience and status of the main target species remains largely elusive to the manager. We combined a range of fishery and fish population descriptors to analyse Kenya's coral reef fish and fisheries over a 20 year period from the 1980s, to determine the sustainability of current fishing levels and provide recommendations for management. Fishers reported over 13 different artisanal fishing gears of which there are data for only the five widely used gears. Average catch rates declined 4-fold from the mid 1980s (13.7 +/- 1.6 kg/fisher/trip) to the 1990s (3.2 +/- 0.1 kg/fisher/trip) and then stabilized. Species richness in catches of these historically multi-species fisheries declined dramatically and by 2007 only 2-3 species appeared in the top bracket (65-75% by number) with Siganus sutor (African whitespotted rabbitfish) and Leptoscarus vaigiensis (marbled parrotfish) consistently being in this bracket in beach seine, gill net and basket trap catches, contributing up to a maximum of 45% and 47% of the catch, respectively. Lethrinus bor-bonicus dominated handline catches (50%). Relatively stable catch rates are reported from the 1990s to the mid 2000s, likely maintained by shifting proportions of species in the catches. Patterns in fish population densities over time show National Parks have helped increase densities of Lethrinidae and Haemulidae and reduced the decline in densities of Scaridae and Acanthuridae, but that National Reserves have had no positive effect. We suggest that the National Parks, which are No Take Zones (NTZs), and the fisheries regulations inside and outside of Reserves are inadequate for maintaining or restoring reef fishery target families under current levels of fishery exploitation. We propose that recruitment overfishing of several species and insufficient areas under full protection, all exacerbated by climate change, are contributing to driving Kenya's artisanal coral reef fisheries to a tipping point. We recommend species-specific management options, changes in and enforcement of gear regulations and many more effective NTZs are needed urgently if these fisheries are to continue to provide livelihoods and food security on the Kenyan coast.

0,"Hubbell's neutral theory of biodiversity is used to investigate the decline in species richness from the tropics to the poles. On this basis, biodiversity should correlate with productivity or climate (there is strong statistical evidence for this), with the latitudinal width of the continents (insufficiently investigated as yet), and with the speciation rate (which may not vary in such a way as to produce a planetary gradient). According to the neutral, model, biodiversity will vary with the area of the metacommunity: it is suggested that at higher latitudes species disperse most readily east-west, within their climatic belt, but that the relatively uniform temperature across the intertropical belt allows isotropic dispersal there. Metacommunities within the tropics may therefore be an order of magnitude larger than those at other latitudes. This could explain the extra bulge in the gradient in the tropics. It is further possible that long-term and cyclical climate change generates a tropic-pole gradient. Niche assembly models wilt also explain tropical biodiversity, but the enhanced division of habitat may be the result, not the cause, of the species richness. The neutrality-competition debate in ecology closely parallels the neutrality-natural selection debate in evolution and may be equally hard to resolve. (C) 2004 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved."
1,"Low temperatures represent the most important environmental stress for plants at the treeline ecotone; however, drought periods at the semiarid treeline could modify photosynthetic performance patterns. Gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, photosynthetic pigments, and alpha-tocopherol were measured in a Pinus canariensis forest located at a semiarid treeline forest at 2070 m altitude over a whole year. The level of summer drought, caused by an extended period without rain and very low previous rainfall, was remarkable during the study. Furthermore, the cold season showed extraordinarily low temperatures, which persisted for five months. All of these factors combined made the study period an extraordinary opportunity to improve our understanding of photosynthetic performance in a drought-affected treeline ecotone. A high dynamism in all the measured parameters was detected, showing robust changes over the year. Maximum photosynthesis and optimal values were concentrated over a short period in spring. Beyond that, fine regulation in stomatal closure, high WUEi with a great plasticity, and changes in pigments and antioxidative components prevented dehydration during drought. In winter, a strong chronic photoinhibition was detected, and alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene acquired a main role as protective molecules, accompanied by morphological variations as changes in specific leaf areas to avoid freezing. The recovery in the next spring, i.e., after these extreme environmental conditions returned to normal, showed a strategy based on the breakdown of pigments and lower photosynthetic functions during the winter, and rebuilding and regreening. So, a high level of plasticity, together with some structural and physiological adaptations, make P. canariensis able to cope with stresses at the treeline. Nevertheless, the carbon gain was more limited by drought than by low temperatures and more extended droughts predicted in future climate change scenarios may strongly affect this forest."
1,"Mycotoxin contamination of agricultural commodities is a global public health problem that has remained elusive to various mitigation approaches, particularly in developing countries. Climate change and its impact exacerbates South Africa's vulnerability to mycotoxin contamination, and significantly threatens its's food systems, public health, and agro-economic development. Herein we analyse sixteen years (2005/2006-2020/2021) of annual national meteorological data on South Africa which reveals both systematic and erratic variability in critical climatic factors known to influence mycotoxin contamination in crops. Within the same study period, data on fumonisin (FB) monitoring show clear climate-dependent trends. The strongest positive warming trend is observed between 2018/2019 and 2019/2020 (0.51 degrees C/year), and a strong positive correlation is likewise established between FB contamination and temperature (r ranging from 0.6 to 0.9). Four machine learning models, viz support vector machines, eXtreme gradient boosting, random forest, and orthogonal partial least squares, are generalized on the historical data with suitable performance (RMSE as low as 0.00). All the adopted models are able to predict future FB contamination patterns with reasonable precision (R2 ranging from 0.34 to 1.00). The most important model feature for predicting average FB contamination (YA) is the historical pattern of average FB contamination in maize within the region (Sigma FBs_avg). The two most significant features in modelling maximum FB contamination (YM) are minimum temperature from the CMIP6 data (Pro_tempMIN) and observed precipitation from the CRU data (O_prep). Our study provides strong evidence of the impact of climate change on FB in South Africa and reiterates the significance of machine learning modelling in predicting mycotoxin contamination in light of changing climatic conditions, which could facilitate early warnings and the adoption of relevant mitigation measures that could help in mycotoxin risk management and control."
0,"Recent years have seen unprecedented pressure from numerous water stakeholders with different interests in Lake Naivasha basin, the only freshwater lake in the Great Rift Valley of Kenya. The pressure on this water resource results in high competition over access to water source, unsustainable resources management practices, poor water quality, and emergence of conflicts between institutions and its users. Presently, there is a knowledge gap and paucity of information on water resources stakeholders' interactions in Lake Naivasha basin. This study, therefore, analyses the ways resource stakeholders interact and play in the conflict dynamic, and ultimately propose a better water resource use and management approaches. Drawing on field assessments, individual interviews, focus group discussion, and secondary literature reviews, this paper illustrates how both local, national and multi-national stakeholders interact and contribute to water resources conflicts. Results suggest unclear county and national institutional structures, fragmented land use activities and ownership, a feeling of marginalization by the local population contributing to resource-based conflict within the lake basin. A comprehensive policy framework and enforcement of existing regulations will ensure there is sustainable water access, reduce conflicts and enhance sustainable water resource governance and use of the lake."
0,"This paper examines trends in woody vegetation and tree species composition in the Sudan zone of West Africa, using the Kano region of northern Nigeria as a case study. The study compares data on tree density, fuelwood production and tree species composition from fieldwork conducted in 1981 and 2016, as well as on several dates of aerial and satellite images since the 1960s. Recent satellite-based reports of greening in arid West Africa as a response to recovery from droughts in the 1970s and 1980s, are examined to explain the observed trends. Tree densities in the goods and services hinterland of Kano city have at least doubled since the drought period, and no decline, rather a slight increase was observed during the drought decades. This contradicts reports of woody vegetation trends from the more arid and less densely populated Sahel zone, which generally observed decline during the drought years and current recovery to pre-drought levels. The remarkable increase in tree numbers in Kano region is accompanied by increasing fuelwood production as suggested by greater concentration by farmers on tree species highly valued for fuel, at the expense of other traditional species. The main driver of such trends is thought to be rapid population growth in the context of a remaining dependence on wood as fuel by both urban and rural populations in Nigeria. Climate is thought to play only a minor role in explaining the trends. These observations confirm trends in fuelwood production observed in Kano region more than three decades previously, and indicate a somewhat Boserupian response to Malthusian-type pressures on available resources. Nevertheless, a return to rainfall levels of the drought decades combined with climate change predictions of increasing temperatures in dryland Africa, may have serious consequences for rural households if energy sources are not diversified."
0,"This article presents the first bottom-up analysis of the proportion of global marine fisheries subsidies to small-scale fisheries (SSF). Using existing data, the reported national subsidy amounts are split into the fraction that goes to small- and large-scale fishing sectors. Results reveal a major imbalance in subsidy distribution, with SSF receiving only about 16% of the total global fisheries subsidy amount of $35 billion in 2009. To bring this into perspective, a person engaged in large-scale fishing received around 4 times the amount of subsidies received by their SSF counterparts. Furthermore, almost 90% of capacity-enhancing subsidies, which are known to exacerbate overfishing go to large-scale fisheries, thus increasing the unfair competitive advantage that large-scale fisheries already have. The developmental, economic and social consequences of this inequity are huge and impair the economic viability of the already vulnerable small-scale fishing sector. Conclusions indicate that taxpayers' money should be used to support sustainable fishing practices and in turn ocean conservation, and not to foster the degradation of marine ecosystems, often a result of capacity-enhancing subsidies. Reducing capacity-enhancing subsidies will have minimal negative effects on SSF communities since they receive very little of these subsidies to begin with. Instead, it will help correct the existing inequality, enhance SSF economic viability, and promote global fisheries sustainability."
1,"The low nitrogen (N)-use efficiency of intensive winter oilseed rape (WOSR) cropping systems may cause negative environmental impacts, especially due to N leaching and gaseous losses. The aim of this study was to use data from field experiments (five sites across Germany representing typical WOSR regions) for parametrization of a nitrous oxide (N2O) emission component for implementation into a process-based dynamic plant-soil-atmosphere model (PSAM). After calibration and evaluation with three years of field data from five different N fertilizer treatments, a long-term simulation with 25-year historical weather data was conducted to derive functional relations and emission factors (EFs). The model performed best at higher aggregation levels (cumulative emissions over the entire cropping period, R-2 of 0.48/0.77 for calibration/evaluation), but also reasonably simulated short-term dynamics (e.g., fertilizer applications, extreme weather events). Site-specific and year-specific N2O emissions varied within the range of medians from 0.56-4.93 kg N2O-N ha(-1). Mineral fertilizer-induced EFs at economic optimal N inputs ranged from 0.16-0.65%, which was markedly below the aggregated IPCC standard value of 1% for direct N2O emissions. Generally, the simulated emissions were consistently higher with finer soil textures and increasing N inputs. The process-based approach, moreover, allowed the identification of the major source of N2O, which mainly originated from nitrification processes."
1,"Madagascar is a low-income country, highly vulnerable to natural disasters affecting the small-scale sub-sistence farming system. Recently, climate change and environmental degradation have contributed to an intensification of food insecurity. We aim to monitor the link between dry and hot extremes on vegetation conditions, separated or concurrently, using satellite data, such as LST, ET, ET0, and FAPAR products from SEVIRI/MSG disseminated by LSASAF-EUMETSAT. The analysis was made for a long record from 2004 to 2021, focusing on the extreme seasons of 2020 and 2021. Results highlight the higher impact of combined dry and hot events when compared with isolated events, with a strong response of vegetation in the southern part of Madagascar. Results point to the added value of using the recent data records from geo-stationary satellites with high temporal resolution and updated in near real-time, to early detect, monitor, and characterize the impact of climate extremes on vegetation dynamics."
1,"Photosynthesis and respiration are major components of the plant carbon balance. During stress, like drought, carbohydrate supply from photosynthesis is reduced and the Krebs cycle respiration must be fueled with other stored carbon compounds. However, the dynamics of storage use are still unknown. The respiratory quotient (RQ, CO2 released per O-2 consumed during respiration) is an excellent indicator of the nature of the respiration substrate. In plant science, however, online RQ measurements have been challenging or even impossible so far due to very small gas exchange fluxes during respiration. Here we apply cavity-enhanced multi-gas Raman spectrometry (CERS) for online in situ RQ measurements in drought-tolerant pine (Pinus sylvestris [L.]) and drought-intolerant spruce (Picea abies [L. H. Karst]). Two different treatments, drought and shading, were applied to reduce photosynthesis and force dependency on stored substrates. Changes in respiration rates and RQ values were continuously monitored over periods of several days with low levels of variance. The results show that both species switched from COH-dominated respiration (RQ = 1.0) to a mixture of substrates during shading (RQ = 0.77-0.81), while during drought only pine did so (RQ = 0.75). The gas phase measurements were complemented by concentration measurements of non-structural carbohydrates and lipids. These first results suggest a physiological explanation for greater drought tolerance in pine. CERS was proven as powerful technique for non-consumptive and precise real-time monitoring of respiration rates and respirational quotients for the investigation of plant metabolism under drought stress conditions that are predicted to increase with future climate change."
1,"How carbohydrate reserves in conifers respond to drought and bark beetle attacks are poorly understood. We investigated changes in carbohydrate reserves and carbon-dependent diterpene defences in ponderosa pine trees that were experimentally subjected to two levels of drought stress (via root trenching) and two types of biotic challenge treatments (pheromone-induced bark beetle attacks or inoculations with crushed beetles that include beetle-associated fungi) for two consecutive years. Our results showed that trenching did not influence carbohydrates, whereas both biotic challenges reduced amounts of starch and sugars of trees. However, only the combined trenched-bark beetle attacked trees depleted carbohydrates and died during the first year of attacks. While live trees contained higher carbohydrates than dying trees, amounts of constitutive and induced diterpenes produced did not vary between live and beetle-attacked dying trees, respectively. Based on these results we propose that reallocation of carbohydrates to diterpenes during the early stages of beetle attacks is limited in drought-stricken trees, and that the combination of biotic and abiotic stress leads to tree death. The process of tree death is subsequently aggravated by beetle girdling of phloem, occlusion of vascular tissue by bark beetle-vectored fungi, and potential exploitation of host carbohydrates by bark beetle symbionts as nutrients."
1,"AimIn order to mitigate the ecological, economical and social consequences of future climate change, we must understand and quantify the response of vegetation to short-term climate anomalies. There is currently no model that quantifies vegetation resistance and resilience at a global scale while simultaneously taking climate variability into account. The goals of this study were therefore to develop a standardized indicator of short-term vegetation resilience and resistance to drought and temperature anomalies, and to improve our understanding of vegetation resistance and resilience in drought-sensitive areas by linking metrics of vegetation stability to the percentage of tree cover, non-tree vegetation and bare soil. LocationGlobal. MethodsThe deviation of vegetation behaviour from expectations was quantified using anomalies in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and modelled as a function of (1) past NDVI anomalies, (2) an instantaneous drought indicator and (3) temperature anomalies. Metrics of resistance and resilience were then extracted from the model and related to the percentages of bare soil, non-tree vegetation and tree cover. ResultsComparisons of the globally derived resilience and resistance metrics showed low resilience and low resistance to drought in semi-arid areas, low resistance to negative temperature anomalies in high-latitude areas, and low resistance to positive temperature anomalies in the Sahel and Australia. In drought-sensitive areas, resilience was highest for vegetation types with 3-20% bare soil and 5-15% tree cover. Main conclusionsOur ARx model is the first to simultaneously derive vegetation resistance and resilience metrics at a global scale, explicitly taking into account the spatial variability of short-term climate anomalies and data reliability. Its results highlight the impact of tree cover, non-tree vegetation and bare soil on vegetation resilience."
0,"Environmental Justice, as an influential movement in the USA, has generated significant policy outcomes because of executive mandate of its adoption in federal agencies. Whilst its initial premise emphasised health consequences of pollutants on underprivileged communities-particularly communities of colour-the concept has additional resonance as a correction to the dominant neo-liberal paradigm in natural resource management, particularly as it applies to rural and remote communities in Australia. This article uses the lense of environmental justice to consider climate change in Australia, considering in particular the effects of marketisation of the natural resource management issues."
0,"As climate change getting severer, finding an effective way to establish specie distribution model (SDM) becomes vital, and collecting terrain-related variable is efficient. Chamaecyparis formosensis (Taiwan red cypress, TRC) grow around ridges above 1,800m covered with dry soil or gravel. Abies kawakamii (Taiwan fir, TF) grow near ridges and peaks over 3,000m with impermeable terrain-shelterbelt that block away overwhelming moisture. We used digital elevation models (DEM) with four different grid sizes (1, 5, 20, and 40m) to derive variables. We used several types of machine learning algorithms to model SDMs. The most accurate algorithms are decision tree and random forest, and the most suitable resolution is 5m. Elevation and topographic sheltering index are necessary for developing SDMs, and models can be more precise and accurate with using multiple layers of TSIs. As for different species, TRC tends to be majorly influenced by main high ridgeline, and TF is mostly affected by micro terrain."
1,"In this study we review recent studies where dicyandiamide was used as a nitrification inhibitor to reduce both N2O emissions from urine patches and nitrate leaching from pasture systems, and which led to the development of a commercial product for use on farmland. On average, emissions of N2O and nitrate leaching were reduced by 72% and 61%, respectively. This study then demonstrates how a mitigation tool can be accounted for in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's inventory methodology when constructing an inventory of New Zealand's agricultural soil N2O emissions. The current New Zealand specific emission factors for EF1 (0.01), EF3(PRP) (0.01) and Frac(LEACH) (0.07) are amended to values of 0.0058, 0.0058 and 0.0455. Examples are also given, based on OVERSEER(TM) of the implications of farm management scenarios on N2O inventories and total greenhouse gas production when using a N2O mitigation tool; CO2 equivalents kg(-1) milk solid decreased from 14.2 to as little as 11.7, depending on the management scenario modelled."
0,"Collaboration across sectors, disciplines and countries is a key concept to achieve the overarching One Health (OH) objective for better human, animal and environmental health. Differences in terminology and interpretation of terms are still a significant hurdle for cross-sectoral information exchange and collaboration within the area of OH including One Health Surveillance (OHS). The development of the here described glossary is a collaborative effort of three projects funded within the One Health European Joint Programme (OHEJP). We describe the infrastructure of the OHEJP Glossary, as well as the methodology to create such a cross-sectoral web resource in a collaborative manner. The new OHEJP Glossary allows OH actors to identify terms with different or shared interpretation across sectors. Being aware of such differences in terminology will help overcome communication hurdles in the future and consequently support collaboration and a more inclusive development of OHS. The OHEJP Glossary was implemented as a web-based, user-friendly and searchable infrastructure that complies with the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable (FAIR) data principles. Maintenance, enrichment and quality control of the OHEJP Glossary is supported through a flexible and updatable curation infrastructure. This increases the uptake potential and exploitation of the OHEJP Glossary by other OH initiatives or tools and services."
1,"There is considerable scientific interest as to how terrestrial biodiversity in Antarctica might respond, or be expected to respond, to climate change. The two species of vascular plant confined to the Antarctic Peninsula have shown clear gains in density and range extension. However, little information exists for the dominant components of the flora, lichens and bryophytes. One approach has been to look at change in biodiversity using altitude as a proxy for temperature change and previous results for Livingston Island suggested that temperature was the controlling factor. We have extended this study at the same site by using chlorophyll fluorometers to monitor activity and microclimate of the lichen, Usnea aurantiaco-atra, and the moss, Hymenoloma crispulum. We confirmed the same lapse rate in temperature but show that changes in water relations with altitude is probably the main driver. There were differences in water source with U. aurantiaco-atra benefitting from water droplet harvesting and the species performed substantially better at the summit. In contrast, activity duration, chlorophyll fluorescence and photosynthetic modelling all show desiccation to have a large negative impact on the species at the lowest site. We conclude that water relations are the main drivers of biodiversity change along the altitudinal gradient with nutrients, not measured here, as another possible contributor."

1,"The outlook and future water resources management of the South Saskatchewan River Basin (SSRB) in Alberta, Canada, under the potential combined impact of climate change and El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), has been assessed using the water resources management model (WRMM) of Alberta Environment and Parks. The potential combined impact of climate change on the SSRB water management is simulated by WRMM on the basis of the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) climate scenarios of the 2040-2069 (2050s) projected by general circulation models of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), together with an active El Nino or La Nina. From results obtained for this study, license holders of the SSRB categorized under district irrigation, junior and future private irrigation, and senior, junior, and future nonirrigation consumptive user groups could be either more or less affected, depending on whether the active climate anomaly will be El Nino or La Nina, than by the impact of climate change alone."
1,"Global anthropogenic environmental degradations such as climate change are increasingly recognized as critical public health issues, on which human beings should urgently act in order to preserve sustainable conditions of living on Earth. Planetary Health is a breakthrough concept and emerging research field based on the recognition of the interdependent relationships between living organisms-both human and non-human-and their ecosystems. In that regards, there have been numerous calls by healthcare professionals for a greater recognition and adoption of Planetary Health perspective. At the same time, current Western healthcare systems are facing their limits when it comes to providing affordable, equitable and sustainable healthcare services. Furthermore, while hospital-centrism remains the dominant model of Western health systems, primary care and public health continue to be largely undervalued by policy makers. While healthcare services will have to adapt to the sanitary impacts of environmental degradations, they should also ambition to accompany and accelerate the societal transformations required to re-inscribe the functioning of human societies within planetary boundaries. The entire health system requires profound transformations to achieve this, with obviously a key role for public health. But we argue that the first line of care represented by primary care might also have an important role to play, with its holistic, interdisciplinary, and longitudinal approach to patients, strongly grounded in their living environments and communities. This will require however to redefine the roles, activities and organization of primary care actors to better integrate socio-environmental determinants of health, strengthen interprofessional collaborations, including non-medical collaborations and more generally develop new, environmentally-centered models of care. Furthermore, a planetary health perspective translated in primary care will require the strengthening of synergies between institutions and actors in the field of health and sustainability."
1,"Mangroves inhabit highly productive inter-tidal ecosystems in >120 countries in the tropics and subtropics providing critical goods and services to coastal communities and contributing to global climate change mitigation owing to substantial carbon stocks. Despite their importance, global mangrove distribution continues to decline primarily due to anthropogenic drivers which vary by region/country. South Asia, Southeast Asia and Asia-Pacific contain approximately 46% of the world's mangrove ecosystems, including the most biodiverse mangrove forests. This region also exhibits the highest global rates of mangrove loss. Remotely sensed data provides timely and accurate information on mangrove distribution and dynamics critical for targeting loss hotspots and guiding intervention. This report inventories, describes and compares all known single- and multi-date remotely sensed datasets with regional coverage and provides areal mangrove extents by country. Multi-date datasets were used to estimate dynamics and identify loss hotspots (i.e., countries that exhibit greatest proportional loss). Results indicate Myanmar is the primary mangrove loss hotspot, exhibiting 35% loss from 1975-2005 and 28% between 2000-2014. Rates of loss in Myanmar were four times the global average from 2000-2012. The Philippines is additionally identified as a loss hotspot, with secondary hotspots including Malaysia, Cambodia and Indonesia. This information helps inform and guide mangrove conservation, restoration and managed-use within the region."
1,"The demand for water is constantly increasing, while there are factors related to climate change and pollution that make it less and less available. Addressing this problem means being able to face it with a global approach, which takes into account that human beings need water to survive, as well as all the systems on which they rely, namely sanitation, health, education, business, and industry. While human behavior is influenced by the growing awareness on this topic promoted by organizations specifically targeting this mission, the need to protect water resources in operational terms has led mainly to the need for smart urban infrastructure planning, consistent with the objective of promoting sustainable development. To this aim, the authorities in charge of monitoring the implementation of the investment plans by operators need to perform accurate evaluations of the technical quality of the services provided. The present paper introduces a framework to design a Multi-criteria Spatial Decision Support System, conceived to help decision-makers define and analyze the investment priorities of the individual service operators. By building a knowledge model of the network under investigation, decision-makers are aware of physical components of the whole system and are provided with an intervention priority index related to the network objects that could be affected by the planning action to be implemented."
1,"Many coastal countries are concerned with sustainable energy generation to meet their current and future energy needs. Tidal energy is an attractive resource as in-stream turbines can generate electricity even at moderate flow velocities. However, not all coastal areas are equally well-suited for tidal energy development. The survey of potential locations and their power densities is a crucial step in evaluating the potential cost-benefit of tidal energy. This research surveys the intensity and distribution of offshore tidal energy along whole coastline of China based on a high-resolution numerical simulation with a minimum mesh spacing of 80 m. The Finite Volume Community Ocean Model (FVCOM) has been used to carry out the numerical simulation work. Since FVCOM uses an unstructured mesh, it can accurately identify complex coastlines, such as those along islands, waterways, and estuaries. The simulation period for this numerical survey is 30 days. The accuracy of the simulation results is validated using 8-days in-situ measurements obtained at 17 coastal stations in the region of study. Research results indicate that the total mean tidal energy is 1.19 x 1014 J along the coastline of China. The tidal energy is mainly distributed in the south and southeast of the coastline of China. This study also identifies 45, 23 and 9 top sites, where the averaged tidal energy density is greater than 500, 1000, and 1500 W/m2, respectively, suitable for tidal energy extraction and utilization. Considering the long development cycle of tidal energy and global climate change, this study also investigates the impact of sea-level rise (SLR) on tidal energy distribution in the region of study using a 50-year (0.5 m) and 100-year (1.0 m) SLR scenarios. It is found that the total mean tidal energy increases by 3.0% and 6.5% for 50-year and 100-year SLR scenarios, respectively. It is believed that the findings drawn from this study could be instructive for future utilization of tidal energy along the coastline of China."
1,"By-products of agricultural and forestry processes, known as residues, may act as a primary source of renewable energy. Studies assessing the availability of this resource offer little insight on the drivers and constraints of the available potential as well as the associated costs and how these may vary across scenarios. This study projects long-term global supply curves of the available potential using consistent scenarios of agriculture and forestry production, livestock production and fuel use from the spatially explicit integrated assessment model IMAGE. In the projections, residue production is related to agricultural and forestry production and intensification, and the limiting effect of ecological and alternative uses of residues are accounted for. Depending on the scenario, theoretical potential is projected to increase from approximately 120EJyr(-1) today to 140-170EJyr(-1) by 2100, coming mostly from agricultural production. To maintain ecological functions approximately 40% is required to remain in the field, and a further 20-30% is diverted towards alternative uses. Of the remaining potential (approximately 50EJyr(-1) in 2100), more than 90% is available at costs <10$(2005)GJ(-1). Crop yield improvements increase residue productivity, albeit at a lower rate. The consequent decrease in agricultural land results in a lower requirement of residues for erosion control. The theoretical potential is most sensitive to baseline projections of agriculture and forestry demand; however, this does not necessarily affect the available potential which is relatively constant across scenarios. The most important limiting factors are the alternative uses. Asia and North America account for two-thirds of the available potential due to the production of crops with high residue yields and socioeconomic conditions which limit alternative uses."
1,"Assessing the vulnerability of broadly described food systems to global environmental change requires a new, synthetic approach. Food systems can best be conceptualized as the integration of humans and the environment or coupled social-ecological systems. However, much of the existing literature on vulnerability assessment focuses on either social or ecological systems, and conceptual gaps limit the holistic evaluation of linked systems in which both social and ecosystem outcomes are important. I suggest an approach with which to integrate factors across a food system to assess the system's vulnerability to environmental change by focusing on key processes and system characteristics. However, the multiple objectives of different actors in food systems make tradeoffs inevitable and complicate the evaluation of vulnerability. Further development and use of this approach is a promising avenue for future research because empirical evidence is needed to further elaborate these understandings."

Study focus: The growing demand for food, water, and energy led Mali and Guinea to develop ambitious hydropower and irrigation plans, including the construction of a new dam and the extension of irrigation schemes. These two developments will take place upstream of sensible ecosystem hotspots while the feasibility of development plans in terms of water availability and sustainability is questionable. Where agricultural development in past decades focused mainly on intensifying dry-season crops cultivation, future plans include extension in both the dry and wet seasons. New hydrological insights for the region: Today's irrigation demand corresponds to 7% of the average annual Niger discharge and could account to one third in 2045. An extension of irrigated agriculture is possible in the wet season, while extending dry-season cropping would be largely compromised with the one major existing Selingue dam. An additional large Fomi or Moussako dam would not completely satisfy dry-season irrigation demands in the 2045 scenario but would reduce the estimated supply gap from 36% to 14%. However, discharge peaks may decrease by 40% reducing the inundated area in the Inner Niger Delta by 21%, while average annual discharge decreases by 30%. Sustainable development should therefore consider investments in water-saving irrigation and management practices to enhance the feasibility of the envisaged irrigation plans instead of completely relying on the construction of a flow regime altering dam."
1,"Global change effects have favoured the introduction of new species in marine ecosystems in recent years. Gracilaria vermiculophylla, a red seaweed native from the north-eastern Pacific, has successfully colonised large regions in the Northern Hemisphere. In this research, we implemented species distribution models (SDMs) to (i) examine which were the most important environmental factors defining the presence of G. vermiculophylla at a global scale, and (ii) determine the potential current and future distribution of G. vermiculophylla based on two climate scenarios (representative concentration pathways (RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5)). Our results suggest that temperature and salinity were the most important variables explaining the distribution of the target species. Additionally, the SDMs for present climate settings showed a potential wider distribution than is recorded to date. In addition, a subtle habitat expansion of 2.9 degrees into higher latitudes was reported under the RCP 2.6 scenario by the end of this century. The high-carbon-emission scenario (RCP 8.5) delivered a potential large habitat expansion (6.0 degrees), even reaching arctic latitudes, and a remarkable habitat loss of 11 degrees in its southern distribution range. SMDs also forecasted suitable areas for this species in the Southern Hemisphere, pointing toward a potential global expansion in the coming decades."
1,"The global energy requirement has grown at a phenomenonal rate and the consumption of primary energy sources has had a very high positive growth. This article focuses on the consumption of different primary energy sources and identifies that coal will continue to remain as the primary energy in the foreseeable future. It examines the energy requirement perspective for India and demand of coal as the primary energy source. Economic development and poverty alleviation depend on securing affordable energy sources and the Indian coal mining industry offers a bright future for the country's energy security, provided the industry is allowed to develop by supportive government policies and adopts the latest technologies for mining. It is ironic that in spite of having plentiful reserves, India is not able to increase coal production to meet its current and future demand. The strategies to be adopted for growth and meeting the coal demand are discussed. But such energy is very much concerned with environmental degradation and must be driven by contemporary managerial acumen addressing environmental and social challenges effectively. The article highlights the emissions of greenhouse gases due to burning of fossil fuels and environmental consequences of global warming and sea-level rise. Environmental laws for the abatement of environmental degradation are discussed in this article."
1,"We examined the effects of fire recurrence on a mosaic structure of Quercus suber and Erica-Cistus shrubland communities of Southeastern France in order to improve the understanding of fire-vegetation interplay. Plant communities that were similar in 1959 (woodlands on shrublands called maquis on acidic soils) were compared along a gradient of fire recurrence, from 0 to 4 fires, with different time intervals between fires. The results showed that understory cover increased roughly with fire recurrence, whereas tree height, cover, density, stand basal area and litter depth decreased. Different fire recurrences along the past decades led to different vegetation types. High fire recurrence corresponded to maquis and sparse cork-oak woodlands while pure oak woodlands established in the absence of fire during the same period. In all, the diversity of tree diameter decreased with fire recurrence. High fire recurrence (3 or 4 fires in 50 years) led to a simple vertical structure of vegetation with a mono-layered shrub cover and few Quercus suber trees. In contrast, spatial connections between plants were maximal at longer time intervals, leading to a multi-layered vegetation. We finally discuss the potential implications of past fires on the behavior of future fires in the perspective of a sustainable management of these Mediterranean ecosystems. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

1,"The frequency and severity of global drought-induced impacts have led to raising awareness of the need for improved river management. Although academic publications on drought have proliferated, a systematic review of literature has not yet been conducted to identify trends, themes, key topics, and authorships. This study aims to evaluate the scientific evidence for the hydrological drought characteristics and the methodologies by performing as a framework. This systematic review performed three-stage screening of literature review for current applicable hydrological drought studies that have been conducted since the year of 2000 concerning methodologies, literature research gaps, and trends, and contribute to future studies. The analysis shows the increasing trends of research and publications in the hydrological drought assessment. The primary research themes are hydrological drought is drought severity, drought vulnerability, and drought forecast. Despite the current research findings, spatial and temporal variability, low flow analysis and regional modelling are the most important to encourage a holistic approach and international collaborations. The finding identified the shortcomings of most research, which are the use of non-standardized methodological and distinct sample sizes, resulting in data summary challenges and unrealistic comparisons."
0,"The ability of plants to disperse seeds may be critical for their survival under the current constraints of landscape fragmentation and climate change. Seed dispersal distance would therefore be an important variable to include in species distribution models. Unfortunately, data on dispersal distances are scarce, and seed dispersal models only exist for some species with particular dispersal modes. To overcome this lack of knowledge, we propose a simple approach to estimate seed dispersal. distances for a whole regional flora. We reviewed literature about seed dispersal in temperate regions and compiled data for dispersal distances together with information about the dispersal mode and plant traits. Based on this information, we identified seven dispersal types with similar dispersal distances. For each type, upper limits for the distance within which 50% and 99% of a species' seeds will disperse were estimated with the 80(th) percentile of the available values. These distances varied 5000-fold among the seven dispersal types, but generally less than 50-fold within the types. Thus, our dispersal types represented a large part of the variation in observed dispersal distances. The attribution of a dispersal type to a particular species only requires information that is already available in databases for most Central European species, i.e. dispersal vector (e.g. wind, animals), the precise mode of dispersal (e.g. dyszoochory, epizoochory), and species traits influencing the efficiency of dispersal (e.g. plant height, typical habitats). This typology could be extended to other regions and will make it possible to include seed dispersal in species distribution models."
1,"A new stage-structured model for the population dynamics of the mosquito (a major vector for numerous vector-borne diseases), which takes the form of a deterministic system of non-autonomous nonlinear differential equations, is designed and used to study the effect of variability in temperature and rainfall on mosquito abundance in a community. Two functional forms of eggs oviposition rate, namely the Verhulst-Pearl logistic and Maynard-Smith-Slatkin functions, are used. Rigorous analysis of the autonomous version of the model shows that, for any of the oviposition functions considered, the trivial equilibrium of the model is locally- and globally-asymptotically stable if a certain vectorial threshold quantity is less than unity. Conditions for the existence and global asymptotic stability of the non-trivial equilibrium solutions of the model are also derived. The model is shown to undergo a Hopf bifurcation under certain conditions (and that increased density-dependent competition in larval mortality reduces the likelihood of such bifurcation). The analyses reveal that the Maynard-Smith-Slatkin oviposition function sustains more oscillations than the Verhulst-Pearl logistic function (hence, it is more suited, from ecological viewpoint, for modeling the egg oviposition process). The non-autonomous model is shown to have a globally-asymptotically stable trivial periodic solution, for each of the oviposition functions, when the associated reproduction threshold is less than unity. Furthermore, this model, in the absence of density-dependent mortality rate for larvae, has a unique and globally-asymptotically stable periodic solution under certain conditions. Numerical simulations of the non-autonomous model, using mosquito surveillance and weather data from the Peel region of Ontario, Canada, show a peak mosquito abundance for temperature and rainfall values in the range C and [15-35] mm, respectively. These ranges are recorded in the Peel region between July and August (hence, this study suggests that anti-mosquito control effects should be intensified during this period)."
0,"Understanding how people view flash flood risks can help improve risk communication, ultimately improving outcomes. This article analyzes data from 26 mental models interviews about flash floods with members of the public in Boulder, Colorado, to understand their perspectives on flash flood risks and mitigation. The analysis includes a comparison between public and professional perspectives by referencing a companion mental models study of Boulder-area professionals. A mental models approach can help to diagnose what people already know about flash flood risks and responses, as well as any critical gaps in their knowledge that might be addressed through improved risk communication. A few public interviewees mentioned most of the key concepts discussed by professionals as important for flash flood warning decision making. However, most interviewees exhibited some incomplete understandings and misconceptions about aspects of flash flood development and exposure, effects, or mitigation that may lead to ineffective warning decisions when a flash flood threatens. These include important misunderstandings about the rapid evolution of flash floods, the speed of water in flash floods, the locations and times that pose the greatest flash flood risk in Boulder, the value of situational awareness and environmental cues, and the most appropriate responses when a flash flood threatens. The findings point to recommendations for ways to improve risk communication, over the long term and when an event threatens, to help people quickly recognize and understand threats, obtain needed information, and make informed decisions in complex, rapidly evolving extreme weather events such as flash floods."
0,"Landscapes are continually changing due to numerous assaults, including habitat alteration, anthropogenic disturbances, and climate change. Understanding how species will respond to these changes is of critical importance for conservation and management. Mechanistic models, such as biophysical models (BPMs), are an increasingly popular tool to predict how local population dynamics or species' distributions may be altered in response to environmental and climate changes. By mechanistically modeling relationships between environmental conditions, physiology and behavior, it is possible to make accurate predictions about how species may respond. However, BPMs are often difficult to implement due to lack of appropriate, species-specific data that is biologically realistic or relevant. In this study, we present a BPM for the salamander Plethodon jordani and assess how adding more biological realism has potential to alter model predictions about annual energy budgets. Additionally, we conducted local and global sensitivity analyses to evaluate the importance of accurately specifying model parameter values and functional relationships. We found that the addition of biological realism resulted in greater model complexity as well as substantially different estimates of energy balance. Correct parameterization of biophysical models is also critical, as small changes in parameter values can result in disproportionately large changes in downstream model estimates. Our model highlights the overall importance of using ecologically relevant and specific data for input parameters, as well as careful assessment of parameter sensitivity. We encourage researchers to be aware of the data they are using to parameterize BPMs, and urge the collection of system-specific data that is relevant in spatial and temporal scale. We also recommend greater and more transparent use of sensitivity analyses to provide a better understanding of the model, as well as greater confidence in model predictions."
1,"Coral reef ecosystems are among the most biologically diverse ecosystems on the planet. In addition to their value in terms of biodiversity, coral reefs provide food and resources for over 500 million people. Despite their importance, coral reefs are declining at a rapid rate (1-2% per year) as a result of a range of local (e.g., overexploitation of fisheries, declining water quality) and global (e.g., global warming and ocean acidification) drivers. Extensive experimental and field evidence suggests that atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations of 450 ppm will lead to the loss of coral-dominated reef systems, with the prospect that dangerous levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide for coral reefs were exceeded in 1979 when mass coral bleaching was reported for the first time. The exact response of coral reefs remains uncertain although it is highly unlikely that coral-dominated reef systems will be present in future oceans at the current rate of warming and acidification of the world's tropical oceans. The loss of these important coastal ecosystems will diminish the resources available to hundreds of millions of people along tropical coastlines. Understanding the impacts on people and industry is an imperative if we are to devise effective systems by which tropical coastal communities are to adapt to rapidly changing tropical coastal environments. Our current understanding of these important issues, however, is in a relatively undeveloped state and must be a priority of future research."
1,"Temperate forests and grasslands carry key ecosystem functions and provide essential services. Remote-sensing derived greenness has been widely used to assess the response of ecosystem function to climate and land-cover changes. Although reforestation and grassland restoration have been proposed to enhance the regional greenness in Northern China, the independent contribution of climate without the interference of land-cover change at meso and large scales has rarely been explored. To separate the impacts of climate change on vegetation greenness from those of land-cover/use change, we identified large patches of forests and grasslands in Northern China without land-cover/use changes in 2001-2015 and derived their greenness using MODIS enhanced vegetation index (EVI). We found that most deciduous-broadleaved forest patches showed greening, and the significant slope of the annual mean and maximum EVI are 3.97 +/- 0.062 x 10(-3)and 4.8 +/- 0.116 x 10(-3)yr(-1), respectively. On the contrary, grassland patches showed great spatial heterogeneity and only those in the east showed greening. The partial correlation analysis between EVI and climate showed that the greening of grassland patches is primarily supported by the increased growing-season precipitation with mean significant coefficient of 0.72 +/- 0.01. While wet-year (0.57 +/- 0.01) and nongrowing-season precipitation (0.68 +/- 0.01) significantly benefit greening of deciduous-broadleaved forests, the altered temperature seasonality modulates their greening spatial-heterogeneously. The increased growing-season minimum temperature might lengthen the growing season and contribute to the greening for the temperature-limited north as shown by positive partial correlation coefficient of 0.66 +/- 0.01, but might elevate respiration and reduce greening of the forests in the south as shown by negative coefficient of -0.70 +/- 0.01. Daytime warming in growing season is found to favor the drought-tolerant oak dominated forest in the south due to enhanced photosynthesis, but may not favor the forests dominated by less-drought-tolerant birch in the north due to potential water stress. Therefore, grassland greening was essentially promoted by the growing-season precipitation, however, in addition to being driven by precipitation, greening of deciduous forests was regulated spatial-heterogeneously by asymmetrical diurnal and seasonal warming which could be attributed to species composition."
1,"A community-based monitoring (CBM) approach creates a working relationship between scientists, resource managers and local communities to address natural resource problems. This study analyses CBM data from Ankasa Conservation Area (ACA), Ghana, and assesses how such a CBM model fits into the national Measurement, Reporting and Verification (MRV) system for REDD+. Satellite imagery was used to generate land cover change maps for the different land use categories in ACA. A checklist of deforestation and forest degradation-related activities was designed with inputs from study communities. Nominated community members were trained to collect the data. The land use categories identified in the study area include closed forest, open forest, farmland, bare area, and grassland. The remote sensing data revealed significant land use and land cover changes in the periphery of ACA between 1990 and 2014. Closed forest and open forest areas recorded 28.6% and 35.0% reductions respectively. Data from the CBM showed that cash crop farms and plantations (rubber and coconut) account for the sharp increase (479.9%) in farmlands. The predominant sighting of rodents by community monitors reinforced the deforestation and forest degradation findings in the ACA periphery. A participatory MRV system is essential for the success of REDD+ interventions. With little training, local people can collect forest condition data that are of interest to REDD+ implementation and international policies related to climate change."
1,"The increased frequency of extreme events facing society is placing mounting pressure on cities and regions that need more robust resilience planning against growing uncertainty. Data augmented participatory methods, such as geodesign, offer much promise in supporting strategic planning to make our cities and regions more resilient. In that context, this study aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of geodesign practices in resilience planning, through a systematic review of the selected 487 studies available from various bibliographic databases. The results indicate that a total of 75 studies were connected to resilience thinking, with a focus on climate change, floods, and sea level rise risks. A significant cluster of those resilience-related studies worked, especially, on improving sustainability. A detailed analysis of 59 relevant geodesign case studies revealed a strong underlying emphasis on disaster risk reduction and management activities. This study also noticed two prominent approaches among the analysed case studies to future city scenario planning: computational (41 studies), and collaborative (18 studies). It is recommended that an explicit integration of these two approaches into the geodesign approach can assist future city resilience planning endeavours. Thus, future research should further investigate the utility of integrating data-driven modelling and simulation within a collaborative scenario planning process, the usability of digital tools such as planning support systems within a collaborative geodesign framework, and the value of the plan's performance evaluation during resilience decision-making. Another area for future work is increased community engagement in city resilience practices. The geodesign approach can provide a comprehensive framework for bringing communities, decision-makers, experts, and technologists together to help plan for more resilient city futures. Finally, while geodesign's explicit role in empirical resilience implementations has been found to be low in this systematic review study, there are significant opportunities to support evidence-based and collaborative city resilience planning and decision-making activities."
0,"Key needs for the creation of a nature reserve system are outlined: formulating goals, selecting management categories, taking inventory, identifying gaps, designing reserves, measuring reserve condition and vulnerability, and recognizing the relationship between research and management. Some essential components are highlighted: a regional perspective, diversification of management categories, focus on the economics of human welfare, not ignoring the opportunities small reserves can provide for some biota, addition of marine reserves, and the importance of a focus on natural processes. The view some Americans have of indigenous people and protected areas is not compatible with third world realities. Since the problems and challenges of protecting areas in northern and southern countries are alike in many ways, however, a Eurocentric seeking to articulate the special circumstances faced by tropical countries offers these suggestions.

1,"1. Invertebrates inhabiting marine and freshwater ecosystems make important contributions to global biodiversity and provide significant services that have cascading effects across ecosystems. However, this group is grossly under-represented in assessments of conservation status and often neglected in targeted aquatic conservation efforts. 2. In global assessments of 7857 freshwater invertebrates and 2864 marine invertebrates, 30-34% were considered Data Deficient highlighting the paucity of information for making such assessments. Of the invertebrate groups that could be assessed, those with poor dispersal abilities and high local endemism, such as many gastropods, crayfish and mussels, are the most threatened. 3. Springs and subterranean hydrological systems support the highest proportions of threatened freshwater species, while in marine environments coral reefs, lagoons and anchialine systems are particularly vulnerable. 4. Key agents of biodiversity decline in aquatic ecosystems are water pollution, overexploitation and harvesting, habitat degradation and destruction, alien invasive species, and climate change. Effects of dams and water management along with pollution from urban, agricultural and forestry sources are the main threats in freshwater ecosystems, whereas a broad range of factors have impacts on marine invertebrates, including biological resource use. 5. Significant impediments facing conservation of aquatic invertebrates are limited knowledge of their diversity, the need for broadscale actions to account for connectivity within and across ecosystems, lack of political will and investment, and the prospect that conditions may get worse before they improve, possibly not in time to save some already highly imperilled invertebrate species from extinction.

1,"Climate change causes the global redistribution of precipitation, yet little is known about the effects of the changes in precipitation intensity and frequency on the seedlings of wood trees in warm temperate forests. In this study, we focused on the effects of variability in both the intensity and frequency of water supply on the physiological traits, biomass, and growth of an important plantation wood species, Robinia pseudoacacia. In the greenhouse, we exposed R. pseudoacacia seedlings to three rainfall intensity and three rainfall frequency treatments. The results from the 62-day experiment revealed that lower rainfall intensity and frequency significantly reduced the photosynthetic performance, growth, and biomass of the tree seedlings. In lower rainfall intensity and frequency conditions, the seedlings had improved water absorption and utilization by increasing the water use efficiency and root shoot ratio, and reduced water consumption by defoliating the compound leaves of the lower crown. More importantly, we found that R. pseudoacacia seedlings were more sensitive to rainfall frequency than to rainfall intensity. Therefore, our results suggest that increasing the irrigation water, especially irrigation frequency, could better facilitate the survival and growth of R. pseudoacacia seedlings and eventually promote the process of vegetation restoration in the future global climate change context."
1,"The volcanic island of Grand Comoro, Malagasy biogeographic region, is inhabited by three species of Phelsuma day geckos; two island-endemic taxa (Phelsuma comorensis and Phelsuma v-nigra comoraegrandensis) and the introduced Phelsuma dubia. Phelsuma comorensis is restricted to elevations of greater than 150m above sea level on the northern of the island's two volcanoes and is the only Phelsuma above 300m. The other species are widespread at low elevations but also reach levels above 900m at the southern volcano. To investigate these divergent distribution patterns, we used environmental niche models based on climate and habitat data and tested whether predicted climate change may influence species distributions. Analyses of niche overlap did not show significant differences between present-day and predicted future potential distributions of any Phelsuma species studied, which could be seen as an indicator of resilience towards climate change. Climate models reflected the restricted distribution of P.comorensis with precipitation of the wettest month detected as most important variable, whereas habitat models predicted an island-wide distribution. While climate appears to determine the distribution of P.comorensis, we propose isolation by migration barriers as an alternative and discuss the detection of causal versus spurious relationships in ecological niche models."
1,"Future changes in temperature and precipitation may be exacerbated by climate change, and this could result in extreme hydrologic events like floods and droughts. The objective of this study was to assess how the future climate would affect flooding in Ethiopia's lower Bilate catchment. In order to simulate flood occurrences and maps for various climate scenarios, two hydraulic models-HEC-RAS and a semi-distributed physically based HEC-HMS hydrologic model-were utilized. For the baseline (1971-2000), mid-term (2041-2070), and long-term (2071-2100) cycles under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, the bias-corrected data of five climate models were used. The baseline and future period stream flow data were used to produce the flood events for the 50- and 100-year return floods. Flood inundation area and depth were computed using the HEC-RAS model. The flood risk map of the catchment was developed by combining the flood vulnerability and hazard indexes. Future predictions showed that the catchment's maximum and minimum temperatures and average annual precipitation would rise, which also increase the yearly stream would flow. According to the RCP4.5 and 8.5 scenarios, the intensity of future floods will rise and inundate an area ranging from 88.5 to 161 ha considering the 50 and 100-year flood. The worst case scenario under RCP8.5 is the possible inundation of 161 hectares of the studied reach that could be inundated by a 100-year cycle flood. Climate change will make flooding more difficult in the 2050s and 2080s, yet an extreme and riskier flood may happen in the 2050s under the RCP8.5 scenario. The results of this study could aid non-governmental and governmental organizations in their efforts to better control flood risk in the lower Bilate catchment."
1,"The recent environmental history of Bosten Lake in Xinjiang, in the arid region of continental NW China, was studied using short core sediment samples extracted from the river mouth and the deep centre of the lake. Based on chironomid stratigraphy and sediment properties, it was possible to distinguish two stages during the past century. The concentration of midge head capsules sharply decreased and the entire chironomid community was overwhelmed around the 1950s due to the rapid accumulation of sediment and the sudden increased proportion of fine grains caused by enhanced human activities (mainly population increase and the subsequent reclamation of alkaline land and agriculture intensification). Chironomus plumosus-type and Microchironomus dominated the chironomid fauna starting in the 1950s. Human activities in the catchment together with climate change exerted significant influence on the chironomid fauna, causing the near disappearance of Procladius and an increase in fine sediment. Environmental changes in the Bosten Lake catchment affected the chironomid fauna in the profundal zone much earlier than in the river mouth zone. We present a case study in order to gain a further insight into the ecological effects of climate change and anthropogenic activities on the chironomid fauna in the arid continental region of NW China. This will assist the definition of 'pre-disturbance' conditions of the lakes in this region and provide baseline information for establishing targets for the management and restoration of the lakes in this vast region."
0,"The terrestrial carbon sink accelerated during 1998-2012, concurrently with the slow warming period, but the mechanisms behind this acceleration are unclear. Here we analyse recent changes in the net land carbon sink (NLS) and its driving factors, using atmospheric inversions and terrestrial carbon models. We show that the linear trend of NLS during 1998-2012 is about 0.17 +/- 0.05 Pg C yr(-2), which is three times larger than during 1980-1998 (0.05 +/- 0.05 Pg C yr(-2)). According to terrestrial carbon model simulations, the intensification of the NLS cannot be explained by CO2 fertilization or climate change alone. We therefore use a bookkeeping model to explore the contribution of changes in land-use emissions and find that decreasing land-use emissions are the dominant cause of the intensification of the NLS during the slow warming period. This reduction of land-use emissions is due to both decreased tropical forest area loss and increased afforestation in northern temperate regions. The estimate based on atmospheric inversions shows consistently reduced land-use emissions, whereas another bookkeeping model did not reproduce such changes, probably owing to missing the signal of reduced tropical deforestation. These results highlight the importance of better constraining emissions from land-use change to understand recent trends in land carbon sinks."
1,"Using unique data on conflict-related incidents in the Philippines, we exploit seasonal variation in the relationship between rainfall and agricultural production to learn about the mechanism through which rainfall affects civil conflict. We find that an increase in dry-season rainfall leads to an increase in agricultural production and dampens conflict intensity. By contrast, an increase in wet-season rainfall is harmful to crops and produces more conflict. Consistent with the hypothesis that rebel groups gain strength after a bad harvest, we find that negative rainfall shocks lead to an increase in conflict incidents initiated by insurgents but not by government forces. These results suggest that the predicted shift towards wetter wet seasons and drier dry seasons will lead to more civil conflict even if annual rainfall totals remain stable. We conclude that policies aimed at mitigating the effect of climate change on agriculture could have the added benefit of reducing civil conflict. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
1,"Emerging infectious diseases of wildlife have markedly increased in the last few decades. Unsustainable, continuous, and rapid alterations within and between coupled human and natural systems have significantly disrupted wildlife disease dynamics. Direct and indirect anthropogenic effects, such as climate change, pollution, encroachment, urbanization, travel, and trade, can promote outbreaks of infectious diseases in wildlife. We constructed a coupled human and natural systems framework identifying three main wildlife disease risk factors behind these anthropogenic effects: (i) immune suppression, (ii) viral spillover, and (iii) disease propagation. Through complex and convoluted dynamics, each of the anthropogenic effects and activities listed in our framework can lead, to some extent, to one or more of the identified risk factors accelerating disease outbreaks in wildlife. In this review, we present a novel framework to study anthropogenic effects within coupled human and natural systems that facilitate the emergence of infectious disease involving wildlife. We demonstrate the utility of the framework by applying it to Fibropapillomatosis disease of marine turtles. We aim to articulate the intricate and complex nature of anthropogenically exacerbated wildlife infectious diseases as multifactorial. This paper supports the adoption of a One Health approach and invites the integration of multiple disciplines for the achievement of effective and long-lasting conservation and the mitigation of wildlife emerging diseases."
1,"The landscape surrounding urban areas is often used as farmland. With the observed expansion of urban areas over the last decades and a projected continuation of this trend, our objective was to analyze how urbanization affects food supply and demand in The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. We used a chain of simulation models covering components of the atmosphere (climate simulations), biosphere (crop yield calculations), and anthroposphere (simulations of urban expansion and land-use change) to calculate the effect of farmland displacement on land and water resources (hydrosphere). Our simulations show that the displacement of farmland itself has hardly any effect on cropland demand, crop yields, or irrigation water requirements. These results indicate that Jordan has sufficient productive areas available to buffer effects of urban expansion on food production for the next decades. However, this picture changes dramatically once we include changes in socioeconomy and climate in our simulations. The isolated effect of climate change results in an expected increase in irrigation water requirements of 19 MCM by 2025 and 64 MCM by 2050. It furthermore leads to an increase in cropland area of 147 km(2) by 2025 and 265 km(2) by 2050. While the combined analysis of urban expansion, climate change, and socioeconomic change makes optimistic assumptions on the increase in crop yields by 2050, the results still indicate a pronounced effect on cropland demands (2700 km(2)) and a steep increase in irrigation water requirements (439 MCM). Our simulation results highlight the importance of high resolution, spatially explicit projections of future land changes as well as the importance of spatiotemporal scenario studies at the regional level to help improving water planning strategies.

1,"Geodiversity has been used as a surrogate for biodiversity when species locations are unknown, and this utility can be extended to situations where species locations are in flux. Recently, scientists have designed conservation networks that aim to explicitly represent the range of geophysical environments, identifying a network of physical stages that could sustain biodiversity while allowing for change in species composition in response to climate change. Because there is no standard approach to designing such networks, we compiled 8 case studies illustrating a variety of ways scientists have approached the challenge. These studies show how geodiversity has been partitioned and used to develop site portfolios and connectivity designs; how geodiversity-based portfolios compare with those derived from species and communities; and how the selection and combination of variables influences the results. Collectively, they suggest 4 key steps when using geodiversity to augment traditional biodiversity-based conservation planning: create land units from species-relevant variables combined in an ecologically meaningful way; represent land units in a logical spatial configuration and integrate with species locations when possible; apply selection criteria to individual sites to ensure they are appropriate for conservation; and develop connectivity among sites to maintain movements and processes. With these considerations, conservationists can design more effective site portfolios to ensure the lasting conservation of biodiversity under a changing climate. Estudios de Caso de Planes de Conservacion que Incorporan a la GeodiversidadLa geodiversidad se ha usado como un sustituto de la biodiversidad cuando la ubicacion de las especies es desconocida y esta utilidad puede extenderse a situaciones en las que la ubicacion de las especies esta en cambio constante. Recientemente, los cientificos han disenado redes de conservacion que buscan representar explicitamente la gama de ambientes geofisicos, al identificar una red de estados fisicos que podrian mantener a la biodiversidad mientras permiten cambios en la composicion de las especies en respuesta al cambio climatico. Ya que no existe una estrategia estandar para disenar dichas redes, compilamos ocho estudios de caso que ilustran la variedad de formas con las cuales los cientificos han enfrentado el reto. Estos estudios muestran como se ha dividido la geodiversidad y como se ha usado para desarrollar portafolios de sitios y disenos de conectividad; como los portafolios basados en geodiversidad se comparan con aquellos derivados de las especies y las comunidades: y como la seleccion y la combinacion de variables influye sobre los resultados. Colectivamente, los estudios sugieren cuatro pasos clave al usar la geodiversidad para aumentar la conservacion basada tradicionalmente en la biodiversidad: crear unidades de suelo a partir de las variables relevantes para las especies combinadas de una forma significativa ecologicamente; representar las unidades de suelo en una configuracion espacial logica e integrarlas con la ubicacion de las especies de ser posible; aplicar criterios de seleccion a los sitios individuales para asegurar que son adecuados para la conservacion; y desarrollar la conectividad entre sitios para mantener los movimientos y los procesos. Con estas consideraciones, los conservacionistas pueden disenar portafolios de sitio mas efectivos para asegurar la conservacion duradera de la biodiversidad bajo un clima cambiante. Resumen"
1,"The objective of this research was to analyze the impact of climate change on the behavior of monthly discharges in the Anya basin, a tributary of the Mantaro, Junin, at 2100, with the SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model. Daily gridded data on precipitation and temperatures were obtained from PISCO (Peruvian Interpolated data of the SENAMHI's Climatological and Hydrological Observations) between 1981 and 2015 and average monthly flows measured at the Anya hydrometric station. For the analysis of the space-time effect of climate change on temperature and precipitation and its influence on basin runoff, five global climate models (ACCES1.0, bcc_csm1, BNU_ESM, CMCC_CM and GISS_E2) were used in two emission scenarios (RCP 4.5 and 8.5). The simulation was carried out for the period 2070-2100, considering 1980-2010 as the base period. The model worked satisfactorily with the statistical values of Nash-Sutcliffe (NSE), PBIAS and coefficient of determination (R-2). In the basin, the average results show an increase in precipitation (between 4.63 and 8.14 %) and temperature (from 2.3 to 4.2 degrees C), in RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios by 2100. Likewise, there would be an increase in flows in comparison with the base period, obtaining that, on average, the flow in the basin would increase by 2.4 and 12.6 % in the RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios, respectively. It is concluded that the increase in temperature and precipitation will influence a greater runoff and risk of flooding in the cultivation areas in the basin."
1,"Predicted increases in the frequency and intensity of droughts across the temperate biome have highlighted the need to examine the extent to which forests may differ in their sensitivity to water stress. At present, a rich body of literature exists on how leaf- and stem-level physiology influence tree drought responses; however, less is known regarding the dynamic interactions that occur belowground between roots and soil physical and biological factors. Hence, there is a need to better understand how and why processes occurring belowground influence forest sensitivity to drought. Here, we review what is known about tree species' belowground strategies for dealing with drought, and how physical and biological characteristics of soils interact with rooting strategies to influence forest sensitivity to drought. Then, we highlight how a belowground perspective of drought can be used in models to reduce uncertainty in predicting the ecosystem consequences of droughts in forests. Finally, we describe the challenges and opportunities associated with managing forests under conditions of increasing drought frequency and intensity, and explain how a belowground perspective on drought may facilitate improved forest management.

1,"Cyprus is one of the few areas of the Mediterranean where lower and upper Miocene coral-reefs occur in close proximity and is thus well suited to investigate how environmental and geological changes affected the reefs and their associated shallow-marine facies. The prevailing environmental conditions of the lower Miocene Terra Member and of the upper Miocene Koronia Member are reconstructed here, using detailed microfacies comparisons of the skeletal, foraminiferal and calcareous algal assemblages. The lower Miocene reefs are characterised by a higher biodiversity of coralline algae, large benthic foraminifera and corals, and mainly developed in slightly deeper water (20-40 m, lower euphotic zone) than the upper Miocene reefs (< 15 m; upper euphotic zone). The reduced late Miocene biodiversity was probably caused by changes in the Mediterranean marine environment (e.g. increased seasonality), possibly in response to global cooling, increased latitudinal gradients and progressive isolation of the basin. The observed shift of the reef environment towards the upper euphotic zone could be explained as a response to late Miocene physical oceanographic setting, notably temperature changes, which could have made the upper euphotic zone more favourable for certain hermatypic corals. Similarities between the Miocene carbonate facies of Cyprus and the Eratosthenes Seamount directly to the south, and elsewhere in the Mediterranean region (e.g., Corsica; Italy; Spain), suggest that the environmental changes inferred for the Miocene of Cyprus operated on a Mediterranean or even wider scale."
1,"Extracellular phenol oxidases play an important role in the soil carbon cycle. The effects of a field-scale summer drought manipulation on extracellular litter and soil phenol oxidase activity, soluble phenolic compounds and dissolved organic carbon concentrations were examined for an upland Calluna heathland on a peaty podsol in North Wales. Litter and organic soil phenol oxidase activity was found to be positively correlated with moisture content. Thus in shallow organic soils, which are sensitive to drying during periods of low rainfall, drought may inhibit soil phenol oxidase activity as a result of water limitations. The release of soluble phenolic compounds and DOC from the droughted plots was found to be lowered during the drought period and elevated outside of the drought period. It is hypothesized that these changes may be a result of the reduced ability of extracellular phenol oxidases to process recalcitrant polyphenolic material under drought conditions. A drying incubation carried out with litter and soil cores from the same site suggests that extracellular phenol oxidase activity displays an optimal moisture level. This reconciled the observed water limitation of phenol oxidase activity at the heathland experimental site with previously observed stimulation of phenol oxidase activity by water table drawdown in deeper peats.

1,"From AD 1048 to 1128, Yellow River flooding killed over a million people, left many more homeless and destitute, and turned parts of the once fertile North China Plain into a silted-up agricultural wasteland. Brought on in part by climate change and the Northern Song dynasty's (AD 960-1127) mismanagement of the environment, the Yellow River floods likely hastened the collapse of the Northern Song dynasty. Despite the magnitude of this flood event, no sedimentary deposits have yet been linked to these historically recorded floods. In this research paper, we provide archaeological, sedimentary, and radiocarbon evidence of the AD 1048-1128 Yellow River floods at the Dazhanglongcun, Xidacheng, and Daguxiancun sites in Neihuang County, Henan Province. Based on our data, we argue that the AD 1048-1128 Yellow River floods deposited over 5 m of alluvium on villages in the North China Plain, radically changing both the physical and political landscape of Northern Song dynasty China."
1,"This study compared the environmental burdens of two broiler chicken production systems in Brazil and two in France. One Brazilian system represents large-scale production in the Center-West region of the country; the other is a small-scale production in the South. One of the French systems represents an extensive broiler chicken production system, known as Label Rouge; the other is a standard system. Life-cycle impact assessments were performed using the CML-IA characterization method. The main functional unit adopted was 1 tonne of cooled and packaged chicken, ready for distribution. For the systems and impacts studied, production scale did not affect the environmental impact, but production intensity did. The extensive Label Rouge system had the largest impact among the impact categories studied. This resulted principally from the high feed-conversion ratio of this production system (3.1 kg of feed per kg of live weight) in conjunction with the fact that the feed-production stage contributed most to the overall impact. The contribution of deforestation to the crop-production stage was significant, particularly for climate change, equaling 19% of total emissions of CO(2)eq per tonne of cooled and packaged chicken, in the system of the Center-West of Brazil. The French systems were also affected, since they import crops from Brazil. The system of southern Brazil had less climate change impact because there is no longer deforestation in southern Brazil for crop production. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
1,"This research seeks to understand simulated supercell precipitation characteristics across the conterminous United States (CONUS) using high-resolution, convection-permitting, dynamically downscaled simulations for three 15-year epochs. Epochs include a historical end-of-20th-century period (1990-2005) and two end-of-21st-century (2085-2100) scenarios for intermediate and pessimistic greenhouse gas concentration trajectories. Simulated updraft helicity, which measures the corkscrew flow within a storm's updraft, is used as a proxy for supercells. An algorithm tracks and catalogues updraft helicity swaths that, when buffered, are used to acquire simulated precipitation from supercells. The historical epoch provides a baseline climatology of supercell precipitation for a contemporary climate, which is then compared against the two future epochs to assess how supercell precipitation may change during the 21st century. Despite their relatively small size, supercells provide critical precipitation to the Wheat and Corn Belts, large expanses of CONUS pasture and rangeland, regional aquifers and several large river basins. Many areas in the central CONUS receive upwards of 3%-6% of their annual and 5%-8% of their warm-season precipitation from these storms. Results suggest that precipitation contribution from supercells will decrease in the future across most of the High Plains and Central and Northern Great Plains with robust increases likely across the south-central and Southeast regions. Supercell precipitation rates are expected to increase for large portions of the CONUS by the end-of-the-21st-century, suggesting a growing threat for flash floods from these storms as they become more efficient precipitation producers. This research provides an initial perspective on the magnitude of supercell precipitation and potential changes to this important hydrologic input to assist water-sensitive industries, private and public insurance markets, agriculture entities, as well as inform plans to mitigate and build resilience to rapid environmental and societal change. This research illustrates the precipitation contributions to the United States hydroclimate from rotating thunderstorms known as supercells and how those contributions will change in the 21st century. Results will assist water-sensitive industries, insurance markets and agriculture entities to mitigate and build resilience to rapid environmental and societal changes. image"
1,"Elevated levels of atmospheric CO2 are predicted to contribute to major climatic changes during the next 50-100 years. This can have a significant impact on future food security if such changes make crop plants vulnerable to biotic and abiotic stresses. Indeed, a growing body of recent studies highlighted in this review show that elevated CO2 (eCO(2)) directly and/or indirectly influence plant-biotic interactions. In many instances, eCO(2) alters phytohormone and reactive oxygen signalling, secondary metabolism as well as defence-associated development such as stomatal responses in the host. eCO(2) can also directly and/or indirectly influence pathogenesis-and herbivory-related traits in pest and pathogen populations although currently very little is known about the molecular mechanisms involved in such effects. In addition, eCO(2) alters predator-prey interactions by interfering with indirect defences and chemical communications in insect pests. A better understanding of molecular mechanisms involved in plant-biotic interactions under eCO(2) will be critical towards mitigation of potentially adverse effects of climate change on crop production."
1,"The development of high-density cities has aggravated the harshness of the urban microclimate in face of global warming. However, an adequate urban ventilation system can introduce clean and cool air into high-temperature areas of a city, which can alleviate the urban heat island (UHI) effect and increase residents' thermal comfort. In this study, we devise an integrated air ventilation assessment (IAVA) method to assess the urban wind environment using multi-source data, with Shenzhen as an example. The IAVA map illustrates that developed areas in the south and west of Shenzhen form a wind wall  that reduces wind speeds and prevents wind flow into inland areas. In light of the results of the IAVA, potential ventilation corridors across Shenzhen are then created using the least cost path method. Subsequently, the optimized ventilation corridors are generated via super-imposition over a satellite image and the identification of functioning and compensating areas. Notably, the IAVA introduces the effects of terrain, vegetation, and open space, thus providing a more pragmatic evaluation of the wind environment than frontal area density results. Furthermore, it provides planning guidance for local governments that considers the quality of the urban wind environment in the low-cost and efficient construction of ecological and livable cities."
1,"Riparian ecosystems are recognized as large reservoirs of biodiversity providing important ecosystem services. However, the relationship between tree species diversity and ecosystem functions and the underlying ecological mechanisms have less been studied in riparian corridors. This study assessed the effect of tree diversity (taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic) on riparian ecosystem functions (habitat quality-HbQ and aboveground carbon-AGC) across environmental gradients (distances to stream bed) and conservation status. Data were collected from 96 inventory plots installed in a 1 km buffer zone on either side of permanent streams in the Upper Oueme watershed in northern Benin. We employed linear mixed effects models and structural equation modeling to analyze the data. We found that ecosystem functions (HbQ, AGC) and diversity attributes including species richness (SR), Faith's phylogenetic diversity index (PD) and community-weighted mean of maximum height (CWMHmax) were significantly lower away from the streambed than nearby. The correlation between SR and ecosystem functions was significant and positive across and within the distance gradient and conservation status. We also found that the CWMHmax was the best predictor of both ecosystem functions, and that PD mediated the effect of SR on AGC and HbQ in areas close to the streambed and in unprotected areas, respectively. Our study reveals the influence of human activities on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning relationships in riparian corridors and provides new insights into the importance of tall stature trees and species with distant lineages for the functioning of these ecosystems. Based on the variables measured and tested in this study, we argue that riparian corridor management policies should consider plant traits and phylogeny and promote wider riparian buffers for the co-benefits of biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation."
1,"Stubble return, drainage, and tillage are common practices in rice agriculture, but their integrated effects in the winter season on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (STN) sequestration remain poorly known. A six-year experiment was carried out in a double-rice field to measure CH4 and N2O fluxes and SOC and STN contents, and then the net global warming potential (GWP) and yield-scaled GWP were estimated. Shifting the fields from no management in tradition to tillage in the winter season tended to reduce total CH4 emissions of double-rice seasons by 14.7%, and it significantly decreased the emissions by 28.3% under drainage conditions. An additional reduction of 27.3% was further found without returning stubble. Therefore, winter tillage and drainage substantially reduced total GWP by 28.0%, in particular, a larger decrease (47.2%) was observed by no stubble return though N2O emissions were strongly stimulated by 82.1%. Moreover, winter tillage significantly reduced SOC sequestration rate while played little role in STN sequestration rate. However, winter tillage with stubble return (2.5-4.1 t ha(-1)) under drainage conditions showed the largest SOC (1.58 t C ha(-1) yr(-1)) and STN (0.15 t N ha(-1) yr(-1)) sequestration rates. Therefore, the net GWP and yield-scaled GWP were significantly decreased by 227% and 30.5%, respectively. Overall, our results suggest that winter drainage and tillage with stubble incorporation would be an effective management strategy to promote soil C and N sequestration and mitigate GHG emissions from the double-rice fields."
1,"Station and gridded precipitation data from all over the Indus basin were analyzed for the periods 1951 to 2010 and 1986 to 2010. The non-parametric Mann-Kendall trend test was applied to determine whether statistically significant changes in precipitation amounts occurred overtime, in due consideration of autocorrelation in the data. In addition, linear regression trend lines were fitted to the precipitation series by the method of least squares. We also investigated whether the precipitation in 2010, the year of a devastating flood, was the highest, second highest or third highest recorded annual and monsoonal total in the periods under observation. The use of gridded precipitation data unveiled a spatial pattern of precipitation trends in the Indus River basin. For the shorter time period, we found stronger evidence of positive trends in monsoonal precipitation time series compared to annual precipitation. Significant positive precipitation trends were primarily detected in the mountains: in the northwest (Hindu Kush and Sulaiman Mountains) and in the east (Himalayas) of the Upper Reaches of the Indus River. Negative precipitation trends, most of which are not significant, were detected in the northeast of the Upper Reaches (Karakorum and Transhimalaya) and in the lowlands. Compared to previous years, annual and especially monsoonal precipitation totals in 2010 were extremely high in the Himalayas, the Hindu Kush, the Sulaiman Mountains, and in the central lowlands. Strong monsoon precipitation in the arid high mountainous regions, not used to these amounts of precipitation, played a major role in the 2010 floods in Pakistan. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

1,"Nonlinear increases in warm season temperatures are projected for many regions, a phenomenon we show to be associated with relative surface drying. However, negative human health impacts are physiologically linked to combinations of high temperatures and high humidity. Since the amplified warming and drying are concurrent, the net effect on humid-heat, as measured by the wet bulb temperature (T-W), is uncertain. Wedemonstrate that globally, on the hottest days of the year, the positive effect of amplified warming on T-W is counterbalanced by a larger negative effect resulting from drying. As a result, the largest increases in T(W)and T-x do not occur on the same days. Compared to a world with linear temperature change, the drying associated with nonlinear warming dampens mid-latitude T-W increases by up to 0.5 degrees C, and also dampens the rise in frequency of dangerous humid-heat (T-W. >. 27 degrees C) by up to 5 d per year in parts of North America and Europe. Our results highlight the opposing interactions among temperature and humidity changes and their effects on T-W, and point to the importance of constraining uncertainty in hydrological and warm season humidity changes to best position the management of future humid-heat risks."
1,"1. Weather-related episodic events are typically unpredictable, and their duration is often short. Abiotic and biological responses are often missed in routine monitoring. These responses are, however, now of particular relevance given projected changes in extreme weather conditions. 2. We present data from high-frequency monitoring stations from lakes in Europe, North America and Asia that illustrate two classes of abiotic effects of weather events: (i) generally short-lived effects of storms on lake thermal structure and (ii) the more prolonged effects of high rainfall events on dissolved organic matter levels and water clarity. We further relate these abiotic effects to changes in dissolved oxygen or in chlorophyll a levels. 3. Three differing causes for weather-related decreases in surface dissolved oxygen levels were observed: (i) entrainment of anoxic water from depth, (ii) reduction in primary productivity and (iii) increased mineralisation of organic carbon delivered from the catchment. 4. The duration of in-lake effects tended to be longer for events driven by weather conditions with a longer return period, that is, conditions that were relatively more severe and less frequent at a site. While the susceptibility of lakes to change was related in part to the severity of the meteorological drivers, the impacts also depended on site-specific factors in some cases. 5. The availability of high-frequency data at these sites provided insight into the capacity of the lakes to absorb current and future pressures. Several of the changes we observed, including increases in carbon availability, decreases in photosynthetically active radiation and increased disturbance, have the capacity to shift lakes towards an increased degree of heterotrophy. The magnitude and direction of any such change will, however, also depend on the magnitude and direction of climate change for a given location and on lake and catchment characteristics."
1,"Three years of monthly growth increment data identified large interannual differences in growth rate across six contrasting species in a broadleaved, temperate forest with minimum management intervention (Wytham Woods, UK). Growth rates varied by species and canopy position, and were higher in canopy species. Growth rate in 2010 was up to 40% lower than in 2011 and 2012. This can best be explained as an effect of low temperature, which delayed the start of spring and the growing season. This had a greater impact on the growth of sub-canopy trees than that of canopy species. In temperate systems, late spring and summer is an important component of the whole growing season carbon balance because of long day length. In 2010 there were also periods of lower-than-average rainfall, which may additionally have constrained growth during the growing season. Fluctuations and seasonal changes in both temperature and rainfall are projected to continue, so we may expect to see increasing differences in growth and growth rates. A small effect of location relative to the nearest edge was also detected, with higher growth rates only found >50 m from the forest edge. The findings have implications for forest structure and productivity under climate change, and may thus inform current and future forest management. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
1,"Human activities can considerably change water resources of river basins. This is particularly true in Laohahe River Basin (LRB) located in upper Xiliaohe River in northern China, where intensive irrigation has resulted in almost full cessation of the water inflow, as well as the drastic drop in underground water level. The impact induced by climate change effects and human activities on stream flow changes in LRB was weighed up and distinguished by using Soil and Water Assessment Tool. Simulation of temporal water budgets shows a significant impact of human activities on stream flow reduction. The observed differences in stream flow are largely attributed to human activities. The biggest negative contribution induced by humans is during the period of 1990-2000, the least is during the period of 1968-1979. The negative contribution due to human accounts for 72.99% of the total for 1980-1989, the biggest among three periods. The lower streams of the watershed, with much human induced, experience a relative greater stream flow reduction than the upper."
1,"Mountain glacier shrinkage represents a major effect of the current global warming and 80-100% of the Alpine glaciers are predicted to vanish within the next few decades. As the thawing rate of mountain permafrost ice is much lower than for glacier ice, a shift fromglacial to periglacial dynamics is predicted for Alpine landscapes during the 21st century. Despite the growing literature on the impacts of deglaciation on Alpine hydrology and ecosystems, chemical and biological features of waters emerging from Alpine rock glaciers (i.e. permafrost landforms composed by a mixture of ice and debris) have been poorly investigated so far, and knowledge on microbial bio-diversity of headwaters is still sparse. A set of glacier-, rock glacier- and groundwater/precipitation-fed streams was investigated in the Italian Central Alps in late summer 2016, aiming at exploring bacterial community composition and diversity in epilithic and surface sediment biofilm and at verifying the hypothesis that rock glacier-fed headwaters represent peculiar ecosystems from both a chemical and biological point of view. Rock glacier-fed waters showed high values of electrical conductivity and trace elements related to their bedrock lithology, and their highly diverse bacterial assemblages significantly differed from those detected in glacier-fed streams. Bacterial taxonomic composition appeared to be mainly related to water and substrate type, as well as to water chemistry, the latter including concentrations of nutrients and trace metals. The results of this study confirm the chemical and biological peculiarity of rock glacier-fed waters compared to glacial waters, and suggest a potential driving role of thawing permafrost in modulating future ecological traits of Alpine headwaters within the context of progressing deglaciation.

1,"Dealing with two major challenges, climate change mitigation and biodiversity loss, under the same management program, is more noteworthy than addressing these two separately. Homegardens, a sustainable agroforestry system and a home of diverse species, can be a possible choice to address these two issues. In this study, we assessed tree coverage, and the direct and indirect effects of tree diversity on carbon storage in different carbon pools through stand structure in homegardens of southwestern Bangladesh, using Sentinel 2 and field inventory data from 40 homesteads in eight villages. An unsupervised classification method was followed to assess homegardens' tree coverage. We found a high tree coverage (24.34% of total area of Dighalia) in homesteads, with a high overall accuracy of 96.52%. The biomass and soil organic carbon (p < 0.05) varied significantly among the eight villages, while total carbon stock did not vary significantly (p > 0.05). Shannon diversity had both direct and indirect effects on biomass carbon, upper layer soil organic carbon and total carbon storage, while basal area mediated the indirect effect. Both basal area and tree height had positive effects on biomass carbon and total carbon storage, with basal area having the strongest effect. These findings suggest that we must maintain higher diversity and tree height in order to maximize and sustain carbon storage, where tree diversity increases stand basal area and improves total carbon storage (including soil organic) in homegardens. Therefore, privately managed homegardens could be a potential nature-based solution for biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation in Bangladesh."
1,"Geomorphological and biological archives of relative sea-level change in the western North Atlantic-Caribbean region following the Last Glacial Maximum have traditionally supported the hypothesis of a punctuated rise towards the present sea level. Such records, however, are often at insufficient resolution to discern centennial-scale changes. In caves where the water table is closely controlled by sea level, active periods of speleothem growth constraining maximum sea level, used in combination with marine overgrowths constraining minimum sea level, are a promising alternative archive recording sea-level variability at higher resolution. Here, we present a U-Th-dated early-middle Holocene speleothem record from a submerged cave on the tectonically stable Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. Our record shows that polychaetes (Annelida, Polychaeta) colonised a sub-aerially deposited stalagmite during four individual submergence events. Submergence events occurred at approximately 8.9, 8.6, 8.4 and 6.0ka, which we attribute to previously unrecognised minor sea-level oscillation events (OE1-OE4) above and below -6.12 +/- 0.1m relative to present sea level (r.s.l.). Combining these results with mangrove-derived relative sea-level constraints from another submerged cave on the Yucatan Peninsula, we are able to suggest that OE1 and OE2 did not reach as high as -5.26m r.s.l., but that OE3 and OE4 exceeded -5.22m r.s.l. We conclude that subsidence of the North American ice-load bulge was the main cause of relative sea-level rise. Superimposed on the glacio-isostatic adjustment were periods of widespread northern hemisphere cooling and ice margin re-advance, resulting in a relative sea-level fall on four occasions during the early-middle Holocene."
1,"The Zagros Mountains are one of the key water sources for Iran and recession of the snow line would have an impact on regional water resources. In this study, we used Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro radiometer (MODIS) data obtained from 2000 to 2016 to investigate the upward retreat of the Temporary Snow Line Elevation (TSLE) for the months with the greatest snowfall and highest snow lines (December, January, and February) in the Oshtorankooh region. In addition, to gain a better insight into the impact of recent climate change on the snow cover in Oshtorankooh and its TSLE variations, the Mann-Kendall and TSA non-parametric tests were used for the time period 2000-2016. The results showed an upward retreat of the TSLE. The ground surface temperature observations analyzed using the MODIS data show a temperature increase of 0.52-0.99 degrees C (Aqua MODIS) and 0.82-1.12 degrees C (Terra MODIS) in the same time period. According to the Mann-Kendall and TSA methods, climatic parameters have changed during recent years in most of the studied stations and climate change is responsible for Oshtorankooh TSLE variation, so that the TSLE during the studied statistical period demonstrated an upward movement in four orientations (North, South, East, West).The largest variation between December and the other months (January and February) was observed between 2004 and 2016 247.18 km(2), 76.05 km(2), and 249.64 km(2), respectively."
1,"Heat Related Illness (HRI) in dogs is expected to increase as heatwaves surge due to global warming. The most severe form of HRI, heat stroke, is potentially fatal in dogs. The current study investigated the incidence and risk factors for HRI in dogs in NSW, Australia, from 1997 to 2017. We identified 119 HRI cases during this period, with a fatality rate of 23%. Dog breeds at elevated risk of HRI were Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dog, British Bulldog, French Bulldog, Maremma Sheepdog, Italian Greyhound, Chow Chow, Airedale Terrier, Pug, Samoyed, English Springer Spaniel, Labrador Retriever, Golden Retriever, Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, Border Collie, Staffordshire Bull Terrier, and pooled non-Australian National Kennel Council breeds (which included the American and Australian Bulldog) when compared with cross breeds (i.e., the reference variable). As expected, HRI cases were more likely in December and January, during the Australian summer and during hotter years (e.g., 2016). There were no differences in the risk of HRI between males and females nor between desexed or un-desexed dogs; but older dogs were at increased risk of HRI. These findings underscore the need for data collection that will enable the incidence of HRI in dogs to be monitored and to better understand canine risk factors particularly as temperatures will continue to rise due to global warming. The risk of mortality from HRI underpins the need for education programs focussed on prevention and early identification of HRI so that owners present affected dogs to their veterinarian as promptly as possible."
0,"The health of many marine, coastal, freshwater, and other aquatic ecosystems is inextricably linked to decisions about the management of water quality and quantity. In this article we review the economic literature aimed at quantifying the impacts of water resource management on aquatic species in the United States and the potential welfare gains of managing water and aquatic species systems jointly. Existing studies consider multiple water uses, such as agricultural irrigation and hydropower generation, as well as different societal benefits from aquatic species, such as commercial and recreational fishing and endangered species preservation. These studies use a variety of methodologies, including stated and revealed preference techniques, bioeconomic modeling, and reduced-form econometrics. We conclude with a discussion of future directions for research that could increase understanding of the trade-offs between water and aquatic species management outcomes and identify gains from the joint management of water resources and aquatic species in the United States."
1,"Longer and more severe drought periods are expected in the near future for Mediterranean ecosystems. Soil enzymes play an essential role in the nutrient mineralization and their activity is an exceptional sensor in predicting the capacity of nutrient supply to plants. We conducted an experiment of water availability manipulation in evergreen oak mountain stands with the aim to study the effects of enhanced drought on the activity of five soil enzymes. The drought treatment consisted of runoff exclusion by a ditch along the entire top edge of the upper part of treatment plots and partial rain exclusion by suspending PVC strips and funnels. The reduction of 10% of soil moisture produced by runoff exclusion decreased urease activity by 10-67%, protease activity by 15-66% and beta-glucosidase activity by 10-80%, depending on annual period and soil depth. The reduction of 21% of soil moisture produced by runoff and rainfall exclusion together reduced urease activity by 42-60%, protease activity by 35-45%, beta-glucosidase activity by 35-83% and acid phosphatase activity by 31-40%. No significant effects were observed on alkaline phosphatase activity. The activities of the enzymes involved in the nitrogen cycle, protease and urease, were the most affected by drought. In all cases, the activities of these enzymes strongly decreased with soil depth and they were greater in spring than in autumn. These results show the link between drought and a slower nutrient turn-over, which decreases the nutrient supply to plants. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
1,"Flooding regimes in arid and semi-arid regions are heavily influenced by climate change and water shortage, water regulations, and increased water demands. Wetlands managed as part of regulated water systems in agricultural landscapes often require external water supplies to sustain or support desired properties or services. Therefore, water resource managers must weigh water requirements necessary to support wetland functions alongside other water demands. This paper presents a simple method of using a modified climate diagram to display net water requirements for a managed wetland in Van, China. The net water requirements were estimated using the DRAINMOD simulation model by assuming that evaporation is the only path for water loss. For this case study, the ratio of water supply to air temperature was adjusted to 1:1. Three water supply estimates were generated to support a desired water table depth of 30 cm for 5%, 12.5%, and 25% of the growing season in Xi'an. When water supply reaches or exceeds a curve, it creates a wetter condition than that represented by the curve. The results also indicate that timing of recharge is very important in preserving wetland hydrology in dry regions. This modified climate diagram prompts an intuitive understanding of the relationship between recharge and consequent wetness of a wetland. It may be used as a standard tool for determining adequate water demand in and regional water resources management that considers wetland protection or restoration. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

1,"The ongoing climate crisis merits an urgent need to devise management approaches and new technologies to reduce atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations (GHG) in the near term. However, each year that GHG concentrations continue to rise, pressure mounts to develop and deploy atmospheric CO2 removal pathways as a complement to, and not replacement for, emissions reductions. Soil carbon sequestration (SCS) practices in working lands provide a low-tech and cost-effective means for removing CO2 from the atmosphere while also delivering co-benefits to people and ecosystems. Our model estimates suggest that, assuming additive effects, the technical potential of combined SCS practices can provide 30%-70% of the carbon removal required by the Paris Climate Agreement if applied to 25%-50% of the available global land area, respectively. Atmospheric CO2 drawdown via SCS has the potential to last decades to centuries, although more research is needed to determine the long-term viability at scale and the durability of the carbon stored. Regardless of these research needs, we argue that SCS can at least serve as a bridging technology, reducing atmospheric CO2 in the short term while energy and transportation systems adapt to a low-C economy. Soil C sequestration in working lands holds promise as a climate change mitigation tool, but the current rate of implementation remains too slow to make significant progress toward global emissions goals by 2050. Outreach and education, methodology development for C offset registries, improved access to materials and supplies, and improved research networks are needed to accelerate the rate of SCS practice implementation. Herein, we present an argument for the immediate adoption of SCS practices in working lands and recommendations for improved implementation."
1,"Exchange of carbon between the ocean and the atmosphere is a key process that influences past climates via glacial-interglacial variations of the CO2 concentration. The melting of ice sheets during deglaciations induces a sea level rise which leads to the flooding of coastal land areas, resulting in the transfer of terrestrial organic matter to the ocean. However, the consequences of such fluxes on the ocean biogeochemical cycle and on the uptake and release of CO2 are poorly constrained. Moreover, this potentially important exchange of carbon at the land-sea interface is not represented in most Earth system models. We present here the implementation of terrestrial organic matter fluxes into the ocean at the transiently changing land-sea interface in the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology Earth System Model (MPI-ESM) and investigate their effect on the biogeochemistry during the last deglaciation. Our results show that during the deglaciation, most of the terrestrial organic matter inputs to the ocean occurs during Meltwater Pulse 1a (between 15-14 ka) which leads to the transfer of 21.2 GtC of terrestrial carbon (mostly originating from wood and humus) to the ocean. Although this additional organic matter input is relatively small in comparison to the global ocean inventory (0.06 %) and thus does not have an impact on the global CO2 flux, the terrestrial organic matter fluxes initiate oceanic outgassing in regional hotspots like in Indonesia for a few hundred years. Finally, sensitivity experiments highlight that terrestrial organic matter fluxes are the drivers of oceanic outgassing in flooded coastal regions during Meltwater Pulse 1a. Furthermore, the magnitude of outgassing is rather insensitive to higher carbon-to-nutrient ratios of the terrestrial organic matter. Our results provide a first estimate of the importance of terrestrial organic matter fluxes in a transient deglaciation simulation. Moreover, our model development is an important step towards a fully coupled carbon cycle in an Earth system model applicable to simulations at glacial-interglacial cycles."
1,"Potato cyst nematodes (PCN) are responsible for large losses in potato yields in many of the world's potato-growing regions. As soil temperatures increase due to climate change, there is potential for faster growth rates of PCN, allowing development of multiple generations in a growing season. We develop a process-based temperature-dependent model representing the life cycle of Globodera pallida, comprising juvenile, adult and cyst/diapause stages. To incorporate variability in the amount of time spent in each stage caused by genetic/environmental variation, the model is based on a mix of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with sub-stages, and delay differential equations (DDEs). The effect of climate change is incorporated through the influence of soil temperature on the rate of development and survival in the hatching and juvenile stages. The level of the plant resistance to PCN is incorporated via the proportion of juveniles which become adults. After comparing the model with field data we run simulations to explore the effects of temperature and resistance on PCN populations. We find that with higher temperatures and longer growing seasons multiple generations of PCN can develop within a season, provided any required diapause period is short. Despite this, we show that growing resistant potatoes is a very effective control strategy and planting potatoes with even moderate levels of resistance can counter the effects of climate change.

1,"Climate change is widely recognized as one of the most significant challenges facing our planet and human civilization. Human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, leading to a warming of the Earth's climate. The relationship between climate change and cardiovascular (CV) health, mediated by air pollution and increased ambient temperatures, is complex and very heterogeneous. The main mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of CV disease at extreme temperatures involve several regulatory pathways, including temperature-sympathetic reactivity, the cold-activated renin-angiotensin system, dehydration, extreme temperature-induced electrolyte imbalances, and heat stroke-induced systemic inflammatory responses. The interplay of these mechanisms may vary based on individual factors, environmental conditions, and an overall health background. The net outcome is a significant increase in CV mortality and a higher incidence of hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), heart failure, and cardiac arrhythmias. Patients with pre-existing CV disorders may be more vulnerable to the effects of global warming and extreme temperatures. There is an urgent need for a comprehensive intervention that spans from the individual level to a systemic or global approach to effectively address this existential problem. Future programs aimed at reducing CV and environmental burdens should require cross-disciplinary collaboration involving physicians, researchers, public health workers, political scientists, legislators, and national leaders to mitigate the effects of climate change."
1,"The ecological transition zones also known as ecotones are specific ecosystems but how global change will affect their biodiversity and functioning is poorly understood. In the case of the areas at the interface between riparian forest and salt meadows the biodiversity conservation remains a major issue. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of a salty environment on Fraxinus angustifolia a non-halophyte species. For this, the photochemistry of PSII was in situ explored during the summer between 2007 and 2016. The predawn maximum quantum efficiency of PSII (Fv/Fm) was always greater than 0.8 which indicates an absence of chronic photo inhibition induced by salinity. During these years, the light kinetic of the actual quantum yield of PSII (Phi(PSII)) was studied. It appears that this yield is generally higher in salty environments than in the riparian forest. Multivariate analysis, showed that the dissipation regulated light energy faction (Phi(NPQ)), the photochemical quenching (qP) and the Fd/Fs ratio constitute the main explanatory variables of Phi(PSII) changes. The subsequent two-wayANCOVA carried out demonstrated that Phi(NPQ) was weaker in saline environments, suggesting a better efficiency of photosystem collecting antennas. Meanwhile, the analysis of photosynthetic pigments did not exhibited a salt effect except the significant accumulation of chlorophyll a in 2016. In order to address the question of the salt-related toxicity, sodium ion contents in the leaves were found to be identical in the two sites, suggesting the establishment of an energy-dependent mechanism of salt exclusion/retention in roots. The growth rings of F. angustifolia in saline areas highly follows the annual water deficit changes. Between 2007 and 2016, the biomass in the salt meadow was higher with a peak in 2011 representing 60% of the biomass of control individuals. But, since 2011 a continuous decline of growth was recorded. Water conditions seem to constitute a limiting factor even if the photosynthetic apparatus generates the excess metabolic energy necessary to cope with the saline toxicity. This study thus highlighted the plasticity of the photochemistry of the PSII depending to the environmental conditions of the salt meadows. It also shows the vulnerability of an ecotone through the decline in the productivity of a glycophyte with climate change. This augurs for changes in the composition of plant communities which is in favor of strict halophytes."
1,"Japanese honeysuckle is one of the most aggressive invasive vines in forestlands of the southern United States. We analyzed field data collected by the U.S. Forest Service to identify potential determinants of invasion and to predict likelihood of further invasion under a variety of possible management strategies. Results of logistic regression, which classified 74% of the field plots correctly with regard to species presence and absence, indicated probability of invasion is correlated positively with adjacency to water bodies, temperature, site productivity, species diversity, and private land ownership, and is correlated negatively with slope, stand age, artificial regeneration, distance to the nearest road, and fire disturbance. Habitats most at risk to further invasion under current conditions occur throughout Mississippi, stretching northward across western Tennessee and western Kentucky, westward across southern Arkansas, eastward across north-central Alabama, and also occur in several counties scattered within Virginia. Invasion likelihoods could be increased by global climate change and reduced most by conversion to public land ownership, followed by artificial regeneration, and fire disturbance. While conversion of land ownership may not be feasible, this result suggests the opportunity for decreasing the likelihood of invasions on private lands via using selected management practices."
1,"Historical biodiversity datasets provide invaluable opportunities to examine changes in natural populations, especially with respect to land use and climate change. In 2020, we resurveyed the amphibian community at Powdermill Nature Reserve in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, U.S.A. using pitfall traps, replicating surveys that were conducted in 1982-1983. We compared species richness and abundance across the two time periods and examined the potential influence of temperature on capture rates. Species richness was relatively stable, but species composition varied across sampling periods. Most notably, the majority of captures (60.6%) in the 1980s were anurans, and the majority of captures (91.2%) in 2020 were salamanders. Anuran captures peaked earlier in 2020 compared to the 1980s, and salamander captures peaked later in the season, but capture rate was not significantly related to temperature for either group. Shills in relative abundance should be examined further to determine if these represent temporary or permanent changes."
1,"GRACE and ICESat Antarctic mass-balance differences are resolved utilizing their dependencies on corrections for changes in mass and volume of the same underlying mantle material forced by ice-loading changes. Modeled gravimetry corrections are 5.22 times altimetry corrections over East Antarctica (EA) and 4.51 times over West Antarctica (WA), with inferred mantle densities 4.75 and 4.11 g cm(-3). Derived sensitivities (S-g, S-a) to bedrock motion enable calculation of motion (delta B-0) needed to equalize GRACE and ICESat mass changes during 2003-08. For EA, delta B-0 is -2.2 mm a(-1) subsidence with mass matching at 150 Gt a(-1), inland WA is -3.5 mm a(-1) at 66 Gt a(-1), and coastal WA is only -0.35 mm a(-1) at -95 Gt a(-1). WA subsidence is attributed to low mantle viscosity with faster responses to post-LGM deglaciation and to ice growth during Holocene grounding-line readvance. EA subsidence is attributed to Holocene dynamic thickening. With Antarctic Peninsula loss of -26 Gt a(-1), the Antarctic total gain is 95 +/- 25 Gt a(-1) during 2003-08, compared to 144 +/- 61 Gt a(-1) from ERS1/2 during 1992-2001. Beginning in 2009, large increases in coastal WA dynamic losses overcame long-term EA and inland WA gains bringing Antarctica close to balance at -12 +/- 64 Gt a(-1) by 2012-16."
0,"Emerging infectious diseases are increasingly recognized as key threats to wildlife. Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), the causative agent of chytridiomycosis, has been implicated in widespread amphibian declines and is currently the largest infectious disease threat to biodiversity. Here, we review the causes of Bd emergence, its impact on amphibian populations and the ecology of Bd transmission. We describe studies to answer outstanding issues, including the origin of the pathogen, the effect of Bd relative to other causes of population declines, the modes of Bd dispersal, and factors influencing the intensity of its transmission. Chytridiomycosis is an archetypal emerging disease, with a broad host range and significant impacts on host populations and, as such, poses a crucial challenge for wildlife managers and an urgent conservation concern."
1,"A short span of abnormal precipitation in the year 2018 has ravaged the southwestern state of Kerala. It has resulted in widespread flooding and landslides with more than 400 casualties. The present study has implemented the SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar)-based Sentinel 1C band satellite data. The researchers have analyzed the remotely sensed data to examine the severely affected areas. The study area included Alappuzha, Kottayam, Thrissur, and Pathanamthitta districts. The daily and monthly precipitation data is acquired from the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM). During 2018, Kerala has experienced a severe escalation in the volume of rainfall from June onwards till September. The current study has analyzed the spatial and temporal variation in the extent of severe flooding in Kerala during the monsoon months of 2018. The south-central parts of Kerala are most severely impacted by flooding. The districts of Alappuzha and Kottayam were severely affected, followed by Thrissur and Pathanamthitta, moderate to low. The outcomes of this assessment would be helpful for risk-informed planning in the pre-disaster context and help in decision-making for response planning and early recovery. (c) 2021 COSPAR.

1,"Agrometeorological services, as part of weather and climate services, are expected to play a key role in supporting sub-Saharan agriculture facing climate change and variability. In the Sahel, smallholder farmers relying on rainfed crop production systems are particularly vulnerable to climate change and variability because of low resilience and coping capacity. The provision of agrometeorological services is growing across Africa, but they often remain inaccessible for the majority of smallholder farmers or are not very relevant to support on-the-ground decision-making. Our work aims to demonstrate the hypothesis that agrometeorological services can effectively improve agricultural productivity and sustainability provided that appropriate mechanisms are put in place to ensure access, uptake and action. The paper illustrates the case study of Burkina Faso, where the National Meteorological Service, with the support of the World Meteorological Organization, engaged in the provision of accessible, reliable and relevant agrometeorological services for farmers. The study demonstrates that farmers, even in remote rural areas, are willing to profit from weather and climate services for strategic and tactical decisions in agricultural management because of relevant economic benefit. These benefits can be summarized as a 40% reduction in production costs and a 41% increase in income. Results also highlight environmental positive impacts such as the reduction by 50% in the use of fertilizers. Nevertheless, the study concludes that in order to scale-up weather and climate services in West Africa, a new business model released from the development projects approach should be explored."
0,"Museum collections are critical to contemporary biological research, but museum acquisitions have declined in recent decades, hampering researchers' ability to use collections to assess species responses to habitat modification, urbanization, and global climate change. Citizen science may be a key method to bolster museum collections data, particularly from urban regions, where ongoing data collection is critical to our understanding of ecosystem dynamics in a highly modified and variable landscape. In this study, we compare data collected as part of the citizen-science project Reptiles and Amphibians of Southern California (RASCals), hosted on the platform iNaturalist (www.inaturalist.org), to data in the VertNet database (www.vertnet.org), which houses millions of museum collection records from over 250 natural-history collections, for four focal species, including a native lizard of conservation concern that has declined with urbanization, a native lizard that is widespread in urban areas, and two invasive aquatic species. We compared numbers of VertNet records over time to modern RASCals records, and the number of records collected from urban, suburban, and protected areas from both databases. For all species, citizen-science records were generated much more rapidly than museum records. For three of our four focal species, RASCals participants over 27 months documented from 70 to 750% more records than were added to the VertNet database after 1990. For the urban-tolerant southern alligator lizard, RASCals participants collected nearly 45 times more modern urban records than are contained in the VertNet database. For all other species, the majority of RASCals records were collected within suburban or other highly modified landscapes, demonstrating the value of citizen science for collecting data within urban and suburban ecosystems. As new museum acquisitions decline, citizen-science projects like RASCals may become critical to the maintenance of modern species-distribution data."
1,"Growing flood risks raise difficult questions regarding risk perception, protective actions, and government response. Drawing on behavioral decision theory, protection motivation theory, and the protective action decision model, we examine the roles risk salience and immediacy, response efficacy, and trust in government authorities play in perceptions of flood risk and adoption of protective actions, with a focus on flood insurance. Data come from focus group discussions conducted in 2 flood-affected neighborhoods in Troy, New York, United States of America. Troy has a history of flooding, including major floods linked to Hurricane Irene in 2011. While several participants had vivid memories of past floods, overall salience of flood risk was low. While they recognized responsiveness of local government at the time of hazard events, they expressed concern about inadequate preparation for future disasters. Participants expressed concern about flood insurance, citing costs, inadequate coverage, and arduous procedures needed to file claims. They expressed distrust in the institutions surrounding flood insurance. We argue that emergency managers will need to be responsive to people's multiple concerns in order to build the awareness and trust on which effective natural hazard preparedness depends."
1,"Aim Species' climatic niches may be poorly predicted by regional climate estimates used in species distribution models (SDMs) due to microclimatic buffering of local conditions. Here, we compare SDMs generated using a locally validated below-canopy microclimate model to those based on interpolated weather station data at two spatial scales to determine the effects of scale and topography on potential future below-canopy warming and species distributions. Location Great Smoky Mountains National Park (2,090 km(2); NC, TN, USA). Time period 1970-2006, late-century warming. Major taxa studied Vascular plant species of Southern Appalachian forests. Methods We compared the fit and spatio-temporal predictions of SDMs generated using occurrence records of 154 plant species and three climate models: macroclimate (1 km, WorldClim), downscaled climate (based on a 30-m digital elevation model), and fine-scale microclimate (30 m) from a below-canopy sensor network. Results We found that, although SDM fit was similar across models, microclimate-derived SDMs predicted substantially greater species persistence with 4 degrees C of regional warming, with a difference of 50% of the species pool in some areas. Microclimate models predicted that warming trends will be buffered in high-elevation and near-stream habitats. Microclimate SDMs predicted higher stability of mid-elevation species, particularly in thermally buffered areas near streams, and critically, less change in species composition at high elevation. In contrast, predictions of macroclimate and downscaled climate models were similar despite improved resolution. Main conclusions Our results demonstrate that careful selection of climate drivers, including local near-ground validation rather than downscaling solely with elevation, is critical for projecting distributions. They also suggest that some species at risk from climate change might persist, even with 4 degrees C of macroclimate warming, in cryptic refugia buffered by microclimate, pointing to the roles of forest cover and topography in explaining slower-than-expected changes in understorey communities. However, certain species, such as those currently occurring on low-elevation ridges that are sensitive to atmospheric changes, may be at more risk than macroclimate or downscaled climate SDMs suggest."
1,"Worldwide glacier mass changes are considered to represent natural key variables within global climate-related monitoring programmes, especially with respect to strategies concerning early detection of enhanced,greenhouse effects on climate. This is due to the fact that glacier mass changes provide important quantitative information on rates of change, acceleration tendencies and pre-industrial variability relating to energy exchange at the earth/athmosphere interface. During the coming decades, excess radiation income and sensible heat (a few watts per square metre) as calculated with numerical climate models are both estimated to increase by a factor of about two to four as compared to the mean of the 20th century. The rate of average annual mass loss (a few decimetres per year) measured today on mountain glaciers in various parts of the world now appears to accelerate accordingly, even though detailed interpretation of the complex processes involved remains difficult. Within the framework of secular glacier retreat and Holocene glacier fluctuations, similar rates of change and acceleration must have taken place before, i.e. during times of weak anthropogenic forcing. However, the anthropogenic influences on the atmosphere could now and for die first time represent a major contributing factor to the observed glacier shrinkage at a global scale. Problems with such assessments mainly concern aspects of statistical averaging, regional climate variability, strong differences in glacier sensitivity and relations between mass balance and cumulative glacier length change over decadal to secular time scales. Considerable progress has recently been achieved in these fields of research."
1,"Hurri hills (HH) is an ungazetted mountain range in the northern part of Kenya in Marsabit County, harbouring a diverse range of ecosystems. The mountain range has been experiencing land conversion for town expansion, agricultural production and settlements threatening ecosystem service (ES) provision. Sustaining ES provision under increasing anthropogenic pressures is one of the challenges of the HH community. We used focus group discussions (FGD) in seven locations involving eighty-two participants to identify ES, their importance, perceived drivers of change and the potential impacts on these ES. Preference ranking and Content analysis were used to determine the frequency of ES and their threats. The Jaccard similarity coefficient (J) was used to compute the similarity in ES and their threats in different locations. The FGD identified over 40 ES categorised under-provisioning, regulating, supporting and cultural services. The primary ES provided by HH includes water (both domestic and livestock), pasture, fuelwood, thatch grass, cultural sites, cultural material, wildlife habitat, agriculture /settlement, and climate regulation. The Jaccard index of similarity varied at 0.73 for ES, 0.27 for forage species, 0.52 for fuelwood species, 0.29 for medicinal species and 0.36 species for building purposes while the index for threats to ES provision was 0.91. The study established the presence of wildlife species of both local and international importance classified between, near threatened and endangered. Overgrazing, unsustainable utilisation of forest resources, deforestation and climate change were the main drivers impacting ES provision. These results underline the significance of HH as a biological and socio-economic system to the local population. These results further support the need for community centred participatory resource use planning that integrates the inherent threats to the provision of ES in the HH ecosystem. The study recommends undertaking a detailed baseline survey to establish the status and distribution of the main plant and animal taxa to advise the viability of establishing community conservancies in a bid to conserve the ecosystem."
1,"In light of recently accelerating global warming, the changes in vegetation trends are vital for the monitoring of the dynamics of both whole ecosystems and individual species. Detecting changes within the time series of specific forest ecosystems or species is very important in the context of assessing their vulnerability to climate change and other negative phenomena. Hence, the aim of this paper was to identify the trend change points and periods of greening and browning in multi-annual time series of the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) of four main forest-forming tree species in the temperate zone: pine, spruce, oak and beech. The research was conducted over the last two decades (2002-2022), and was based on vegetation indices data derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). To this end, several research approaches, including calculating the linear trends in the moving periods and BEAST algorithm, were adapted. A pattern of browning then greening then constant was detected for coniferous species, mostly pine. In turn, for broadleaved species, namely oak and beech, a pattern of greening then constant was identified, without the initial phase of browning. The main trend change points seem to be ca. 2006 and ca. 2015 for coniferous species and solely around 2015 for deciduous ones."
1,"Efforts to understand population dynamics and identify high-quality habitat require information about spatial variation in demographic parameters. However, estimating demographic parameters typically requires labor-intensive capture-recapture methods that are difficult to implement over large spatial extents. Spatially explicit integrated population models (IPMs) provide a solution by accommodating spatial capture-recapture (SCR) data collected at a small number of sites with survey data that may be collected over a much larger extent. We extended the spatial IPM framework to include a spatio-temporal point process model for recruitment, and we applied the model to 4 yr of SCR and distance-sampling data on Canada Warblers (Cardellina canadensis) near the southern extent of the species' breeding range in North Carolina, USA, where climate change is predicted to cause population declines and distributional shifts toward higher elevations. To characterize spatial variation in demographic parameters over the climate gradient in our study area, we modeled density, survival, and per capita recruitment as functions of elevation. We used a male-only model because males comprised >90% of our point-count detections. Apparent survival was low but increased with elevation, from 0.040 (95% credible interval [Cl]: 0.0032-0.12) at 900 m to 0.29 (95% CI: 0.16-0.42) at 1,500 m. Recruitment was not strongly associated with elevation, yet density varied greatly, from <0.03 males ha -1 below 1,000 m to >0.2 males ha -1 above 1,400 m. Point estimates of population growth rate were <1 at all elevations, but 95% Cls included 1. Additional research is needed to assess the possibility of a long-term decline and to examine the effects of abiotic variables and biotic interactions on the demographic parameters influencing the species' distribution. The modeling framework developed here provides a platform for addressing these issues and advancing knowledge about spatial demography and population dynamics."
1,"On mountains, unique in their steep and rapid climatic gradients, many insects are shifting their elevational range limits to track recent temperature change. In a review of the range shift literature to date, most of the 1478 montane insect populations tested so far are shifting to higher elevations, but there is conspicuous variation in the responses. We discuss the impact of study methodology as well as potential abiotic and biotic factors that may underlie this variation in climate change response. We encourage more empirical studies spanning greater insect biodiversity and directly testing how variation in species' traits, biogeography, and abiotic-biotic context shapes variation in range shift responses."
1,"Human actions have both intentionally and unintentionally altered the global economy of nitrogen (N), with both positive and negative consequences for human health and welfare, the environment and climate change. Here we examine long-term trends in reactive N (Nr) creation and efficiencies of Nr use within the continental US. We estimate that human actions in the US have increased Nr inputs by at least similar to 5 times compared to pre-industrial conditions. Whereas N-2 fixation as a by-product of fossil fuel combustion accounted for similar to 1/4 of Nr inputs from the 1970s to 2000 (or similar to 7 Tg N year(-1)), this value has dropped substantially since then (to < 5 Tg N year(-1)), owing to Clean Air Act amendments. As of 2007, national N use efficiency (NUE) of all combined N inputs was equal to similar to 40 %. This value increases to 55 % when considering intentional N inputs alone, with food, industrial goods, fuel and fiber production accounting for the largest Nr sinks, respectively. We estimate that 66 % of the N lost during the production of goods and services enters the air (as NO (x) , NH3, N2O and N-2), with the remaining 34 % lost to various waterways. These Nr losses contribute to smog formation, acid rain, eutrophication, biodiversity declines and climate change. Hence we argue that an improved national NUE would: (i) benefit the US economy on the production side; (ii) reduce social damage costs; and (iii) help avoid some major climate change risks in the future."
1,"Aim: The nested pattern in the geographical distribution of three Indian owlets, resulting in a gradient of endemicity, is hypothesized to be an impact of historical climate change. In current time, the Forest Owlet Athene blewitti is endemic to central India, and its range is encompassed within the ranges of the Jungle Owlet Glaucidium radiatum (distributed through South Asia) and Spotted Owlet Athene brama (distributed through Iran, South and Southeast Asia). Another phylogenetically close species, Little Owl Athene noctua, which is largely Palearctic in distribution, is hypothesized to have undergone severe range reduction during the Last Glacial Maximum, showing a postglacial expansion. The present study tests hypotheses on the possible role of Quaternary climatic fluctuations in shaping geographical ranges of owlets. Methods: We used primary field observations, open access data, and climatic niche modeling to construct climatic niches of four owlets for four periods, the Last Interglacial (similar to 120-140Ka), Last Glacial Maximum (similar to 22Ka), Mid-Holocene (similar to 6Ka), and Current (1960-1990). We performed climatic niche extent, breadth, and overlap analyses and tested if climatically suitable areas for owlets are nested in a relatively stable climate. Results: Climatically suitable areas for all owlets examined underwent cycles of expansion and reduction or a gradual expansion or reduction since the Last Interglacial. The Indian owlets show significant climatic niche overlap in the current period. Climatically suitable areas for Little Owl shifted southwards during the Last Glacial Maximum and expanded northwards in the postglaciation period. For each owlet, the modeled climatic niches were nested in climatically stable areas. Main Conclusions: The study highlights the impact of Quaternary climate change in shaping the present distribution of owlets. This is relevant to the current scenario of climate change and global warming and can help inform conservation strategies, especially for the extremely range-restricted Forest Owlet."
1,"Complex interactions of ecological and climate indicators play a vital role in defining spatiotemporal patterns of vector-borne disease habitats and transmission. Vietnam is in the sub-tropical climate zone with high humidity and abundant precipitation, while unevenly distributed precipitation leads to frequently annual occurrence of drought and flooding. The increase in frequency and magnitude of severe weather extremes likely linked to climate change and anthropogenic processes highlights the demands of research in GeoHealth risk and adaptive capacity assessment. In this study, mapping vector-borne disease is made for revealing physical features of ecological indicators and its association with vector-borne diseases and adaptive capacity to illustrate how remotely sensed data products have been utilized in GeoHealth applications, surveillance, and vector-borne disease risk mapping in Vietnam. Additionally, it is to promise the possibilities of establishing disease early-warning systems with citizen participation and provide knowledge to support ecological and human health diseases research."
0,"The goal of this cross-sectional qualitative study was to assess the impact of climate change on Sami youth health, health care access, and health-seeking behaviour. Indigenous research methodology served as the basis of the investigation which utilised focus groups of youths and one-on-one interviews of adult community leaders using a semi-structured, open-ended questions. The results of the focus groups and interviews were then analysed to identify trends. We found that Sami youth mostly associate the implications of climate change to their culture andcultural practices rather than the historical influence the environment had on Sami health. They also take part in unique health-seeking behaviour by utilising both traditional and Western medicine simultaneously but without interaction due to social and structural factors. Our findings suggest that the health of Sami teens is not tied to the environment directly, but through cultural activities."
1,"The United States is a global grain supplier. Agriculture uses 22% of all US transported tonnage with grain being the largest component(1). Crop mix shifts are an often cited consequence of climate change(2-4) and such shifts may change the demands grain places on the transport system. Studies also find that climate change could decrease Great Lakes water levels(5-8), shorten the duration of ice cover in the winter(9-11) and alter grain supplies in grain-exporting countries(12). This study investigates the effects of such phenomena on US grain transportation movements both in volumes and modes. Specifically we examine the effects of possible shifts in: crop production patterns; Great Lakes water levels; winter navigation possibilities; and foreign grain production. We find that crop mix shifts reduce the importance of Lower Mississippi River ports, but increase the role of Pacific Northwest ports, Great Lakes ports and Atlantic ports. We also find a shift from barge to rail and truck transport. Conversely, a longer navigation season or a reduction in Great Lake water levels increases grain shipments to the ports in the Lower Mississippi River. Higher use of Great Lakes ports occurs under a reduction of grain production in European exporting countries that compete with Great Lakes ports."
1,"The Elephant Marsh lies on the floodplain of the lower Shire River, in southern Malawi. It is both a cultivated, seasonal floodplain and an area of permanent shallow lakes. The marsh is highly biodiverse, has a productive fishery and supports the livelihoods of a large human population. Chronicles and hand-drawn sketches by 19th-century explorers and subsequent travellers describing the marsh landscape were used to develop an account of the marsh's historic hydromorphology. These anecdotal accounts are supported by Shire River outflows from Lake Malawi, inferred from observed water levels in the lake from c. 1900. Records show that the marsh has experienced regular periods of drying out, followed by periods of greater inundation than it currently experiences. Long-term hydrological trends have been accompanied by anthropogenic influences such as catchment degradation and embankment construction, which have altered sedimentation patterns in the marsh. The marsh exhibits traits of resilience to natural long-term climate change through its ability to return to a similar state during wet periods, even following prolonged dry periods. Over relatively short time frames, however, the ecology of the marsh, as described when it was declared a RAMSAR site in 2017, likely has low resistance to hydrological regimes that are sensitive to climate change. An appreciation of long-term climate and recent human-induced changes afforded a unique opportunity for contextualising its hydromorphological trends within the Anthropocene."
0,"Advances in Earth Observation (EO) technology, particularly over the last two decades, have shown that soil moisture content (SMC) can be measured to some degree or other by all regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, and a variety of techniques have been proposed to facilitate this purpose. In this review we provide a synthesis of the efforts made during the last 20 years or so towards the estimation of surface SMC exploiting EO imagery, with a particular emphasis on retrievals from microwave sensors. Rather than replicating previous overview works, we provide a comprehensive and critical exploration of all the major approaches employed for retrieving SMC in a range of different global ecosystems. In this framework, we consider the newest techniques developed within optical and thermal infrared remote sensing, active and passive microwave domains, as well as assimilation or synergistic approaches. Future trends and prospects of EO for the accurate determination of SMC from space are subject to key challenges, some of which are identified and discussed within. It is evident from this review that there is potential for more accurate estimation of SMC exploiting EO technology, particularly so, by exploring the use of synergistic approaches between a variety of EO instruments. Given the importance of SMC in Earth's land surface interactions and to a large range of applications, one can appreciate that its accurate estimation is critical in addressing key scientific and practical challenges in today's world such as food security, sustainable planning and management of water resources.

1,"Transition zones between mountain forests and treeless tundra, i.e. treeline ecotones, are characterized by great regional variety. In this paper, we discuss the biodiversity in various trophic levels in treeline ecotones throughout Europe, with particular focus on recent changes in land use and climate in northern and central mountains. In northernmost Europe, mountain birch prevails, while conifers (spruce, pine, larch) are the dominating species further south. While at continent-wide to global scales, the ecotone position is largely controlled by heat deficiency, it depends on a multitude of partly interacting abiotic and biotic factors other than climate at smaller scales. Climate change is a driving factor in treeline ecotone change, including physiognomic structure and biodiversity, although the effects of climate and other factors often overlap. Historical legacy plays an important role in this respect, and human impacts are particularly important. The recent decline in pastoral use of many European treeline areas often strongly influences plant diversity and re-growth of trees and other woody species. Climate change together with changing tree cover may influence snow cover, moisture regime, and nutrient conditions. Subsequently changed site conditions influence plant-plant interactions, favoring some species and disfavoring others, and plant-animal interactions. Native animals may cause widespread or local disturbances in treeline ecotone areas. Mass outbreaks of leaf-eating insects, for example, usually affect comparatively large forested areas whereas mammalian herbivores and birds have more local impact. However, high numbers of wild or domestic mammalian herbivores may challenge the carrying capacity of treeline ecotone areas at the same time as they preserve an open pasture character. This calls for cross-disciplinary study approaches, addressing the complexity of the ecotone regarding both causal background and biogeographic diversity."
1,"Hamoon-Jazmoorian plain is located in southeast of Iran. Overexploitation of groundwater in this plain has led to water level decline and caused serious problems such as land subsidence, aquifer destruction and water quality degradation. The increasing population and agricultural development along with drought and climate change, have further increased the pressure on water resources in this region over the last years. In order to overcome such crisis, introduction of surface water into an aquifer at particular locations can be a suitable solution. A wide variety of methods have been developed to recharge groundwater, one of which is aquifer storage and recovery (ASR). One of the fundamental principles of making such systems is delineation of suitable areas based on scientific and natural facts in order to achieve relevant objectives. To that end, the Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) in conjunction with the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) was applied in this study. More specifically, nine main parameters including depth of runoff as the considered source of water, morphology of the earth surface features such as geology, geomorphology, land use and land cover, drainage and aquifer characteristics along with quality of water in the aquifer were considered as the main layers in GIS. The runoff water available for artificial recharge in the basin was estimated through Soil Conservation Service (SCS) curve number method. The weighted curve number for each watershed was derived through spatial intersection of land use and hydrological soil group layers. Other thematic layers were extracted from satellite images, topographical map, and other collateral data sources, then weighed according to their influence in locating process. The Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method was then used to calculate weights of individual parameters. The normalized weighted layers were then overlaid to build up the recharge potential map. The results revealed that 34% of the total area is suitable and very suitable for groundwater recharge. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
0,"The importance of forests in the provision of ecosystem services that provide multiple benefits to society is increasingly being recognised. These services include climate change and greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation, water quality protection, fibre for timber processing or wood energy and recreation opportunities. However, afforestation targets across Europe are not being met, despite the availability of planting subsidies in some countries. Using Ireland as a case study, this paper uses a novel technique to examine the afforestation participation decision utilising a choice modelling framework, where a revealed preference methodology is applied to the land use change from agriculture to forestry at individual farm level for the first time. The model coefficients are consistent with economic theory relative to the utility maximisation of income, leisure and wealth (long term land value) and suggest that while income is a key driver of the participation decision at individual farm level, the non-pecuniary benefits from farming are also a consideration."
0,"The Chengbi River Basin is a typical karst watershed in Southwest China. Understanding the effects of climate change (CC) and human activities (HAs) on hydrological process is important for regional water resources management and water security. However, a comprehensive assessment of the effects of CC and HAs on runoff dynamics at different time scales in the Chengbi River Basin is still lacking. To address these needs, we used Budyko Mezentsev-Choudhurdy-Yang and Slope change ratio of accumulative quantity methods to assess the contribution of the changing environment to annual and intra-annual runoff changes in the Chengbi River Basin. The results indicated that annual runoff time series was divided into the base phase Ta (1980-1996) and the change phase Tb (1997-2019). Compared to the natural status in Ta, the relative contributions of CC and HAs to the runoff increase in Tb were 154.86% and-54.86%. In addition, the shift in intra-annual runoff occurred in 2007 and was mainly caused by HAs, with a contribution rate of 76.22%. The increase in annual runoff in Tb could be attributed to the positive contribution of rainfall. Changes in rainfall and reservoir construction altered the original state of intra-annual runoff. Furthermore, the high degree of heterogeneity in the surface karst zone increased the runoff coefficient. The spatial unsaturation of the subsurface water-bearing media and rainfall patterns caused a significant lag effect in the response of surface runoff to rainfall. This study can help re-searchers and policy makers to better understand the response of karst runoff to changing environment and provide insights for future water resources management and flood control measures."
0,"Pasture dieback is a syndrome of unknown cause affecting grasses in Australia, creating significant economic losses to farmers by reducing available livestock feed and paddock carrying capacity. RC3 is a commercial plant growth stimulant tri-sodium salt of trimercapto-S-triazine (TMT) and potassium humate as active ingredients. TMT is commonly used for soil and wastewater remediation by capturing and binding heavy metals, while potassium humate is an organic compound used as a plant growth promoter. We investigated the ability of RC3 to restore soil health and productivity under pasture dieback conditions. RC3 was applied on pasture dieback affected paddock replicate plots once, at a rate of 4 mL/m(2), and soil core samples were taken weekly to analyse microbial communities. Plants were collected regularly to measure dry matter and plant morphometrics. Twenty weeks after a single application, dry matter increased in RC3 plots by 900 kg/ha compared to control plots, and at week 48, eleven months after the single application, RC3 plots showed a trend of more grass and dicot species than the control. Morphometric measures suggest minor improvements in dicotyledon plants. Alpha diversity did not change with the application of RC3. Temporal correlation analysis shows that RC3 steadily reduced the presence of genera predominant in poor soils and with extreme environmental conditions over time and prevented the decline of beneficial genera, such as Marmoricola, Actinomadura, Dactylosporangium, and mle1-7."
1,"Mangrove wetlands are important ecosystems, yet human development coupled with climate change threatens mangroves and their large carbon stores. This study seeks to understand the soil carbon dynamics in hydrologically altered mangrove swamps by studying aboveground biomass estimates and belowground soil carbon concentrations in mangrove swamps with high, medium, and low levels of disturbance in Catano, Jobos Bay, and Vieques, Puerto Rico. All three sites were affected by hurricane Maria in 2017, one year prior to the study. As a result of being hit by the Saffir-Simpson category 4 hurricane, the low-disturbance site had almost no living mangroves left during sampling. There was no correlation between level of hydrologic alteration and carbon storage, rather different patterns emerged for each of the three sites. At the highly disturbed location, belowground carbon mass averaged 0.048 +/- 0.001 g-C cm(-3) which increased with increased aboveground biomass. At the moderately disturbed location, belowground carbon mass averaged 0.047 +/- 0.003 g-C cm(-3) and corresponded to distance from open water. At the low-disturbed location, organic carbon was consistent between all sites and inorganic carbon concentrations controlled total carbon mass which averaged 0.048 +/- 0.002 g-C cm(-3). These results suggest that mangroves are adaptive and resilient and have the potential to retain their carbon storage capacities despite hydrologic alterations, but mass carbon storage within mangrove forests can be spatially variable in hydrologically altered conditions."
1,"This study aims to review the existing literature on the past and future effects of climate, land use, and land cover changes on hydropower generation in West Africa (WA), based on listings in the Scopus and Google Scholar databases. This review shows that several African hydropower plants have experienced repeated power disruptions over the last three decades due to climate change and variability but it is less documented how increasing land use and land cover changes around the major dams have impacted the hydrological system and the hydropower generation. In the future, the risks of hydropower in WA may not be equally distributed within a country or region. Despite uncertainties in precipitation and on impacts on streamflow and water level in major basins, climate change is likely to reduce the available water over the range of 10%-20% (15%-40%) for the RCP4.5 (RCP8.5) scenario by 2050, which may considerably affect the water demand across all sectors, including hydropower. However, in the Kainji dam (Niger River basin), models project an increase in rainfall favorable to hydropower production for both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. In contrast, within the Black Volta sub-basin, the intensification of land use is predicted to favor runoff and, consequently, an increase in the generation of Bui hydropower in the near future, even though models predict a rainfall decrease. This increase in land use for agriculture to feed a growing population has other adverse effects that need to be assessed, namely sedimentation and siltation, which are harmful to hydropower plants. Finally, the combined impact of climate and land use changes on the efficiency of hydroelectric infrastructure in WA is not well documented, while sustainable planning and investments in the hydropower sector require consideration of the nexus between climate, land use changes, and water."
0,"This paper presents a narrative review on the utilisation of urban trees and vegetation to reduce air pollution in urban areas. The results show that trees act as a barrier between sources of pollution and population by the objection of airborne particles and exploitation of gaseous emissions through leaf stomata on the plant surface. The factors that affect the extent of air quality improvement by trees depend on their type, air quality index, leaf size and shape, and seasonality. In addition, the geography, climate, demographic and built-environment make-up of the urban entity play major role in this application."
1,"Extreme typhoon events have been increasing due to climate change. In recent years, severe landslides, flooding, and extreme sediment transport have become more easily induced by these events. This study employs dynamic downscaling climate projection data to evaluate riverbed changes and sediment transport processes of the Gaoping River, located in southern Taiwan, under the worst late 20th century conditions and projections for the late 21st century. Results show that the peak runoff discharge in the late 21st century could be 1.48 times larger than that in the late 20th century. This data indicates that the risk potential for overbank and pier scour disasters will increase in the future. However, in contrast to the late 20th century, the thalweg sediment aggradation model indicated 19% less in the late 21st century. An experimental design method was applied to further explore the reasons behind this outKome. It was found that severe riverbed changes correlated negatively with the peak discharge in extreme floods. These findings will greatly assist in understanding riverbed change processes under extreme typhoon events using dynamic downscaling climate change data."
1,"The Pacific Islands region is home to several of the world's biodiversity hotspots, yet its unique flora and fauna are under threat because of biological invasions. These invasions are likely to proliferate as human activity increases and large-scale natural disturbances unfold, exacerbated by climate change. Remote sensing data and techniques provide a feasible method to map and monitor invasive plant species and inform invasive plant species management across the Pacific Islands region. We used case studies taken from literature retrieved from Google Scholar, 3 regional agencies' digital libraries, and 2 online catalogs on invasive plant species management to examine the uptake and challenges faced in the implementation of remote sensing technology in the Pacific region. We synthesized remote sensing techniques and outlined their potential to detect and map invasive plant species based on species phenology, structural characteristics, and image texture algorithms. The application of remote sensing methods to detect invasive plant species was heavily reliant on species ecology, extent of invasion, and available geospatial and remotely sensed image data. However, current mechanisms that support invasive plant species management, including policy frameworks and geospatial data infrastructure, operated in isolation, leading to duplication of efforts and creating unsustainable solutions for the region. For remote sensing to support invasive plant species management in the region, key stakeholders including conservation managers, researchers, and practitioners; funding agencies; and regional organizations must invest, where possible, in the broader geospatial and environmental sector, integrate, and streamline policies and improve capacity and technology access."
1,"Increasing values of atmospheric CO2 and consequent seawater warming, as well as progressive seawater acidification constitute stressors for marine populations that may induce migrations and even local extinctions. We evaluated the separated effects of (1) high predicted temperature levels and (2)10w predicted pH values on fertilization and early development stages of the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus. Three treatments of temperature and pH were tested, according to current seawater conditions and values expected for next century in agreement to the IS92a IPCC scenario. We examined fertilization, cleavage rate, and 3-day larvae development at different times after insemination. We found that while warming accelerated fertilization, embryo and larval development, acidification delayed them. These findings suggest contrasting effects of both stressors, which compromise fertilization and early development of P lividus at its southernmost limit of distribution. Further studies about the combined effects of pH and temperature are required to accurately give insight into global warming effects on marine life."
0,"Ants and termites are used as bioindicators in many ecosystems. Little knowledge is available about them in Togo, especially ants. This study aimed to find out how ants and termites could be used to assess the restoration of former agricultural land. These insect groups were sampled within six transects of 50 x 2 m(2) (using pitfall traps, monoliths, baits for ants and hand sampling for termites) in two consecutive habitats: open area (grassland) and covered area (an artificial forest). Seventeen termite species and 43 ant species were collected. Seven ant species were specific to the covered area against four for the open area, while four unshared species of termite were found in the open area against three in the covered area. The presence of unshared species was linked to vegetation, as Trinervitermes (Holmgren, 1912), a grass feeding termite, was solely found in open area. Also, for some ant species like Cataulacus traegaordhi (Santschi, 1914), Crematogaster (Lund, 1831) species, Oecophylla longinoda (Latreille, 1802) and Tetraponera mocquerysi (Brown, 1960), all arboreal species, vegetation was a determining factor for their presence. The occurrence of these species together with Basidentitermes mactus (Sjostedt, 1911), Strumigenys bernardi (Brown, 1960) and S. sistrura (Bolton, 1983), suggest a more advanced level of restoration of the covered area."
1,"Changing characteristics of hazardous weather-related events have been arousing considerable public interest in recent years. Guangdong is an economically developed province in China and is prone to natural hazards. Using monthly precipitation data covering a period of 1956-2008 from 127 rain gauge stations, the probabilistic behaviors of SPI-based droughts were investigated with copulas functions. Results indicated a higher risk of droughts along the coastal regions and the western Guangdong, particularly the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region. Joint probabilities of droughts with higher intensity and longer duration were found to have relatively even geographical distribution across Guangdong. The northern parts of Guangdong are higher in altitude and have a lower risk of droughts. Identification of regions characterized by droughts of different severity and durations across Guangdong is important for scientific management of water resource and agricultural activities and also the development of social resilience under the influence of climate changes."
0,"The Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) are the new set of alternative futures of societal development that inform global and regional climate change research. They have the potential to foster the integration of socioeconomic scenarios within assessments of future climate-related health impacts. To date, such assessments have primarily superimposed climate scenarios on current socioeconomic conditions only. Until now, the few assessments of future health risks that employed the SSPs have focused on future human exposure-i.e.,mainly future population patterns-, neglecting future human vulnerability. This paper first explores the research gaps-mainly linked to the paucity of available projections-that explain such a lack of consideration of human vulnerability under the SSPs. It then highlights the need for projections of socioeconomic variables covering the wide range of determinants of human vulnerability, available at relevant spatial and temporal scales, and accounting for local specificities through sectoral and regional extended versions of the global SSPs. Finally, this paper presents two innovative methods of obtaining and computing such socioeconomic projections under the SSPs-namely the scenario matching approach and an approach based on experts' elicitation and correlation analyses-and applies them to the case of Europe. They offer a variety of possibilities for practical application, producing projections at sub-national level of various drivers of human vulnerability such as demographic and social characteristics, urbanization, state of the environment, infrastructure, health status, and living arrangements. Both the innovative approaches presented in this paper and existing methods-such as the spatial disaggregation of existing projections and the use of sectoral models-show great potential to enhance the availability of relevant projections of determinants of human vulnerability. Assessments of future climate-related health impacts should thus rely on these methods to account for future human vulnerability-under varying levels of socioeconomic development-and to explore its influence on future health risks under different degrees of climate change."
1,"Climate change can impact air quality by altering the atmospheric conditions that determine pollutant concentrations. Over large regions of the U.S., projected changes in climate are expected to favor formation of ground-level ozone and aggravate associated health effects. However, modeling studies exploring air quality-climate interactions have often overlooked the role of natural variability, a major source of uncertainty in projections. Here we use the largest ensemble simulation of climate-induced changes in air quality generated to date to assess its influence on estimates of climate change impacts on U.S. ozone. We find that natural variability can significantly alter the robustness of projections of the future climate's effect on ozone pollution. In this study, a 15year simulation length minimum is required to identify a distinct anthropogenic-forced signal. Therefore, we suggest that studies assessing air quality impacts use multidecadal simulations or initial condition ensembles. With natural variability, impacts attributable to climate may be difficult to discern before midcentury or under stabilization scenarios."
0,"Increased natural and anthropogenic stresses have threatened the Earths ability to meet growing human demands of food, energy and water (FEW) in a sustainable way. Although much progress has been made in the provision of individual component of FEW, it remains unknown whether there is an optimized strategy to balance the FEW nexus as a whole, reduce air and water pollution, and mitigate climate change on national and global scales. Increasing FEW conflicts in the agroecosystems make it an urgent need to improve our understanding and quantification of how to balance resource investment and enhance resource use efficiencies in the FEW nexus. Therefore, we propose an integrated modeling system of the FEW nexus by coupling an ecosystem model, an economic model, and a regional climate model, aiming to mimic the interactions and feedbacks within the ecosystem-human-climate systems. The trade-offs between FEW benefit and economic cost in excess resource usage, environmental degradation, and climate consequences will be quantitatively assessed, which will serve as sustainability indicators for agricultural systems (including crop production, livestock and aquaculture). We anticipate that the development and implementation of such an integrated modeling platform across worlds regions could build capabilities in understanding the agriculture-centered FEW nexus and guiding policy and land management decision making for a sustainable future."
0,"The use of species distribution models is gaining popularity in biological sciences. We used Maxent, a maximum entropy-based program, to predict distribution of Sapium sebiferum in western Himalaya. Sapium sebiferum is amongst the highly invasive species of the world and its spread in western Himalaya is a serious conservation issue. In order to model its distribution, we used field-collected coordinates of 177 presence locations of the species. Additionally, environmental data downloaded from the worldclim data portal were also used. Maxent was then run using default settings with 70% of the locations being used for training and the remaining 30% for testing the model. Area under curve for the receiving operator analyses measured at all possible threshold values training (0.993) and test (0.993) was close to 1, thereby showing the accuracy of the model."
1,"Restricting human activities through Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) is assumed to create more resilient biological communities with a greater capacity to resist and recover following climate events. Here we review the evidence linking protection from local pressures (e.g., fishing and habitat destruction) with increased resilience. Despite strong theoretical underpinnings, studies have only rarely attributed resilience responses to the recovery of food webs and habitats, and increases in the diversity of communities and populations. When detected, resistance to ocean warming and recovery after extreme events in MPAs have small effect sizes against a backdrop of natural variability. By contrast, large die-offs are well described from MPAs following climate stress events. This may be in part because protection from one set of pressures or drivers (such as fishing) can select for species that are highly sensitive to others (such as warming), creating a 'Protection Paradox'. Given that climate change is overwhelming the resilience capacity of marine ecosystems, the only primary solution is to reduce carbon emissions. High quality monitoring data in both space and time can also identify emergent resilience signals that do exist, in combination with adequate reference data to quantify the initial system state. This knowledge will allow networks of diverse protected areas to incorporate spatial refugia against climate change, and identify resilient biological components of natural systems. Sufficient spatial replication further offers insurance against losses in any given MPA, and the possibility for many weak signals of resilience to accumulate."
0,"Climate solutions relying on forest bioenergy may be in conflict with carbon sequestration and storage by forests as well as conservation of biodiversity. We quantified effects of forest-residue harvesting for bioenergy on both forest carbon balance and biodiversity in a boreal forest landscape. Through a modeling framework, we simulated forest development in four real watersheds with three scenarios: (i) with and (ii) without forest-residue harvesting and (iii) set aside to study the conservation potential of these landscapes in the future without management. We simulated changes in the forest carbon stocks and in the quality and quantity of deadwood resources for 100 years and combined this information with the information on species habitat associations based on expert judgements. In this study, current practices of slash and stump harvesting reduced forest carbon stocks and deadwood volumes at the landscape scale and, consequently, halved the emissions savings that can be obtained with bioenergy. In addition, logging-residue harvesting reduced 15%-21% of the combined species conservation capacity of the landscape for red-listed, saproxylic species compared with forest management without bioenergy harvesting. Furthermore, the results indicated a potential conflict between areas of high bioenergy potential and high conservation potential."
1,"Urban trees can help to mitigate the urban heat island through evapotranspiration. However, growing conditions in cities are heterogeneous and micrometeorological conditions in street canyons can have a large impact on a tree's transpiration. Here we investigated a common urban street tree species Tilia cordata of different ages and sizes, planted in two contrasting street canyons in a densely built neighbourhood within the centre of Munich, Germany: Bordeaux Platz, an open green square (OGS), and Pariser Platz, a circular paved square (CPS) with similar aspect ratio approximate to 0.5. The experiment was carried out during the exceptionally hot and dry summer of 2015. The open green square showed significantly higher wind speed and vapour pressure deficit but lower soil temperature, less negative soil moisture potential and also a smaller wind tunneling effect compared to the circular paved square. All these variables showed strong relationship with the sapflux density Us) of trees grown at these two sites. They explain almost 78% of the variation in Js. On average Js values of the trees at Bordeaux Platz peaked to 0.30-0.35 ml cm(-2) min(-1) during the day compared to the peak values of 0.20-0.23 ml cm(-2) min(-1) for trees at Pariser Platz. Consequently, trees grown at the open green square showed higher peak cooling of 2.3 kW tree(-1) or 82 w m(-2) than at the circular paved square (1.9 kW tree(-1)). Interestingly, nocturnal cooling was higher for trees at the circular paved square with 18% of daytime transpiration compared to 2% fortrees at the open green square. The study gave new insights into the cooling benefits of urban trees planted in open green squares compared to closed and paved squares and its temporal variation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

1,"AimCorrelative models that forecast extinction risk from climate change and invasion risks following species introductions, depend on the assumption that species' current distributions reflect their climate tolerances (climatic equilibrium'). This assumption has rarely been tested with independent distribution data, and studies that have done so have focused on species that are widespread or weedy in their native range. We use independent data to test climatic equilibrium for a broadly representative group of species, and ask whether there are any general indicators that can be used to identify when equilibrium occurs. LocationEurope and contiguous USA. MethodsWe contrasted the climate conditions occupied by 51 plant species in their native (European) and naturalized (USA) distributions by applying kernel smoothers to species' occurrence densities. We asked whether species had naturalized in climate conditions that differ from their native ranges, suggesting climatic disequilibrium in the native range, and whether characteristics of species' native distributions correspond with climatic equilibrium. ResultsA large proportion of species' naturalized distributions occurred outside the climatic conditions occupied in their native ranges: for 22 species, the majority of their naturalized ranges fell outside their native climate conditions. Our analyses revealed large areas in Europe that species do not occupy, but which match climatic conditions occupied in the USA, suggesting a high degree of climatic disequilibrium in the native range. Disequilibrium was most severe for species with native ranges that are small and occupy a narrow range of climatic conditions. Main conclusionsOur results demonstrate that the direct effects of climate on species distributions have been widely overestimated, and that previous large-scale validations of the equilibrium assumption using species' native and naturalized distributions are not generally applicable. Non-climatic range limitations are likely to be the norm, rather than the exception, and pose added risks for species under climate change."
1,"Hydrological models are useful tools for exploring the impact of climate change. To prioritize parameters for calibration and to evaluate hydrological model functioning, sensitivity analysis can be conducted. Parameter sensitivity, however, varies over climate, and therefore climate change could influence parameter sensitivity. In this study we explore the change in parameter sensitivity for the mean discharge and the timing of the discharge, within a plausible climate change rate. We investigate whether changes in sensitivity propagate into the calibration strategy and diagnostically compare three hydrological models based on the sensitivity results. We employed three frequently used hydrological models (SAC, VIC, and HBV) and explored parameter sensitivity changes across 605 catchments in the United States by comparing GCM(RCP8.5)-forced historical and future periods. Consistent among all hydrological models and both for the mean discharge and the timing of the discharge is that the sensitivity of snow parameters decreases in the future. Which other parameters increase in sensitivity is less consistent among the hydrological models. In 45% to 55% of the catchments, dependent on the hydrological model, at least one parameter changes in the future in the top-5 most sensitive parameters for mean discharge. For the timing, this varies between 40% and 88 %. This requires an adapted calibration strategy for long-term projections, for which we provide several suggestions. The disagreement among the models on the processes that become more relevant in future projections also calls for a strict evaluation of the adequacy of the model structure for long-term simulations."
1,"As global climate change progresses, soil will experience prolonged periods of both drought and heavy rainfall, leading to a more frequent drought-re-wetting process that may impact the ecosystem 's carbon (C) cycle. However, understanding the extent to which different water conditions and wet-dry cycles alter the process of soil organic carbon (SOC) mineralization remains limited. Therefore, our study focused on the dammed land unique to the Loess Plateau, silted by check dams constructed for erosion control. We implemented three water gradients-drought (30% WHC), water stress (100% WHC), and wet-dry cycling (30 -100%)-indoors to observe the SOC mineralization process five times. We identified a transient excitation effect of the wet-dry cycles on SOC mineralization. Soil mineralization decreased gradually with the alternation of wet-dry cycles. The wet-dry cycles not only significantly impacted the contents of SOC and TN but also stimulated the activities of enzymes related to C and N cycles. As the cycle frequency increased, the utilization of C sources by soil microorganisms gradually decreased, and the dominance of carbohydrates, amines, and acids evolved into a single acid, esters, or alcohols. Phosphatase and Chloroflexi were the main factors influencing SOC mineralization under drought stress, while TN and Ascomycota were the primary factors under water stress. SOC and Gemmatimonadetes were the main limiting factors for SOC mineralization under the wet-dry cycles. Additionally, we quantified the direct and interactive contributions of each factor to SOC mineralization. The direct contributions of drought stress, water stress, and the wet-dry cycles to SOC mineralization were 0.961, 0.736, and 0.942, respectively. This study contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying SOC mineralization in the Loess Plateau under changing conditions."
0,"We monitored seasonal dynamics of stem water status of four coniferous species (Abies alba, Larix decidua, Picea abies and Pinus sylvestris) planted at the Borova hora Arboretum (300 m a.s.l., Zvolen valley, Central Slovakia) beyond their ecological and production optima, in the region with warmer and drier climate compared to the sites of their origin. Species-specific stem water deficit and maximum daily shrinkage were extracted from diurnal band dendrometer records of stem circumference recorded by digital band dendrometers DRL26 installed on five trees per species, and correlations with environmental variables were analysed. The seasonal stem circumference increment of all tree species was higher in 2017 than in the drier and hotter year of 2018. The greatest seasonal stem circumference increment in the observed periods of 2017 and 2018 was observed for A. alba and P. sylvestris, respectively. The highest and lowest values of daily and seasonal stem water deficit were observed for L. decidua and A. alba, respectively. The analysis of trees' short-term response to extreme climate events seems to be the promising and suitable method for detecting tree species tolerance towards drought."
1,"Global climate change is affecting and will continue to affect ecosystems worldwide. Specifically, temperature and precipitation are both expected to shift globally, and their separate and interactive effects will likely affect ecosystems differentially depending on current temperature, precipitation regimes, and other biotic and environmental factors. It is not currently understood how the effects of increasing temperature on plant communities may depend on either precipitation or where communities lie on soil moisture gradients. Such knowledge would play a crucial role in increasing our predictive ability for future effects of climate change in different systems. To this end, we conducted a multi-factor global change experiment at two locations, differing in temperature, moisture, aspect, and plant community composition, on the same slope in the northern Mongolian steppe. The natural differences in temperature and moisture between locations served as a point of comparison for the experimental manipulations of temperature and precipitation. We conducted two separate experiments, one examining the effect of climate manipulation via open-top chambers (OTCs) across the two different slope locations, the other a factorial OTC by watering experiment at one of the two locations. By combining these experiments, we were able to assess how OTCs impact plant productivity and diversity across a natural and manipulated range of soil moisture. We found that warming effects were context dependent, with the greatest negative impacts of warming on diversity in the warmer, drier upper slope location and in the unwatered plots. Our study is an important step in understanding how global change will affect ecosystems across multiple scales and locations."
0,"BackgroundTo create a healthy nursing environment and protect human health in response to climate change, it is essential to encourage behaviour change among nurses. Although numerous studies have been conducted on nurses to address climate change, few studies have explored the relationships of factors that influence and promote nurses' climate health behavioural behavioural change, making it difficult to determine how nurses should act and prioritise regarding climate health behaviours.AimsTo investigate influential environmental factors on climate health behaviours among nurses through the causal relationships between environmental information, environmental beliefs and environmental self-efficacy using the Information-Motivation-Behavioural Skills (IMB) model.DesignA cross-sectional study.MethodsThis study recruited 186 nurses working in hospitals nationwide in July 2023. Self-reported questionnaires (Climate, Health, and Nursing Tool; National Environmental Consciousness Survey; New Ecological Paradigm Scale; Personal Efficacy Scale) were used to collect the data. Path analysis was performed.ResultsThe factors influencing nurses' climate health behaviours were environmental information, environmental beliefs and environmental self-efficacy. Environmental self-efficacy was found to be more influenced by the exogenous variables of environmental information than environmental beliefs and to be the most significant factor affecting climate health behaviours.ConclusionsIt is more important for nurses to obtain environmental information than environmental beliefs to achieve the goal of climate health behaviours. This in turn, will lead to personal self-efficacy that nurses can mitigate the climate crisis. Their strong self-efficacy affects their climate health behaviours.Implications for the ProfessionNurses should seek and draw on the appropriate environmental information related to climate health change and nurses with environmental self-efficacy become environmental nursing leaders, encouraging other health care workers to participate actively in climate health behaviours and continuously carry out the behaviours within daily life, hospital and community environments.ImpactThe study addressed the lack of relationship research on factors influencing nurses' climate health behaviours, emphasizing the importance of accessing environmental information to foster self-efficacy.

It has been evaluated geographic and meteorological conditions of droughts formation: conditions of humidity, temperature background, hydrothermal regime of soils. It has been studied the territorial distribution and probability of dry months, repetition of droughts within a season and a month, severe and ultra-severe droughts. It has been analyzed a multi-year dynamics of droughts against the background of global warming."
1,"Climate change is increasingly recognized as a major factor that may influence the recreational use of outdoor environments. Despite awareness of the pervasive effects of climate change, its effects on outdoor recreation have only recently been studied in detail. In this study we consider an economic framework that allows the modeling of the direct and indirect effects of climate change on users of recreation resources, via the impacts on natural resources upon which outdoor recreation depends. We also present a brief summary of selected empirical results bearing on climate-sensitive recreational activities. With the relatively small increases in temperature that are likely from near-term climate change, the number of people partaking in certain outdoor recreational activities-such as boating, golfing and beach recreation-is expected to increase by 14 to 36%. Numbers partaking in other activities-most notably snow sports like skiing-will likely fall. We discuss critical areas of future research that are needed to provide more detailed estimates of changes in recreation activities (along with associated economic effects) that are likely to arise from climate change in the future."
1,"We evaluated the response of vegetation's photosynthetic activity to drought conditions from 1998 to 2014 over Romania and the Republic of Moldova. The connection between vegetation stress and drought events was assessed by means of a correlation analysis between the monthly Standardized Precipitation Evaporation Index (SPEI), at several time scales, and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), as well as an assessment of the simultaneous occurrence of extremes in both indices. The analysis of the relationship between drought and vegetation was made for the growing season (from April to October of the entire period), and special attention was devoted to the severe drought event of 2000/2001, considered as the driest since 1961 for the study area. More than three quarters (77%) of the agricultural land exhibits a positive correlation between the two indices. The sensitivity of crop areas to drought is strong, as the impacts were detected from May to October, with a peak in July. On the other hand, forests were found to be less sensitive to drought, as the impacts were limited mostly to July and August. Moreover, vegetation of all land cover classes showed a dependence between the sign of the correlation and the elevation gradient. Roughly 60% (20%) of the study domain shows a concordance of anomalously low vegetation activity with dry conditions of at least 50% (80%) in August. By contrast, a lower value of concordance was observed over the Carpathian Mountains. During the severe drought event of 2000/2001, a decrease in vegetation activity was detected for most of the study area, showing a decrease lasting at least 4 months, between April and October, for more than two thirds (71%) of the study domain."
0,"The atmospheric ozone concentrations have substantially increased in the surface layer over the past decades, and consequently exhibited a strong influence on soil microbial communities and functions. However, the effect of elevated ozone (eO(3)) on the abundance, diversity, and structural complexity of soil nematode communities are elusive under different rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivars. Here, the soil nematode community was investigated in two rice cultivars (Hybrid, Shanyou 63 vs. Japonica, Wuyujing 3) under open-top chambers (OTC) with control and eO(3) conditions. The results showed that the abundance of soil nematode community was altered by eO(3), but the responses were dependent on crop cultivars. The eO(3) decreased the total abundance and simplified the network complexity of the soil nematode community for both cultivars. However, eO(3) increased the abundance of c-p 4 in Shanyou 63, rather than Wuyujing 3, indicating that the hybrid rice cultivar could tradeoff the adverse impacts of eO(3) on the functional group of soil nematodes. Similarly, bacterivores belonging to K-strategy (c-p 4) increased under eO(3) in Shanyou 63, suggesting that the soil food web formed a bacteria-dominated channel under eO(3) for the hybrid rice cultivar. This study shed new light on the critical importance of rice cultivars in shaping the impacts of eO(3) on the soil micro-food web. Therefore, breeding and biotechnological approaches may become valuable pathways to improve soil health by shaping the community structures of the soil micro-food web in response to climate change in the future."
0,"Background: There is overwhelming scientific evidence that human activities have changed and will continue to change the climate of the Earth. Eco-environmental health, which refers to the interdependencies between ecological systems and population health and well-being, is likely to be significantly influenced by climate change. The aim of this study was to examine perceptions from government stakeholders and other relevant specialists about the threat of climate change, their capacity to deal with it, and how to develop and implement a framework for assessing vulnerability of eco-environmental health to climate change. Methods: Two focus groups were conducted in Brisbane, Australia with representatives from relevant government agencies, non-governmental organisations, and the industry sector (n = 15) involved in the discussions. The participants were specialists on climate change and public health from governmental agencies, industry, and non-governmental organisations in South-East Queensland. Results: The specialists perceived climate change to be a threat to eco-environmental health and had substantial knowledge about possible implications and impacts. A range of different methods for assessing vulnerability were suggested by the participants and the complexity of assessment when dealing with multiple hazards was acknowledged. Identified factors influencing vulnerability were perceived to be of a social, physical and/or economic nature. They included population growth, the ageing population with associated declines in general health and changes in the vulnerability of particular geographical areas due to for example, increased coastal development, and financial stress. Education, inter-sectoral collaboration, emergency management (e. g. development of early warning systems), and social networks were all emphasised as a basis for adapting to climate change. To develop a framework, different approaches were discussed for assessing eco-environmental health vulnerability, including literature reviews to examine the components of vulnerability such as natural hazard risk and exposure and to investigate already existing frameworks for assessing vulnerability. Conclusion: The study has addressed some important questions in regard to government stakeholders and other specialists' views on the threat of climate change and its potential impacts on eco-environmental health. These findings may have implications in climate change and public health decision-making."
1,"Forest ecosystems are undergoing unprecedented changes in environmental conditions due to global change impacts. Modification of global biogeochemical cycles of carbon and nitrogen, and the subsequent climate change are affecting forest functions at different scales, from physiology and growth of individual trees to cycling of nutrients. This review summarizes the present knowledge regarding the impact of global change on forest functioning not only with respect to climate change, which is the focus of most studies, but also the influence of altered nitrogen cycle and the interactions among them. The carbon dioxide (CO2) fertilization effect on tree growth is expected to be constrained by nutrient imbalances resulting from high N deposition rates and the counteractive effect of increasing water deficit, which interact in a complex way. At the community level, responses to global change are modified by species interactions that may lead to competition for resources and/or relaxation due to facilitation and resource partitioning processes. Thus, some species mixtures can be more resistant to drought than their respective pure forests, albeit it depends on environmental conditions and species' functional traits. Climate change and nitrogen deposition have additional impacts on litterfall dynamics, and subsequent decomposition and nutrient mineralization processes. Elemental ratios (i.e., stoichiometry) are associated with important ecosystem traits, including trees' adaptability to stress or decomposition rates. As stoichiometry of different ecosystem components are also influenced by global change, nutrient cycling in forests will be altered too. Therefore, a re-assessment of traditional forest management is needed in order to cope with global change. Proposed silvicultural systems emphasize the key role of diversity to assure multiple ecosystem services, and special attention has been paid to mixed-species forests. Finally, a summary of the patterns and underlying mechanisms governing the relationships between diversity and different ecosystems functions, such as productivity and stability, is provided."
1,"The Mekong Delta faces significant challenges in supplying Vietnam and its export market countries with agricultural commodities, while ensuring livelihoods and providing living space to its growing population in the context of climate change and the country's agrarian transition. Anthropogenic factors, such as the construction of dykes to control river flooding, river sand mining, the further development of triple-cropping rice production, and infrastructure development, together with climate change impacts on sediment and water availability, are all combining to threaten agricultural production. One of the key challenges in sustainable development is the need to identify plausible future states of agricultural-based socio-ecological systems which draw upon differing strategies of land management, and to characterise the impacts of these systems on both the landscape and employment. It was hypothesised from the literature and rapid rural appraisals that each land system can only provide a certain number of jobs, which was further demonstrated using binomial regressions. We show that the odds of being employed are lower for intensive agricultural systems (OR=0.78 for triple rice; 0.91 for intensive aquaculture) than for diversified systems (OR=1.16 for rice-aquaculture; OR=1.63 for mixed fruit trees). Drawing from workshops with local and national stakeholders, we then used Earth observation and national census data in a spatial land use systems dynamic framework to simulate two alternative Mekong Delta futures based upon the climate pathway RCP 4.5 in combination with two existing policies (i) Resolution No. 124 (Specialisation) which promotes triple crop rice and aquaculture intensification and (ii) Resolution No. 639 (Diversification), which states that there should be a development of sustainable rice aquaculture and crop diversification. Based on the quantitative objectives of each policy, we estimated likely changes of services provided by land use systems if either policy were to dominate. The estimated impacts of each future scenario on the provision of employment ultimately indicate that policies with a diversification development paradigm will provide more employment (+0.9%) than policies with a specialisation paradigm (-46%), and that current policies have potentially conflicting consequences. Decisions driving towards intensive farming risk triggering rural unemployment and outmigration, potentially exacerbating urban poverty in major cities such as Can Tho and Ho Chi Minh City. On the other hand, decisions aiming at increasing diversified agricultural systems can help secure more job opportunities. Our results indicate that spatial planning policies should rely on a broad-based assessment of land system services that include employment and environmental impacts to ensure a just transition towards resilient and environmentally sustainable rural territories."
0,"Global environmental changes are hypothesized to affect herbivores indirectly via changes in plant defenses, and many studies have been conducted to explore effects of environmental change on plant chemistry and herbivory. We quantitatively synthesized data from these studies to produce generalities about the effects of a broad array of environmental changes on herbivores. Since conversion of natural habitat to agriculture has been one of the most profound environmental changes over the past century, the effects of global change variables on plant defense were also compared between natural and agricultural systems. We found evidence that increasing CO2, light availability, and nutrients all consistently increase herbivory, particularly by generalists. No significant differences in chemistry and herbivory response variables were found between natural and managed systems. Overall, these results are consistent with recent predictions of a disruption of natural trophic interactions with global change."
0,"The sooty bark disease (SBD) is an emerging disease affecting sycamore maple trees (Acer pseudoplatanus) in Europe. Cryptostroma corticale, the causal agent, putatively native to eastern North America, can be also pathogenic for humans causing pneumonitis. It was first detected in 1945 in Europe, with markedly increasing reports since 2000. Pathogen development appears to be linked to heat waves and drought episodes. Here, we analyse the conditions of the SBD emergence in Europe based on a three-decadal time -series data set. We also assess the suitability of aerobiological samples using a species-specific quantitative PCR assay to inform the epidemiology of C. corticale, through a regional study in France comparing two-year aerobiological and epidemiological data, and a continental study including 12 air samplers from six countries (Czechia, France, Italy, Portugal, Sweden and Switzerland). We found that an accumulated water deficit in spring and summer lower than-132 mm correlates with SBD outbreaks. Our results suggest that C. corticale is an efficient airborne pathogen which can dis-perse its conidia as far as 310 km from the site of the closest disease outbreak. Aerobiology of C. corticale followed the SBD distribution in Europe. Pathogen detection was high in countries within the host native area and with longer disease presence, such as France, Switzerland and Czech Republic, and sporadic in Italy, where the pathogen was reported just once. The pathogen was absent in samples from Portugal and Sweden, where the disease has not been reported yet. We conclude that aerobiological surveillance can inform the spatial distribution of the SBD, and contribute to early detection in pathogen-free countries."
1,"Due to the different degrees of controls exerted by biological and geochemical processes, climate changes are suggested to uncouple biogeochemical C, N and P cycles, influencing biomass accumulation, decomposition and storage in terrestrial ecosystems. However, the possible extent of such disruption in grassland ecosystems remains unclear, especially in China's steppes which have undergone rapid climate changes with increasing drought and warming predicted moving forward in these dryland ecosystems. Here, we assess how soil C-N-P stoichiometry is affected by climatic change along a 3500-km temperate climate transect in Inner Mongolia, China. Our results reveal that the soil from more arid and warmer sites are associated with lower soil organic C, total N and P. The ratios of both soil C: P and N: P decrease, but soil C: N increases with increasing aridity and temperature, indicating the predicted decreases in precipitation and warming for most of the temperate grassland region could lead to a soil C-N-P decoupling that may reduce plant growth and production in arid ecosystems. Soil pH, mainly reflecting long-term climate change in our sites, also contributes to the changing soil C-N-P stoichiometry, indicating the collective influences of climate and soil type on the shape of soil C-N-P balance."
1,"Background and Aims Southern Arabia is a global biodiversity hotspot with a high proportion of endemic desert-adapted plants. Here we examine evidence for a Pleistocene climate refugium in the southern Central Desert of Oman, and its role in driving biogeographical patterns of endemism. Methods Distribution data for seven narrow-range endemic plants were collected systematically across 195 quadrats, together with incidental and historic records. Important environmental variables relevant to arid coastal areas, including night-time fog and cloud cover, were developed for the study area. Environmental niche models using presence/absence data were built and tuned for each species, and spatial overlap was examined. Key Results A region of the Jiddat Al Arkad reported independent high model suitability for all species. Examination of environmental data across southern Oman indicates that the Jiddat Al Arkad displays a regionally unique climate with higher intra-annual stability, due in part to the influence of the southern monsoon. Despite this, the relative importance of environmental variables was highly differentiated among species, suggesting that characteristic variables such as coastal fog are not major cross-species predictors at this scale. Conclusions The co-occurrence of a high number of endemic study species within a narrow monsoon-influenced region is indicative of a refugium with low climate change velocity. Combined with climate analysis, our findings provide strong evidence for a southern Arabian Pleistocene refugium in Oman's Central Desert. We suggest that this refugium has acted as an isolated temperate and mesic island in the desert, resulting in the evolution of these narrowrange endemic flora. Based on the composition of species, this system may represent the northernmost remnant of a continuous belt of mesic vegetation formerly ranging from Africa to Asia, with close links to the flora of East Africa. This has significant implications for future conservation of endemic plants in an arid biodiversity hotspot."
0,"The Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) have recently launched themselves as the UN-sanctioned instrument for conserving nature. They seek to establish themselves as the authority in this field alongside the well-known Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in climate science. Quickly following or even before recent publication of their conceptual framework in two biology journals, they were already underway building upon it. This headlong push, we believe, is ill advised. We show how the framework is unsound as a foundation for further work-in a number of ways and perhaps even by its authors' own lights. It is therefore urgent that the IPBES thoroughly and thoughtfully reconsider their framework before too much effort is wasted."
0,"Sufficient freshwater is needed for water dependent sectors such as agriculture, nature, drinking water, and industry. However, even in low-lying, flood prone countries like the Netherlands, climate change, weather extremes, economic growth, urbanization, land subsidence and increased food production will make it more complex to guarantee sufficient freshwater for all sectors. Furthermore, the frequency and amplitude of extremely dry and wet weather conditions is expected to increase. The current Dutch water management system is not designed to anticipate these extremes. Over the last decades, drained Dutch agricultural fields, land consolidation and urbanization resulted in declining groundwater tables. Additionally, the fresh water demand of different sectors (agriculture, industry, drinking water) increased, causing an increased pressure on the regional groundwater system. As a consequence, the annual groundwater table in sandy soil areas dropped over time with the effect that, nowadays, fresh water is becoming scarce in dry periods. In this paper we provide insight in the shifting water management strategy in the Netherlands (1950-2020), with the corresponding drainage systems, developing from conventional drainage (approx. 1950-1990), to controlled drainage (1990's onwards), climate adaptive drainage (2010 onwards) and subirrigation systems (2018 onwards). Furthermore, we provide insight in the effect of subirrigation on groundwater levels and crop yields, based on both international literature and measurements of Dutch field pilots. Although subirrigation can contribute to improved soil moisture conditions for crop growth on field scale, we show that the water volume needed for subirrigation can be large and could put a significant pressure on the available regional water sources. Therefore, efficient and responsible use of the available external water sources for subirrigation (e.g. surface water, treated waste water, or groundwater) is required. Finally, the implementation of controlled drainage with subirrigation asks for correct implementation in the regional balance: it requires an integral, catchment-wide approach."
1,"The traditional station-based drought index is vulnerable because of the inadequate spatial distribution of the station, and also, it does not fully reflect large-scale, dynamic drought information. Thus, large-scale drought monitoring has been widely implemented by using remote sensing precipitation products. Compared with station data, remote sensing precipitation products have the advantages of wide coverage and dynamic, continuous data, which can effectively compensate for the deficiency in the spatial distribution of the ground stations and provide a new data source for the calculation of a drought index. In this study, the Gridded Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (GSPEI) was proposed based on a remote sensing dataset produced by the Climate Prediction Center morphing technique (CMORPH), in order to evaluate the gridded drought characteristics in the Yellow River basin (YRB) from 1998 to 2016. The optimal Ordinary Kriging interpolation method was selected to interpolate meteorological station data to the same spatial resolution as CMORPH data (8 km), in order to compare the ground-based meteorological parameters to remote sensing-based data. Additionally, the gridded drought trends were identified based on the Modified Mann-Kendall (MMK) trend test method. The results indicated that: (1) the GSPEI was suitable for drought evaluation in the YRB using CMORPH precipitation data, which were consistent with ground-based meteorological data; (2) the positive correlation between GSPEI and SPEI was high, and all the correlation coefficients (CCs) passed the significance test of = 0.05, which indicated that the GSPEI could better reflect the gridded drought characteristics of the YRB; (3) the drought severity in each season of the YRB was highest in summer, followed by spring, autumn, and winter, with an average GSPEI of -1.51, -0.09, 0.30, and 1.33, respectively; and (4) the drought showed an increasing trend on the monthly scale in March, May, August, and October, and a decreasing trend on the seasonal and annual scale."
1,"In the near future, climate change will cause enhanced frequency and/or severity of droughts in terrestrial ecosystems, including tropical forests. Drought responses by tropical trees may affect their carbon use, including production of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), with implications for carbon cycling and atmospheric chemistry that are challenging to predict. It remains unclear how metabolic adjustments by mature tropical trees in response to drought will affect their carbon fluxes associated with daytime CO2 production and VOC emission. To address this gap, we used position-specific C-13-pyruvate labeling to investigate leaf CO2 and VOC fluxes from four tropical species before and during a controlled drought in the enclosed rainforest of Biosphere 2 (B2). Overall, plants that were more drought-sensitive had greater reductions in daytime CO2 production. Although daytime CO2 production was always dominated by non-mitochondrial processes, the relative contribution of CO2 from the tricarboxylic acid cycle tended to increase under drought. A notable exception was the legume tree Clitoria fairchildiana R.A. Howard, which had less anabolic CO2 production than the other species even under pre-drought conditions, perhaps due to more efficient refixation of CO2 and anaplerotic use for amino acid synthesis. The C. fairchildiana was also the only species to allocate detectable amounts of C-13 label to VOCs and was a major source of VOCs in B2. In C. fairchildiana leaves, our data indicate that intermediates from the mevalonic acid (MVA) pathway are used to produce the volatile monoterpene trans-beta-ocimene, but not isoprene. This apparent crosstalk between the MVA and methylerythritol phosphate pathways for monoterpene synthesis declined with drought. Finally, although trans-beta-ocimene emissions increased under drought, it was increasingly sourced from stored intermediates and not de novo synthesis. Unique metabolic responses of legumes may play a disproportionate role in the overall changes in daytime CO2 and VOC fluxes in tropical forests experiencing drought."
0,"Plants face a trade-off between hydraulic safety and growth, leading to a range of water-use strategies in different species. However, little is known about such strategies in tropical trees and whether different water-use traits can acclimate to warming.We studied five water-use traits in 20 tropical tree species grown at three different altitudes in Rwanda (RwandaTREE): stomatal conductance (gs), leaf minimum conductance (gmin), plant hydraulic conductance (Kplant), leaf osmotic potential (psi o) and net defoliation during drought. We also explored the links between these traits and growth and mortality data.Late successional (LS) species had low Kplant, gs and gmin and, thus, low water loss, while low psi o helped improve leaf water status during drought. Early successional (ES) species, on the contrary, used more water during both moist and dry conditions and exhibited pronounced drought defoliation. The ES strategy was associated with lower mortality and more pronounced growth enhancement at the warmer sites compared to LS species. While Kplant and gmin showed downward acclimation in warmer climates, psi o did not acclimate and gs measured at prevailing temperature did not change.Due to distinctly different water use strategies between successional groups, ES species may be better equipped for a warmer climate as long as defoliation can bridge drought periods."
1,"Resource exploitation markedly alters land use and ecological carbon storage, posing risks to carbon sinks and food security. This study analyzes land-use change from 1990 to 2020 in the resource-based province of Shanxi, China. By introducing a mineral resource driver, the PLUS model was used to predict four scenarios: natural development (ND), cropland protection (CP), ecological protection (EP), and dual protection of ecology and cropland (DP). The spatial and temporal evolutions of carbon storage were then analyzed using the InVEST model. Forests were predominantly distributed in mountainous areas, with croplands in southerly and central flat areas, construction lands in and around cities, and mining lands sporadically distributed across Shanxi. From 1990 to 2020, croplands and grasslands decreased, while forest, construction, and mining lands increased. Carbon storage decreased continuously, with a total loss of 15.1 x 106 t. High-value carbon storage areas were in the L & uuml;liang, Taihang, and Taiyue Mountains, and low-value areas were in the more populous central and southern regions. Carbon storage was predicted to decline by 2035 under the ND and CP scenarios and to exceed that of 2020 under the EP and DP scenarios. The DP scenario projected an increase of 4.93 x 106 t in carbon storage by 2035. The DP scenario realizes the protection of carbon sinks in resource-based areas and maintains food security, providing a theoretical reference for achieving carbon neutrality and high-quality sustainable development in Shanxi Province."
0,"The aim of this paper is to analyze the interactions between the forest and local and regional climate changes on Romanian territory. This is a present-day concept which has deep roots in the past. The main roles of the forest are recognized and appreciated at a large scale. Forests provide excellent soil protection by maintaining high rates of evapotranspiration, interception and infiltration and generate only small quantities of runoff If the forest can provide resources as timber, fuel, fruits, in terms of environmental protection the forests has an important role in keeping the biodiversity, consumption of CO2 and temperatures control. The forested belt in the neighborhood of agricultural land has direct effect on leaching nutrients consumption. At the beginning of 19th century, the forests covered about 60% of Romanian territory while in present days this surface decreased to about 27%. Deforestations have an important effect on the peak values of the hydrological cycle, droughts, heavy rains and storms. As a response to these natural phenomena, the forested surface reduces continuously. This could be an ever-changing-never-ending chain which has to be broken down. Romanian people consider the forest as a valuable natural resource, as a true splendor of the country. The forests assured the survival of the first communities and numerous citadels and monasteries were built in the forest as a protective measure."
0,"The family of Columbidae, including pigeons and doves, remains understudied despite their patrimonial value and high ecological and conservation relevance. Currently, 353 extant columbid species are listed in the IUCN red list, with about 20% of them being threatened with extinction. However, there has been little effort so far to synthetize the available information on factors influencing extinction risk and the allocation of research effort among columbid species. In this context, using random forest models, the present study aims at quantitatively assessing to what extent environmental, life history and socio-political factors may drive the extinction risk of pigeons and doves and explain differences in scientific attention among species. We found that high risk of extinction in columbids is associated with small historical range, exposure to invasive alien mammals and living in isolated islands and/or at low altitudes, while the probability of population decline is associated with species body size, surrounding human density and narrow habitat breadth. We also evidenced a large disparity between species or population extinction risk and scientific interest. Indeed, most of the studies on columbids have been conducted by scientists from North America and Western Europe on their local species, whereas species from biodiversity hotspots, which are more at risk of extinction, have comparatively received little attention. This unequal acquisition of knowledge creates gaps that deserve to be filled in order to have a good appreciation of extinction risk in columbids and associated threats, through fair transnational cooperation, academic training and regional coordination in conservation-oriented research on columbids."
0,"Traditional multimodel methods for estimating future changes in precipitation intensity, duration, and frequency (IDF) curves rely on mean or median of models' IDF estimates. Such multimodel estimates are impaired by large estimation uncertainty, shadowing their efficacy in planning efforts. Here, assuming that each climate model is one representation of the underlying data generating process, i.e., the Earth system, we propose a novel extension of current methods through pooling model data: (i) evaluate performance of climate models in simulating the spatial and temporal variability of the observed annual maximum precipitation (AMP), (ii) bias-correct and pool historical and future AMP data of reasonably performing models, and (iii) compute IDF estimates in a nonstationary framework from pooled historical and future model data. Pooling enhances fitting of the extreme value distribution to the data and assumes that data from reasonably performing models represent samples from the true underlying data generating distribution. Through Monte Carlo simulations with synthetic data, we show that return periods derived from pooled data have smaller biases and lesser uncertainty than those derived from ensembles of individual model data. We apply this method to NA-CORDEX models to estimate changes in 24-h precipitation intensity-frequency (PIF) estimates over the Susquehanna watershed and Florida peninsula. Our approach identifies significant future changes at more stations compared to median-based PIF estimates. The analysis suggests that almost all stations over the Susquehanna and at least two-thirds of the stations over the Florida peninsula will observe significant increases in 24-h precipitation for 2-100-yr return periods."
1,"Fire is a major disturbance in Canadian forests. Along with fuel and ignition characteristics, climatic conditions are seen as one of the main drivers of fire regimes. Projected changes in climate are expected to significantly influence fire regimes in Canada. As fire regime greatly shapes large-scale patterns in biodiversity, carbon, and vegetation, as well as forest and fire management strategies, it becomes necessary to define regions where current and future fire regimes are homogeneous. Random Forests (RF) modeling was used to relate fire regime attributes prevailing between 1961 and 1990 in eastern Canada with climatic/fire-weather and environmental variables. Using climatic normals outputs from the Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM), we delineated current (1961-1990) and future (2011-2040, 2040-2070, 2071-2100) homogeneous fire regime (HFR) zones. Heterogeneous response of fire regime to climate changes is projected for eastern Canada with some areas (e.g., western Quebec) experiencing very small alterations while others (e.g., southeastern Ontario) are facing great shifts. Overall, models predicted a 2.2- and 2.4-fold increase in the number of fires and the annual area burned respectively mostly as a result of an increase in extreme fire-weather normals and mean drought code. As extreme fire danger would occur later in the fire season on average, the fire season would shift slightly later (5-20 days) in the summer for much of the study area while remaining relatively stable elsewhere. Although fire regime values would change significantly over time, most zone boundaries would remain relatively stable. The information resulting from HFR zonations is clearly of interest for forest and fire management agencies as it reveals zones with peculiar fire regimes that would have been hidden otherwise using predefined administrative or ecological stratifications."
1,"The dramatic temperature fluctuations spurred by climate change inhibit plant growth and threaten crop productivity. Unraveling how plants defend themselves against temperature-stress-induced cellular impairment is not only a crucial fundamental issue but is also of critical importance for agricultural sustainability and food security. Here, we review recent developments in elucidating the molecular mechanisms used by plants to sense and respond to cold and heat stress at multiple levels. We also describe the trade-off between plant growth and responses to high and low temperatures. Finally, we discuss possible strategies that could be used to engineer temperature-stress-tolerant, high-yielding crops."
1,"Meteorological observations of surface air temperature have provided fundamental data for climate change detection and attribution. However, the weather stations are unevenly distributed, and are still very sparse in remote regions. The possible sampling error is well known, but not well quantified because we are lack of the adequate and regularly distributed measurements. The high resolution of satellite land surface temperature retrieval during night time provide a nice proxy for near surface temperature as both temperatures controlled by surface longwave radiative cooling and the nocturnal temperature inversion depress land-atmosphere turbulent exchange. The sampling error of mean value and trend were assessed by comparing station point measurements (pixel of similar to 0.01 degrees) with grid (1 degrees) mean and national mean from 2001 to 2021. This method permits us to make the first assessment of under-sampling error and spatial representative error on both national mean and trend of air temperature during nighttime collected at similar to 2,400 weather stations over China. The sampling error in national mean temperature is more than 3 degrees C. The under-sampling error due to lack of observation explains two thirds and the spatial representative error due to the difference between station and grid/regional mean elevation contribute the other one third. The sampling error in trend account for one third of the national mean trend. The urban heat island effect associated with urbanization around the weather stations (spatial representative error) can explain four fifths of the sampling error in trend, which is consistent with existing studies based on air temperature collected at paired weather station. Meteorological observations provide fundamental measurements of surface air temperature. These station-based temperature records are usually processed to grid data sets considering the uneven distribution of meteorological stations. The gridding procedure represents a non-uniformly sampling. In this paper, we quantified the sampling error over China using remote sensed temperature record as proxy of near surface temperature during nighttime. The causes of sampling error both in mean value and trend were both quantified. Sampling error of mean and trend of temperature collected at weather stations at nighttime over China were investigated The sampling error in national mean temperature were found to be more than 3 degrees C due to uneven distribution of weather stations The sampling error in temperature trend account for one thirds of the national mean temperature trend due to local urbanization"
1,"Climate change is projected to negatively affect human health and nutrition. There is a growing literature on the effects of climatic changes on food availability, quantity, and agricultural production, but impacts on the nutritional content of foods has not been widely studied. The aim of this paper is to systematically characterise empirical literature exploring the effects of climatic drivers on macronutrients and micronutrients in foods causing malnutrition globally. 69 peer-reviewed empirical articles (excluding experimental and modelling studies) analysing the effect of climatic drivers on nutrients in foods were retrieved from Web of Science(TM), Scopus(R) and PubMed(R) databases (2013-2019). Publication frequency and trends, and existing evidence of the extent of nutrient change associated with variation in climate-related conditions were assessed. There is relatively limited literature on associations between climate and nutrients in foods. Where it exists, only crude proxies of climate (e.g. wet/dry season) are used, with limited interrogation of the potential causal mechanisms linking climate to nutrient content. 98% of the articles showed a change in nutrient content in relation to a seasonal or meteorological variable. Most analysed the association of nutrient changes between seasons over 1-2 years, rarely over longer periods of time. Preliminary descriptive estimates point to variation in nutrient content by meteorological variability, particularly in ocean and freshwater food sources. Robust assessment of potential climate impacts on nutrient content of foods would benefit from more precise estimation of specific causal pathways and variables that mediate climate impacts on food, going beyond seasonal or crude proxies. There is need for clear articulation of how climate change might impact nutrient content given mechanisms linking meteorological and seasonal variation with nutrients. This research highlights emerging evidence that climate change may have impacts beyond agricultural productivity by affecting food nutrient content, an understudied but potentially important pathway for climate impact on global food and nutrition security."
0,"This endeavor explores the nexus between health expenditure, consumption of renewable energy, economic growth, and the quality of the environment in 10 central European nations from 2005 to 2018 utilizing the techniques of fully generalized least square (FGLS) and generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation. The outcomes reveal the significant association between health, economic, and environmental factors with green energy utilization. The utilization of fossil fuels negatively influences the quality of the environment and boosts the risk of several diseases associated with the undernourishment and respiratory system and thus increases the death ratio. Furthermore, the utilization of operations based on renewable energy usage exerts a substantial favorable influence upon residents of Central European (CE) nations and thus helps decrease health and pollution-related expenses. So, there needs to be a collaboration among all the stakeholders so that green growth in the service and industrial sectors can be achieved."
0,"Climate change and urbanization have exacerbated concerns about urban overheating, affecting thermal comfort, heat-related mortality, and urban energy consumption, especially during heat waves. Developing climate projections that reliably describe the state of the urban climate, a complex system containing microclimate phenomena on a regional and global scale, is essential for assessing overheating impacts and evaluating mitigation strategies in current and future cli-mates. Using four essential steps for advancing our understanding of overheating and informing future studies, we review climate model projections for urban overheating impact assessments: (1) Acquisition of raw future climate data at the mesoscale through GCM-RCMs; (2) Bias correction and local reference year data generation; (3) Simulations at microscale indoors and outdoors using building performance or CFD models; (4) Evaluation of overheating based on various criteria. A methodology for selecting review articles is presented. The study highlights key future research gaps related to climate data generation, improving data reliability, and addressing climate simulation complexities indoors and outdoors. In addition, a comprehensive overheating assessment also depends upon incorporating social-economic factors into evaluations. Although we focus on urban overheating assessment, the general methodologies of future climate projections may also apply to other building performance simulations considering climate change impacts."
0,"The coastal zones face much higher risks disasters and vulnerability to natural and anthropogenic forcing because of their location in extremely high-energy and rapidly developing environment. We develop and implement an updated set of indicators of coastal vulnerability that characterise relatively low-lying coastal segments with negligible tidal range but affected by substantial storm surges driven by atmospheric factors. The study area is about 90 km long coast of Lithuania in the south-eastern Baltic Sea. The classical methods for building the coastal vulnerability index (CVI) are combined with the outcome analytical hierarchical process (AHP) based approach for incorporating experts' judgements to specify the weights of used criteria. The CVI relies mostly on geological parameters (shoreline change rate, beach width/height, underwater slope, sand bars, and beach sediments) and involves only significant wave height as the representative of direct physical drivers. The selected criteria were integrated into CVI calculation using two options: (1) all criteria contribute equally, (II) each criteria may have a different contribution. Based on the weights and scores derived using AHP vulnerability maps are prepared to highlight areas with very low, low, medium, high and very high vulnerability. CVl(w) calculation based on option II highlighted 32% of the coast being of very high to high vulnerability, 22% of moderate vulnerability and 41% of low to very low vulnerability. Although these numbers vary to some extent depending on the viewpoint, in general about 10% of the coast in the study area is under very high risk, which calls for urgent planning and protective measures.

1,"In the context of global climate change and rising sea levels, the adverse impacts of storm surges on the environment, economy, and society of affected areas are becoming increasingly significant. However, due to differences in geography, climate, and other conditions among the affected areas, a single method for assessing the risk of storm surge disasters cannot be fully applicable to all regions. To address this issue, an increasing number of new methods and models are being applied in the field of storm surge disaster risk assessment. This paper introduces representative traditional statistical methods, numerical simulation methods, and artificial intelligence-based techniques in this field. It compares these assessment methods in terms of accuracy, interpretability, and implementation difficulty. The paper emphasizes the importance of selecting appropriate assessment methods based on specific conditions and scientifically combining various methods in practice to improve the accuracy and reliability of storm surge disaster risk assessments."
1,"Heatwave effects on human health and wellbeing is a great public health concem, especially in the context of climate change. However, no universally consistent heatwave definition is available. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to assess the heatwave definitions used in the literature published up to 1st April 2015 by searching five databases (PubMed, ProQuest, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Web of Science). Random-effects models were used to pool the effects of heatwave on total and cardiorespiratory mortality by different heatwave definitions. Existing evidence suggests a significant impact of heatwave on mortality, but the magnitude of the effect estimates varies under different heatwave definitions. Heatwave-related mortality risks increased by 4% (using mean temperatures >= 95th percentile for >= 2 days as a heatwave definition), 3% (mean temperatures >= 98th percentile for >= 2 days), 7% (mean temperatures >= 99th percentile for >= 2 days) and 16% (mean temperatures >= 97th percentile for >= 5 days). Heatwave intensity plays a relatively more important role than duration in determining heatwave-related deaths. Heatwaves significantly increase mortality across the globe, but the effect estimates vary with the definition of heatwaves. City- or region-specific heat health early warning systems based on identified local heatwave definitions may be optimal for protecting and preventing people from the adverse impacts of future heatwaves.

0,"BackgroundThe National Health Service (NHS) has pledged to reach carbon net-zero by 2040. In alignment with this goal, a London hospital's anaesthesia department is actively reducing desflurane use and transitioning towards total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) as a sustainable alternative, contributing to environmentally responsible practices within the healthcare sector.MethodsWe conducted a rapid qualitative appraisal through online interviews with 17 anaesthetic practitioners to explore their perspectives regarding this climate change mitigation strategy. Data analysis was undertaken through the use of rapid appraisal sheets and a framework analysis method.ResultsParticipants highlighted the disadvantages of TIVA, including the increased effort, heightened monitoring requirements, operational challenges, and a lack of clinical confidence associated with its use. Despite these reservations, participants acknowledged TIVA's potential to reduce postoperative nausea. There were perceptions that senior staff members might resist this change due to habits and scepticism over its impact on climate change. To facilitate greater TIVA adoption, participants recommended enhanced training, the implementation of a dashboard to raise awareness of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and the presence of strong climate change leadership within the department. Participants believed that a shift to TIVA should be followed by specific measures such as addressing waste management which is crucial for GHG reduction, emphasising the perceived link between waste and emissions.ConclusionsThe evaluation examines stakeholder attitudes, perceptions, and behaviours, focusing on transitioning from desflurane to TIVA. The study highlights the importance of staff engagement, organisational support, and underscores the crucial role that healthcare practitioners and leadership play in fostering sustainability within the healthcare sector."
0,"A good understanding of the power system resilience is necessary for optimizing the investment strategies and supporting the emergency rescue, but the existing quantitative estimation results based on real outage events are still lacked due to the data limitations. Therefore, this study first establishes a unified framework to measure the power system resilience under different natural disasters, by integrating the electricity performance curve with the dynamic inoperability input-output model. Then, a database of 285 Chinese historical big power outage events caused by natural disasters is established, and the city-level power system resilience values are estimated. Finally, a benefit analysis is conducted for improving the power system resilience. Our major findings are that: (1) Electricity system recoveries quickest from hail (23.05 h), while restores slowest from snowstorm (117.31 h). (2) China's city electricity system is the most resilient to the thunderstorm, while is the least resilient to the earthquake. (3) Enhancing the power system resilience will significantly reduce the requirements for rescue resources, and the saved emergency rescue cost ranges from 0.57 million yuan to 12.08 million yuan with 1% reduction of initial inoperability."
0,"Biomass bioenergy is an essential source of energy in many parts of rural India. Studies show a large scale fuelwood extraction from the local forests has resulted in the degradation of forest structure and composition. A detailed study on fuel wood species diversity and its utilization pattern is lacking for the Indian Eastern Himalayan region. The present study aims to inventorize the fuelwood species diversity and its utilization pattern among the homegarden owners in the Terai zone of West Bengal, India. A purposive, multi-stage random sampling was followed to select 100 homegardens for data collection. A total of 41 species belonging to 35 genera and 24 families were recorded during the study. The most frequent and abundant fuel wood species were Sapindus detergens and Machilus fasciculata. The average daily fuel wood consumption per household was 5.4 kg. On an annual basis, this total amount of fuelwood was equivalent to 102 m(3) of deforested wood and, on combustion; it emitted 319 t CO2, 2.3 t CO and 1.3 t CH4. The homegardens of the study area have a great potential to ensure the year-round supply of fuelwood to the households without additional cost and act as a tool to conserve the forest ecosystem. These micro-landscapes within the agricultural or human dominated landscapes around the homestead will not only serve as corridors of biodiversity conservation through habitat connectivity but also will increase heterogeneity of forest deficient landscapes particularly in the tropics satisfying small land holder's domestic energy needs while, avoiding deforestation and thus offsetting carbon emission."
1,"The prolonged drought resulting from global warming is considered an important factor affecting West Asia's socioeconomic growth, with a significant impact on the dynamic forecasting of water supply and forest ecosystems. In such a scenario, understanding historical long-term drought changes is crucial for accurately forecasting regional drought shifts in the Hindukush region. In this study, a 517-year (1506-2022 C.E.) long tree-ring width chronology of the Himalayan Cedar (Cedrus deodara D. Don) from the eastern Hindukush has been developed. The July-September Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) has revealed a positive and significant relationship (r = 0.633, p < 0.001) with tree growth, which leads to SPEI reconstruction from AD 1626 in the Hindu Kush region. Our reconstruction model has explained 40.1% of the climate variance during the instrumental period from C.E. 1965 to 2018. Fourteen wet periods (>= 3 years) were observed before the instrumental period, specifically in C.E. 1629-1635, 1638-1658, 1666-1674, 1680-1701, 1715-1724, 1770-1776, 1794-1797, 1802-1810, 1822-1846, 1850-1857, 1872-1881, 1883-1890, 1906-1914, and 1921-1937. Similarly, twelve dry summer periods were also observed in the past 339 years, such as C.E. 1659-1665, 1675-1679, 1702-1714, 1725-1769, 1777-1793, 1798-1801, 1811-1821, 1847-1849, 1858-1871, 1891-1905, 1915-1920, and 1938-1963. Nevertheless, AD 1663 was individually the wettest (with a value of 2.13), while AD 1754 was the driest (-0.99) year. The spatial correlation analysis and its comparisons with Karakoram-Himalayan drought and precipitation reconstructions have convincingly confirmed the reliability of our SPEI reconstruction. Consequently, this reconstruction can effectively serve as a proxy for large-scale drought variability in the Hindu Kush region of northern Pakistan. Our findings strongly suggest the considerable dendrochronological potential for further climatological studies in the western Hindu Kush Mountains System."
0,"Marginality and climatic determinism are common themes in upland archaeology, particularly in northern Britain, but there is increasing evidence to challenge these assumptions, notably in the palynological record. An alternative model for land-use in a highland valley is developed using three high spatial -resolution pollen sequences from north-west Scotland. In spatial terms, land-use was shaped by the landscape but also structured to make the most productive use of the small, fragmented areas of better soil in a peat-dominated environment. Climate change alone provides an inadequate explanation for land-use dynamics. A combination of careful site selection, resource management, and social interactions buffered farmers from risks posed by upland conditions, whilst allowing the flexibility to respond to opportunities created by environmental and socio-economic change, particularly during the early Bronze Age, Bronze Age/Iron Age transition, Iron Age and 'Little Ice Age'. Implications for the perception of upland farming, for the prediction of responses to environmental risk, and for the expected character and survival of archaeological evidence for past upland and mountain-farming systems are evaluated.

1,"Worldwide, the rapid shrinking of glaciers in response to ongoing climate change is modifying the glacial meltwater contribution to hydrosystems in glacierized catchments. Determining the influence of glacial runoff to streams is therefore of critical importance to evaluate potential impact of glacier retreat on water quality and aquatic biota. This task has challenged both glacier hydrologists and ecologists over the last 20 yr due to both structural and functional complexity of the glacier-stream system interface. Here we propose quantifying the diurnal cycle amplitude of the stream-flow to determine the glacial influence in glacierized catchments. We performed water-level measurements using water pressure loggers over 10 months at 30 min time steps in 15 stream sites in 2 glacier-fed catchments in the Ecuadorian Andes (> 4000 m a.s.l.) where no perennial snow cover is observed outside the glaciers. For each stream site, we performed wavelet analyses on water-level time series, determined the scale-averaged wavelet power spectrum at 24 h scale and defined three metrics, namely the power, frequency and temporal clustering of the diurnal flow variation. The three metrics were then compared to the percentage of the glacier cover in the catchments, a metric of glacial influence widely used in the literature. As expected, we found that the diurnal variation power of glacier-fed streams decreased downstream with the addition of non-glacial tributaries. We also found that the diurnal variation power and the percentage of the glacier cover in the catchment were significantly positively correlated. Furthermore, we found that our method permits the detection of glacial signal in supposedly non-glacial sites, thereby revealing glacial meltwater resurgence. While we specifically focused on the tropical Andes in this paper, our approach to determine glacial influence may have potential applications in temperate and arctic glacierized catchments. The measure of diurnal water amplitude therefore appears as a powerful and cost-effective tool to understand the hydrological links between glaciers and hydrosystems better and assess the consequences of rapid glacier shrinking."
1,"The LIFE Beware Project addresses the problem of the increase in flooding phenomena that has been registered in Italy and many other countries due to climate change. Started in 2018, it proposes an integrated multiple approach aimed at adopting nature-based solutions (NBS) to mitigate the risk of flood and increase territorial resilience to climate change with: i) information and raising awareness activities involving multiple stakeholders at the local, national and international level; ii) participatory processes for the involvement of the local communities in the development of effective public policies to mitigate the risk of flood in the Altovicentino area ( northeastern Italy); iii) support to citizens interested in adopting sustainable water retention, infiltration and storage measures; iv) training and educational processes targeting professionals, technicians and students; v) networking and replicability activities to multiply the impact of the generated good practices and increase the sustainability of the project actions. The core element of the project is its participatory approach, made by different actions that aim at the involvement of citizens, farmers, professionals and stakeholders, together with information, diffusion, educational activities (i.e., conferences cycle and events) from primary schools to University masters, training initiatives at local, national and international level (webinars, publications). Several raising awareness and knowledge dissemination activities have been organized to boost citizens' active involvement as it is the case of the conferences' cycle, with national and international experts in climate change and resilience, the School of Common Goods to increase citizens' knowledge about the concept of common goods and reflect about the challenges faced by the territory of the Altovicentino, the set of educational activities for students and teachers to have an impact on the youngest generation and improve their knowledge and awareness about climate change, with a specific focus on the cycle of water and sustainable hydraulic management. Furthermore, through the hydraulic restoration tour, the visitors, students, schools and citizens have the opportunity to discover and visit the different measures that can be implemented to mitigate the flood risk in urban and rural areas. The project proposes a direct support to those citizens who are interested in investing in small water retention and storage measures through the creation of a help desk and the activation of a purchasing group for NBS."
0,"BackgroundVegetation plays a crucial role in the ignition, propagation, and severity of fire, and understanding the relationship between plants and fire through flammability attributes has become a useful tool that is increasingly used in studies on fire dynamics worldwide. However, in the southern cone of South America, rather few studies have systematically and specifically addressed the flammability of vegetation, and yet fewer have compared native and non-native species. Given the increasing interest in knowing the flammability characteristics of vegetation, this review aims to assess the potential differences in flammability between native and non-native plant species that inhabit the southern cone and to identify the main methodologies and experiments used to analyze vegetation flammability.ResultsTwenty-eight species were identified, 18 native to the region and 10 non-native. Additionally, 64 experimental tests were revised to evaluate plant flammability. It was found that Cryptocarya alba, Acacia dealbata, Eucalyptus globulus, and Pinus ponderosa are the species with a high flammability index. By contrast, the species Araucaria araucana, Austrocedrus chilensis, Embothrium coccineum, and Persea lingue showed low flammability. The methodologies used to evaluate vegetation flammability were highly variable, with the use of epiradiators being the most frequent.ConclusionsOur review indicates that the geographic origin of vegetation (native vs. non-native in South America) is not a decisive factor in determining species-level differences in flammability. Other relevant factors that contribute with the degree of plant flammability include fuel moisture, the morphology of the species, and its internal chemical compounds. We highlight the necessity of continuing the study of plant flammability and advance in the standardization of protocols and measurements, using uniform criteria and increasing comparative studies between species, particularly in the southern cone of South America where catastrophic wildfires are increasing."
1,"Coastal hypoxia threatens estuarine nursery habitat for juvenile demersal fishes worldwide, and is expected to intensify with climate change. This study examines the physiological tolerances of hypoxia in two ecologically and economically important flatfish species that co-occur in a highly eutrophic estuary and biodiversity hotspot on California's central coast, the Elkhorn Slough. Juveniles of English sole (Parophrys vetulus) occur less frequently in areas of the slough where dissolved oxygen (DO) <= 4.0 mg/L O2 compared to speckled sanddabs (Citharichthys stigmaeus), suggesting that English sole may be more sensitive to hypoxia. We exposed both species to an ecologically relevant, acute six-hour exposure to six DO levels ranging from ambient to severely hypoxic: 8.0, 6.0, 4.0, 3.0, 2.0, and 1.5 mg/L O2 and measured known physiological and biochemical indicators of hypoxia stress. As DO declined, metabolic rate and aerobic scope decreased for English sole, while anaerobic activity (measured by L-lactate) and ventilation rate increased for both species. Biochemical responses to hypoxia were observed only at very low DO levels (<= 4.0 mg/L O2), indicating that both species appear to have a higher tolerance for relatively short-term hypoxia than other teleost fishes. Speckled sanddabs increased ventilation rate and anaerobic activity at higher DO levels than English sole, suggesting that earlier onset of compensatory mechanisms may contribute to the greater relative hypoxia tolerance in sanddabs. Examining the link between physiological and ecological thresholds for hypoxia tolerance will help determine suitable nursery habitat areas and management targets for estuarine restoration, and aid in predictions of fishery success under eutrophication and climate change."

We provide a summary of important changes in the epidemiology of invasive fungal infections, citing examples of new emerging pathogens, expanding populations who are at-risk, and increasing antifungal resistance. We review how human activity and climate change may play a role in some of these changes. Finally, we discuss how these changes create the need for advances in fungal di-agnostics. The limitations of existing fungal diagnostic testing emphasize the critically important role of histopathology in the early recognition of fungal disease.

1,"Background: Grapevine is a major food crop that is affected by global climate change. Consistent with field studies, dehydration assays of grapevine leaves can reveal valuable information of the plant's response at physiological, transcript, and protein levels. There are well-known differences in grapevine rootstocks responses to dehydration. We used time-series transcriptomic approaches combined with network analyses to elucidate and identify important physiological processes and network hubs that responded to dehydration in three different grapevine species differing in their drought tolerance. Results: Transcriptomic analyses of the leaves of Cabernet Sauvignon, Riparia Gloire, and Ramsey were evaluated at different times during a 24-h controlled dehydration. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed that approximately 11,000 transcripts changed significantly with respect to the genotype x treatment interaction term and approximately 6000 transcripts changed significantly according to the genotype x treatment x time interaction term indicating massive differential changes in gene expression over time. Standard analyses determined substantial effects on the transcript abundance of genes involved in the metabolism and signaling of two known plant stress hormones, abscisic acid (ABA) and ethylene. ABA and ethylene signaling maps were constructed and revealed specific changes in transcript abundance that were associated with the known drought tolerance of the genotypes including genes such as VviABI5, VviABF2, VviACS2, and VviWRKY22. Weighted-gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) confirmed these results. In particular, WGCNA identified 30 different modules, some of which had highly enriched gene ontology (GO) categories for photosynthesis, phenylpropanoid metabolism, ABA and ethylene signaling. The ABA signaling transcription factors, VviABI5 and VviABF2, were highly connected hubs in two modules, one being enriched in gaseous transport and the other in ethylene signaling. VviABI5 was distinctly correlated with an early response and high expression for the drought tolerant Ramsey and with little response from the drought sensitive Riparia Gloire. These ABA signaling transcription factors were highly connected to VviSnRK1 and other gene hubs associated with sugar, ethylene and ABA signaling. Conclusion: A leaf dehydration assay provided transcriptomic evidence for differential leaf responses to dehydration between genotypes differing in their drought tolerance. WGCNA proved to be a powerful network analysis approach; it identified 30 distinct modules (networks) with highly enriched GO categories and enabled the identification of gene hubs in these modules. Some of these genes were highly connected hubs in both the ABA and ethylene signaling pathways, supporting the hypothesis that there is substantial crosstalk between the two hormone pathways. This study identifies solid gene candidates for future investigations of drought tolerance in grapevine."
0,"Breeding for drought tolerance is the most effective approach to mitigate drought effects. The prime goal of the current study was to identify potentially drought-tolerant wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) genotypes. Therefore, an extensive collection of wheat genotypes (2,100) was evaluated under two water regimes, that is water deficit (WD, 50% ETc 'crop Evapotranspiration') and well-watered (WW, 100% of ETc) across several environments in Egypt. The number of days to flowering (NDF), plant height (PH) and grain yield (GY) were recorded under both water regimes across environments. Additionally, three yield-based drought indices and water-use efficiency (WUE) were calculated for the top 30% yielding genotypes (that produced economical GY; 3.58 ton ha(-1) for WD and 7.5 ton ha(-1) for WW). The results indicated a significant effect for environments, water stress, and genotypes, as well as the second- and third-order interactions across all traits. WD significantly reduced PH, NDF, and GY by 5.0 cm, 10.6 days and 50.0%, respectively. PH, NDF and GY were highly correlated. However, the direction and magnitude of correlation under normal conditions were different from those under WD. For example, under WW conditions, late flowering and taller genotypes tended to produce higher GY. In contrast, under WD, earlier and shorter wheat genotypes tended to produce higher GY. According to the drought tolerance index (DTI), 254 genotypes were considered drought tolerance (DTI > 1). Based on WUE, DTI and GY under WD, 80 genotypes outperformed the commercially grown Egyptian cultivars. Our results implied that the evaluated collection might be a valuable source not only for drought-tolerant genotypes but also for highly yielding water-efficient genotypes under favourable conditions in Egypt and similar geographic regions."
0,"After recognizing the importance of marine and coastal resources and the use of marine space for economic growth, the European Union (EU) created and implemented a long-term Blue Economy (BE) strategy that supports the development of traditional and emerging marine and maritime sectors, aiming at the enhancement of Blue Growth (BG). However, despite the existence of a robust policy framework that supports the expansion of BE sectors at both an EU Sea Basin and state level, scholars have been sceptical as to whether the pursuit of BG adequately addresses the challenges that usually come with economic development, including those of climate change and marine biodiversity loss. Various frameworks for integrating sectoral goals with each other and with environmental goals that could facilitate the transition towards Sustainable Blue Growth (SBG) already exist and have been suggested and promoted by the European Commission, such as Ecosystem-Based Management (EBM) and Marine Spatial Planning (MSP). They require the consideration of marine ecosystems and biodiversity and their protection as one of the BE sectors to be integrated via planning and management, which in turn requires the estimation of the value of ecosystem services and the spatial implications thereof. Nonetheless, there is little evidence or real-world examples on whether and how ecosystems, and within them coastal and marine biodiversity, are actually integrated (i.e., mainstreamed) when developing sectoral policies and planning and implementing economic activities at sea at various scales, i.e., local, national, and regional, and what the necessary steps and actions are that would facilitate such mainstreaming. By seeking evidence in EU and Atlantic Arc (AA) member states' sectoral policies on marine tourism, ports and shipping, marine renewable energy, and fisheries and aquaculture (as promoted by the Atlantic Maritime Strategy and its corresponding action plans) and in the outcomes of the Interreg Atlantic Funded Research Project MOSES (aiming at valuating a Sustainable Blue Economy at the national and regional scale of the EU AA), the present article focused on understanding if and how marine biodiversity is taken into consideration by EU and AA BE and/or BG policies, strategies, and sectoral developments. tau he selected sectoral policies demonstrate a good uptake of marine-ecosystem- and biodiversity-related challenges; however, at both the EU and the AA member-state level, it is unclear whether and how marine ecosystems and biodiversity are addressed as a separate BE sector. As such, we argue why and how Marine Biodiversity Mainstreaming (MBM) could address this gap, and hence it could contribute to planning, implementing, and managing maritime economic activities towards SBG at the Sea Basin level. This is demonstrated by illustrating the central role of MBM in enabling (and being further enabled by) the above integrative frameworks (i.e., MSP and EBM) and by presenting the key elements and actions required for such facilitation."
1,"Rice is a staple crop in the Vietnam Mekong Delta (VMD) in which more than half of Vietnam's rice is produced. However, rice production in the VMD is threatened by increasing saltwater intrusion due to land subsidence and climate change induced sea level rise. Saltwater intrusion into lowland areas through the canal system or capillary rise of saline water from near surface saline water tables may result in salt accumulation in the topsoil. Therefore, it is important to disentangle the two effects and their relative importance to implement appropriate strategies for water and salinity management for adapting rice production systems of the VMD to climate change. Here, we report on the possibility of using geoelectrical methods to evaluate the potential threat of subsoil salinity to rice production. To evaluate the level of subsoil salinity, we measured soil electrical resistivity using an ARES II to a depth of 40 m in a case study comprising five locations in the VMD. Electrical resistivity measurements were calibrated to soil types, which were identified through evaluating 1 m core sections obtained by drilling down to 40 m depth. The relationship between drilling data and soil resistivity was determined by applying clustering and principal component analysis. Resistivity values smaller than 3 ohm m were clearly identified as indicative for a saline water table. The results show a direct link between the depth of the saline water table and the proximity to the sea, but not to the rice production system (single, double, or triple cropping). This study proved for the first time the applicability of the electrical resistivity tomography method for identifying groundwater tables and evaluating subsoil salinity on an agricultural field scale in the VMD."
1,"A river flow regime describes an average seasonal behaviour of flow and reflects the climatic and physiographic conditions in a basin. Differences in the regularity (stability) of the seasonal patterns reflect different dimensionality of the flow regimes, which can change subject to changes in climate conditions. The empirical orthogonal functions (EOF) approach can be used to describe the intrinsic dimension of river flow regimes and is also an adopted method for reducing the phase space in connection to climate change studies, especially in studies of nonlinear dynamic systems with preferred states. A large data set of monthly river flow for the Nordic countries has been investigated in the phase space reduced to the first few amplitude functions to trace a possible signature of climate change on the seasonal flow patterns. The probability density functions (PDF) of the weight coefficients and their possible change over time were used as an indicator of climate change. Two preferred states were identified connected to stable snowmelt-fed and rainfed flow regimes. The results indicate changes in the PDF patterns with time towards higher frequencies of rainfed regime types. The dynamics of seasonal patterns studied in terms of PDF renders it an adequate and convenient characterization, helping to avoid bias connected to flow regime classifications as well as uncertainties inferred by a modelling approach."
1,"Leakages in water distribution systems (WDSs) profoundly affect their operations, elevating water production demand and treatment and pumping costs. Moreover, they strain the energy system by increasing power requirements at pumping stations. In regions heavily reliant on hydropower, such as Brazil, there is a nuanced implication: diminishing reservoir water levels due to increased WDS flow withdrawal. This not only immediately affects hydropower generation by reducing available head but, over time, may lead to interruptions in hydropower generation. This paper investigates the water-energy nexus, specifically focusing on WDS leakages in Brazil. It begins with an overview of the current situation and future outlook, considering evolving policies to enhance WDS efficiency and also the evaluation of different climate change scenarios. A more in-depth case study explores a reservoir utilized for both energy and water production. In this context, leakage management assumes critical importance, given the various water uses within the reservoir that impact the available energy and water resources. Overall, this study offers a comprehensive perspective on the water-energy nexus within WDSs, underscoring the critical importance of leakage control and its direct and indirect consequences, particularly on energy generation capacity, the environment, and the economy."
1,"Timely and accurate large-scale mapping of the spread of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) is crucial to guarantee food security, study climate change, and monitor operational agriculture. Traditional winter wheat mapping frameworks are constrained by insufficient spatial resolution and heavy dependence on field surveys, while traditional machine learning models excessively rely on subjective judgment. Furthermore, collecting sufficient field samples covering a large area is expensive and time-consuming. In this context, an automatic label update deep learning solution is developed to produce 10-m resolution winter wheat maps using Sentinel-2 data and existing coarse-resolution (30 m) winter wheat mapping products. In particular, a label update module considering the unique phenological (seasonal) characteristics of winter wheat is designed to update labels in the training phase. The results indicate that our method yields a satisfactory classification result with an overall accuracy exceeding 92% and an F-1 score greater than 0.85 for all validation samples, even when no field survey data were used for training. In addition, a 10-m spatial resolution winter wheat map for the entire Shandong province is generated, showing a significant correlation between the computed winter wheat map and the agricultural statistical land, with correlation coefficients of 0.95 and 0.78 at the municipal and county levels, respectively. The proposed methodology can serve as a viable and promising method for high-resolution, operational agricultural monitoring over large areas."
1,"Climate-related disturbance regimes are changing rapidly with profound consequences for ecosystems. Disturbance is often perceived as detrimental to biodiversity; however, the literature is divided on how they influence each other. Disturbance events in nature are diverse, occurring across numerous interacting trophic levels and multiple spatial and temporal scales, leading to divergence between empirical and theoretical studies. The shallow Antarctic seafloor has one of the largest disturbance gradients on earth, due to iceberg scouring. Scour rates are changing rapidly along the Western Antarctic Peninsula because of climate change and with further changes predicted, the Antarctic benthos will likely undergo dramatic shifts in diversity. We investigated benthic macro and megafaunal richness across 10-100 m depth range, much of which, 40-100 m, has rarely been sampled. Macro and megafauna species richness peaked at 50-60 m depth, a depth dominated by a diverse range of sessile suspension feeders, with an intermediate level of iceberg disturbance. Our results show that a broad range of disturbance values are required to detect the predicted peak in biodiversity that is consistent with the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis, suggesting ice scour is key to maintaining high biodiversity in Antarctica's shallows."
0,"Seed science is fundamental to many fields of endeavour, from agricultural production, to restoration, and conservation of threatened species and communities. This is especially the case in Australia which has seen hugely increased involvement and outputs from seed scientists across many sectors over the last three decades. This escalation in research is reflected in the program and outcomes of the first National Seed Science Forum that was held in March 2016 and was attended by delegates representing many scientific institutions, industry, non-government organisations and volunteer groups. There were delegates from nine countries, and keynote presentations and workshops by global leaders in seed science. A key outcome of the Forum was the unique opportunity for discussion and collaboration across sectors. Another key outcome of the Forum, the Seed Science Special Issue of the Australian Journal of Botany, captures some of the emerging topical research and themes seed scientists are working on. Of particular note is the growth in germplasm conservation of native and agricultural floras, in line with, and at the forefront of, international collaborative efforts. The other strong theme across the Forum is the increasingly sophisticated use of seeds in restoration and the enabling technological advances. Future potential advances in Australian seed science are discussed."
1,"Natural disasters are causing unpredictable and devastating effects on people and their property worldwide as extreme weather events become more frequent and severe due to global climate change. Early assessment of disaster situations by relief teams can help to minimize the loss of life and property. Remote sensing satellite imagery has been used to estimate disaster losses and reduce the time and cost involved in damage assessments. However, the accuracy and performance of deep learning methods used to assess damage to buildings still leave room for improvement. In this research, we propose a novel deep learning model architecture, ASPP-Attention-ResNeSt-Unet (AARNS-Unet), to identify building areas and assess damage using remote sensing satellite images taken before and after a disaster. We evaluate the performance of our model using the public dataset provided by the X-View2 competition. Our proposed model combines ResNeSt, Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP), and Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) for better generalization. Our experiments show that the proposed model achieves a 1.3% accuracy improvement and a 7-time reduction in training time compared to other deep learning methods. Our proposed method can aid disaster relief teams in evaluating the damage to buildings and informing their response efforts. This research contributes to the development of more accurate and efficient methods for disaster assessment, which can help to reduce the negative impact of natural disasters on society."
0,"This paper presents AGRIDE-c, a conceptual model for the assessment of flood damage to crops, in favour of more comprehensive flood damage assessments. Available knowledge on damage mechanisms triggered by inundation phenomena is systematised in a usable and consistent tool, with the main strength represented by the integration of physical damage assessment into the evaluation of its economic consequences on the income of the farmers. This allows AGRIDE-c to be used to guide the flood damage assessment process in different geographical and economic contexts, as demonstrated by the example provided in this study for the Po Plain (north of Italy). The development and implementation of the model highlighted that a thorough understanding and modelling of mechanisms causing damage to crops is a powerful tool to support more effective damage mitigation strategies, both at public and at private (i.e. farmers) levels."
1,"Vegetation Fractional Cover (VFC) is an important global indicator of land cover change, land use practice and landscape, and ecosystem function. In this study, we present the Global Vegetation Fractional Cover Product (GVFCP) and explore the levels and trends in VFC across World Grassland Type (WGT) Ecoregions considering variation associated with Global Livestock Production Systems (GLPS). Long-term average levels and trends in fractional cover of photosynthetic vegetation (F-PV), non-photosynthetic vegetation (F-NPV), and bare soil (F-BS) are mapped, and variation among GLPS types within WGT Divisions and Ecoregions is explored. Analysis also focused on the savanna-woodland WGT Formations. Many WGT Divisions showed wide variation in long-term average VFC and trends in VFC across GLPS types. Results showed large areas of many ecoregions experiencing significant positive and negative trends in VFC. East Africa, Patagonia, and the Mitchell Grasslands of Australia exhibited large areas of negative trends in F-NPV and positive trends F-BS. These trends may reflect interactions between extended drought, heavy livestock utilization, expanded agriculture, and other land use changes. Compared to previous studies, explicit measurement of F-NPV revealed interesting additional information about vegetation cover and trends in many ecoregions. The Australian and Global products are available via the GEOGLAM RAPP (Group on Earth Observations Global Agricultural Monitoring Rangeland and Pasture Productivity) website, and the scientific community is encouraged to utilize the data and contribute to improved validation."
0,"The biochar is a solid residue obtained from thermolysis ( pyrolysis) of various biomass feedstock including lignocellulosic waste. The issues associated with the production and application or usage of the biochar have been dynamically developed throughout the world in recent years and the application of biochar in soils has been widely discussed as a possible and simple way to sequestrate carbon and improve soil's chemical and physical properties for better plant growth. The present paper deals with an overview of the currently available knowledge on the above subject and is widely supported by authors' own research results. The results of authors' investigation on biochar application to Polish soils indicate that addition of biochar into soils in different proportions increase the soil carbon content, pH, and plant growth. It is discussed that the biochar production would be an important component of circular bioregions' economy and a powerful tool for clean energy conversion and atmospheric carbon sink in order to counteract climate changes.

0,"This review provides a synopsis of the main findings of individual papers in the special issue Terrestrial Biodiversity in a Rapidly Changing Arctic. The special issue was developed to inform the State of the Arctic Terrestrial Biodiversity Report developed by the Circumpolar Biodiversity Monitoring Program (CBMP) of the Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna (CAFF), Arctic Council working group. Salient points about the status and trends of Arctic biodiversity and biodiversity monitoring are organized by taxonomic groups: (1) vegetation, (2) invertebrates, (3) mammals, and (4) birds. This is followed by a discussion about commonalities across the collection of papers, for example, that heterogeneity was a predominant pattern of change particularly when assessing global trends for Arctic terrestrial biodiversity. Finally, the need for a comprehensive, integrated, ecosystem-based monitoring program, coupled with targeted research projects deciphering causal patterns, is discussed."
1,"Many species are expanding their distributions to higher latitudes due to global warming. Understanding the mechanisms underlying these distribution shifts is critical for better understanding the impacts of climate changes. The climate envelope approach is widely used to model and predict species distribution shifts with changing climates. Biotic interactions between species, however, may also influence species distributions, and a better understanding of biotic interactions could improve predictions based solely on climate envelope models. Along the northern Gulf of Mexico coast, USA, subtropical black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) at the northern limit of its distribution grows sympatrically with temperate salt marsh plants in Florida, Louisiana, and Texas. In recent decades, freeze-free winters have led to an expansion of black mangrove into salt marshes. We examined how biotic interactions between black mangrove and salt marsh vegetation along the Texas coast varied across (i) a latitudinal gradient (associated with a winter-temperature gradient); (ii) the elevational gradient within each marsh (which creates different marsh habitats); and (iii) different life history stages of black mangroves (seedlings vs. juvenile trees). Each of these variables affected the strength or nature of biotic interactions between black mangrove and salt marsh vegetation: (i) Salt marsh vegetation facilitated black mangrove seedlings at their high-latitude distribution limit, but inhibited black mangrove seedlings at lower latitudes; (ii) mangroves performed well at intermediate elevations, but grew and survived poorly in high- and low-marsh habitats; and (iii) the effect of salt marsh vegetation on black mangroves switched from negative to neutral as black mangroves grew from seedlings into juvenile trees. These results indicate that the expansion of black mangroves is mediated by complex biotic interactions. A better understanding of the impacts of climate change on ecological communities requires incorporating context-dependent biotic interactions into species range models."
0,"The concept of dominance is frequently used to describe changes in rapidly reconfiguring ecosystems, but the definition of dominance can vary widely among studies. Using coral reefs as a model, we use extensive benthic composition data to explore how variability in applying dominance concepts can shape perceptions. We reveal that coral dominance is sensitive to the exclusion of key algal groups and the categorization of other benthic groups, with ramifications for detecting an ecosystem phase shift. For example, ignoring algal turf inflates the dominance of hard and soft corals in the benthic habitats underpinning reef ecosystems. We need a consensus on how dominance concepts are applied so that we can build a more comprehensive understanding of ecosystem shifts across a broad range of aquatic and terrestrial settings. For reefs, we highlight the benefits of comprehensive and inclusive surveys for evaluating and managing the altered ecosystem states that are emerging in the Anthropocene."
1,"This study analyses the environmental changes that the South Muntenia region recorded in 2021 compared to 2017. The research has taken into account several aspects related to: climate change, sustainable waste management, water resources, and atmospheric pollutants. The analysis method used was the Benchmarking Analysis, following which we identified the main indicators for which the analysed region recorded improvements or, on the contrary, deterioration in one year compared to another year of analysis. The assessment of the aspects taken into account was based on both the information collected from the Environmental Registers and the opinions of specialists from the analysed region. The findings of the analysis have implications for decision-makers at the macro-and mezzo-economic level."
1,"Tibetan Plateau is the headwater region of many major Asian rivers and very susceptive to climate change. Therefore, knowledge about climate and its spatiotemporal variability in this area is very important for ecological conservation, water resource management and social development. The aim of this study was to reconstruct and analyze the hydroclimate variation on eastern Tibetan Plateau (ETP) over many centuries and explore possible forcing factors on regional hydroclimate variability. We used 118 tree-ring chronologies from ETP to reconstruct the gridded May-July Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index for the ETP over the last millennium. The reconstruction was developed using an ensemble point-by-point reconstruction method, and a searching region method was used to locate the candidate tree-ring chronologies. The reconstructions have nicely captured the spatial and temporal features of the regional drought variation. The drought variations in south and north of 32.5A degrees N are notably different, which may be related to the divergence influence of North Atlantic Oscillation on the climate systems in the south and north, as well as differences in local climate. Spectral analysis and series comparison suggest that the drought variation in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau has been possibly influenced by solar activity on centurial and longer time scale."
1,"Climate change is likely to result in increases in the frequency or intensity of extreme weather events including floods. The International Flood Initiative (IFI), initiated in January 2005 by UNESCO and WMO and voluntary partner organizations has promoted an integrated flood management (IFM) to take advantage of floods and use of floodplains while reducing the social, environmental and economic risks. Its secretariat is located in ICHARM. The initiative objective is to support national platforms to practice evidence-based disaster risk reduction through mobilizing scientific and research networks. After its initial decade, the initiative is providing a stepping-stone for the implementation of Sendai Framework by revitalizing its activities aimed at building on the sucess of the past, while addressing existing gaps in integrated flood managemnet strategies comprising of optimal structural and nonstructural measures thereby mainstreaming disaster risk reduction and targeting sustainable development. In this context, a new mechanism try to facilitate monitoring, assessment and capacity building in the Asia Pacific region. The primary outcomes of the mechanism are demand-driven networking and related documentations of best practices for 1) hazard assessment, 2) exposure assessment, 3) vulnerability assessment and coping capacity to identify the gaps, and 4) follow-ups and monitoring of the IFM process."
0,"Entering the knowledge society and mobilizing science and technology are critical for emerging countries (ECs) to address important challenges of society and promote long-term economic growth. Natural laboratories (NLs) are geographical or geophysical singularities that provide comparative advantages and leverage to ECs for scientific research and international collaboration. Based on empirical evidence and learning experiences from five NLs in Chile, we propose the foundations of a conceptual framework for public scientific policies based on NLs and their possible implementation in ECs. Scientific research in NLs may address local, national, and global societal challenges while decentralizing scientific activities, encouraging transdisciplinary research in territories, anticipating the effects of climate change, and protecting biodiversity while promoting international partnerships and alignment with 2030 Sustainable Development Goals."
0,"The European Green Deal has set a concrete strategic plan to increase farm sustainability. At the same time, the current global challenges, due to climate change and fuels and commodity market crises, combined with the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing war in Ukraine, affect the need for quality food and necessitate the reduction of negative external effects of agricultural production, with fair remuneration for the farmers. In response, precision agriculture has great potential to contribute to sustainable development. Precision agriculture is a farming management system that provides a holistic approach to managing the spatial and temporal crop and soil variability within a field to improve the farm's performance and sustainability. However, farmers are still hesitant to adopt it. On these premises, the study aims to evaluate the impacts of precision agriculture technologies on farm economic, agronomic, and environmental management by farmers adopting (or not) these technologies, using the case study method. In detail, the work focuses on the period 2014-2022 for two farms that cultivate durum wheat in central Italy. The results suggest that the implementation of precision technologies can guarantee economic and agri-environmental efficiency. The results could serve as a basis for developing a program to start training in farms as well as to suggest policy strategies."
1,"Climate change exacerbates flooding problems due to hurricanes followed by heavy rains, particularly in sub-tropical regions. Consequently, submerged plants experience hypoxia stress which limits agronomic and horticultural crop growth and production. Hypoxia causes oxidative damage by accelerating the lipid peroxidation associated with O-2- and H2O2 levels. Additionally, hypoxia increases the accumulation of organic osmoprotectants and antioxidant activity, whereas it decreases the macronutrient (N, P, K, and Zn) uptake. This study aimed at investigating the effects of flooding-induced hypoxia stress on the growth and the physiological, biochemical, and nutritional characteristics of the hydroponically grown southern highbush blueberry (cv. Jewel) plants. In addition, the hypoxia-mitigating effects of conventional silicon (Si-C) and silicon nanoparticles (SiNPs) and their application methods (foliar vs. foliar and rootzone application) were also appraised. Both the Si-C and the SiNPs efficiently alleviated hypoxia-induced oxidative and osmotic damage to cells by enhancing the activities of the enzymatic antioxidants (ascorbate peroxidase, catalase, dehydroascorbate reductase, superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, guaiacol peroxidase, monodehydroascorbate, reductase); the non-enzymatic antioxidants (ascorbic acid and glutathione contents); and the accumulation of compatible solutes (proline and glycinebetaine) in leaves and roots. However, the SiNPs were more effective than Si-C at improving antioxidant activities and osmolytes formation. A strong negative correlation between the antioxidant activities and the lipid peroxidation rate was observed in the SiNP-treated plants under hypoxia stress. The SiNPs also regulated nutrient uptake by increasing the K, N, P, and Zn concentrations while decreasing Fe and Mn concentrations to a less toxic level. Blueberry plants treated with SiNPs responded more effectively to hypoxia stress by maintaining higher antioxidant and osmoprotectant concentrations than blueberry plants treated with Si-C. Additionally, the foliar and rootzone applications yielded better results than the foliar applications only."
0,"The process-based model FOREST-BGC calculates the flow of water, carbon and nitrogen through forest ecosystems. This model. originally developed for conifer species, has been adapted to a Mediterranean evergreen oak species: Quercus ilex. This application requires species specific parameters and modification of the model. First. we attempted to reproduce the level of drought stress experienced by the holm oak using a new relationship between soil water content and soil water potential. Second, to take into account the coppice structure of these ecosystems and the small stem diameter, we assumed that all the woody biomass was respiring. A 50-year simulation was performed for the homogeneous ecosystem at the Puechabon site, southern France. Water and carbon flows and biomass were examined for the last period. 1984-1993. Simulated values were compared with (1) measured soil water content and predawn leaf water potential from 1984 to 1986, (2) wood annual radial growth recorded since 1984, and (3) standing biomass estimated at the Puechabon site. The simulated predawn leaf water potential decreased in summer and reached -3.9 MPa in 1985. For the 1984-1993 period, mean ecosystem transpiration was 363 mm per year for a leaf area index of 2.9. The mean annual gross primary production was 1354 g C m(-2) soil. Simulated mean annual carbon allocated to aboveground wood was 85 g C m(-2) soil. In 1993, the simulated aboveground biomass of the ecosystem was 3275 g C m(-2) soil for wood and 252 g C m(-2) soil for leaves. These simulation results are in agreement with field measurements on the Puechabon site and on similar ecosystems in the Mediterranean region. They reproduced the intra-annual effects of the drought stress on holm oak. These results show that the FOREST-BGC model can be used for modeling the function and growth of Mediterranean oak coppice.

1,"Silver fir trees grown outside their natural distributional range were intensively studied in terms of their adaptability to increased late winter temperature and extreme weather events. The main questions of the study are: what is the influence of March temperature increase on tree rings and is the further introduction of silver fir outside its natural range economically justified? A total of 268 cores of silver fir were obtained from 12 sites throughout north Poland, which were located outside its natural range. Next, standard dendrochronological and dendroclimatological methods were applied. The March temperature increase was investigated using the bootstrap running correlation option with a 25-year moving window. Response function analysis revealed that the studied trees were more sensitive to winter temperature than to precipitation. Hierarchical cluster analysis identified two distinct geographical regions of fir growth. The positive effect of high March temperature is observed in both regions. Trees from the northwestern Poland region recovered from an extreme cold period in the following year, whereas trees from northeastern Poland were more sensitive, and needed an additional year for recovery. The reason for the relatively fast growth recovery in northwestern Poland is the influence of the mild Atlantic and Baltic climates."
0,"Population growth and urban expansion have led to increased demand for buildings. Optimizing the building facade design, using integrated photovoltaic (PV) shading and vertical farming (VF) can reduce building energy consumption while ensuring a partial food supply. However, the importance and prevalence of productive facades have not received significant attention. Furthermore, few studies have focused on the impact of productive facades on both indoor and outdoor environmental qualities. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the potential of integrating productive facades with residential facades in high-density cities. A typical community in Guangzhou, China was investigated. Thermal comfort, light comfort, electricity production, and crop yield were considered, and the optimal facade configuration was chosen from the established 146-model library. The integrated module can effectively improve the indoor lighting and thermal comfort of residential buildings. The module also mitigates the outdoor thermal environment to a certain extent, meeting 6.3-10.3% and 7.6-9.6% of the annual electricity and vegetable demands, respectively, in residential communities. This study can guide other densely populated cities with subtropical climates to advance the research and construction of productive facades, improving occupant comfort, reducing energy consumption, and mitigating food security and urban climate change issues."
1,"Background The prevalence of heatstroke is rising due to global warming, making it a serious but preventable condition, highlighting the urgent need for effective dissemination of relevant health education to the general public. Advances in technology have made accessing health information more convenient and rapid. In recent years, short videos have become a primary medium for delivering health education, with TikTok gaining considerable popularity among the general public. However, the quality of heatstroke-related health education content on TikTok deserves closer scrutiny.Objective This study aimed to evaluate the quality and content of heatstroke-related videos available on TikTok.Methods The present study analyzed the top 100 heatstroke-related short videos on TikTok, focusing on their characteristics, quality, and the content they conveyed. The quality of these videos was assessed using the DISCERN instrument. In addition, the completeness of the videos was assessed by examining six key aspects: disease definition, clinical manifestations, risk factors, assessment, management, and outcomes.Results The study included a total of 90 videos. The results showed that news organizations and healthcare professionals were the primary contributors to these videos, with those from news organizations receiving the most attention. In contrast, those from healthcare professionals received comparatively less engagement. Overall, the quality of the information was found to be moderately low, with the highest quality videos posted by non-profit organizations, followed by those posted by healthcare professionals. The majority of videos uploaded described the disease definition, clinical presentation, risk factors, assessment, management, and outcomes of heatstroke.Conclusion The quality of information provided in heatstroke-related short videos on TikTok is generally inadequate and requires significant improvement. In addition, such content should be subject to government review to ensure its accuracy and reliability."
1,"Y Increasing disturbance events (forest fires, windstorms, pest outbreaks) associated with climate change are creating new ecological restoration challenges. Here, we examine the utility of assisted migration in combination with naturally established nurse plants in order to improve the success of afforestation with Abies religiosa (sacred fir), the overwintering host of the Monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus). We established high-elevation assisted migration A. religiosa provenance field tests at two sites (Las Palomas and Los Ailes) in the core overwintering areas of the Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve (MBBR), central Mexico. At each site, 2-year-old seedlings were planted either in the open or under existing nurse plants. Three and a half years after planting at the Las Palomas site (5.5 years from germination), A. religiosa seedling survival was 72% under the shade of nurse plants but only 18% in open areas (without shade). At the Los Ailes site, 1 year and a half after planting in the field (3.5 years from germination), survival was 94% and 10%, respectively. There were not significant differences in seedling height increment among populations at either site. The results of our study and those published elsewhere suggest that A. religiosa benefits from shade protection of nurse plants and that population transfer 400 m upward in elevation (i.e., assisted migration) to compensate for future warmer climates does not appear to have any negative impacts on the seedlings, while potentially conferring closer alignment to future climates. If absent in planting sites, we recommend growing nurse shrub species (such as Baccharis conferta) alongside tree seedlings in forest nurseries so that these shrubs can be transplanted to the reforestation site 2 years before planting the tree seedlings."
1,"The combined effects of global climate change and increased anthropogenic use of free water are likely to cause decreases in availability and surface area of water in arid environments. Climate change and water loss are predicted to alter community dynamics, but identifying mechanisms underlying differential responses of species remains a critical conservation challenge. Bats drink in flight and rely on accessible water sources, yet the ability to access water is a function of flight maneuverability. By reducing the size of water sources (to simulate predicted water loss due to climate change/increased human use), we demonstrated species-specific responses by desert bats based on differences in morphology and flight maneuverability. Under natural conditions, less-maneuverable bats selected larger water sources while maneuverable bats exhibited no preference. When we experimentally reduced surface area, larger, less-maneuverable bats experienced a 69% decrease in the proportion of drinking attempts that were successful (p < 0.05) and increased competition with smaller, maneuverable bats. Our study illustrates how morphology can mediate access to a resource and highlights conservation implications as water becomes more limited in arid environments. Selection for differences in wing morphology and flight ability in insectivorous bats has allowed for coexistence and high species richness at a local scale. However, anticipated reductions in the sizes of water sources due to climate disruption may lead to species with less maneuverability being unable to access water efficiently and facing increased competition from more agile bats.

1,"Climate change (CC) will increase the intensity of extreme phenomena such as drought and flood in arid and semi-arid regions. This will cause the water supply of these areas to become very difficult in times of crisis. This study identifies sub-basins with high flood potential in the baseline period (1982-2005) and the future period (2025-2048) in the Hablehroud basin, north-central Iran. It uses the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) and 23 coupled model intercomparison project 5 (CMIP5) general circulation models (GCMs). It estimates the instantaneous peak flow (IPF) and uses a flood index (FI) to determine the contributions of each sub-basin to the floods. The rainfall of the basin will increase by 11.5% under representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4.5 and 12.6% under RCP 8.5. The minimum daily temperature (Tmin) of the basin will increase by 0.8 degrees C under RCP 4.5 and 1.1 degrees C under RCP 8.5 in the future period. In addition, the maximum daily temperature (Tmax) will rise by 1 degrees C under RCP 4.5 and 1.2 degrees C under RCP 8.5. Moreover, basin runoff will increase by 6.4% under RCP 4.5 and 11.6% under RCP 8.5. The results indicate that the central and southern sub-basins made the most significant contribution to floods in the baseline period, while the eastern sub-basins will make the most considerable contribution to future floods."
0,"Indigenous plants are an important component of the traditional food and health systems of rural and tribal communities in tropical regions. However, they do not attract much attention from researchers or in commercial markets. The present study investigated 42 indigenous, under-utilized vegetable plants from the Andaman and Nicobar Islands of India for their food and ecological values. Predominantly, the plants belonged in the Cucurbitaceae, Amaranthaceae, Moraceae and Plantaginaceae families. Fifty seven percent of the vegetables were observed in home gardens and 21.4% were collected from wild habitats. Most of the indigenous vegetables were perennials (71.4%), and included trees, vines and shrubs. Commercial farmers grew mostly exotic vegetables, while many indigenous and under-utilized vegetables were preferred by tribal and local communities. Herbs with good flavour, taste and crispness were preferred in culinary preparations; vegetables with a bitter taste and unique flavour were considered best for health purposes. The indigenous and under-utilized vegetables contained a wide range of nutrients, including Ca, Fe, polyphenols, carotenoids, ascorbic acid and chlorophyll, although they also often contained anti-nutrients including nitrate, phytate, oxalate and saponins. Our findings support the greater use of indigenous underutilized vegetables as promising and locally accepted options to address micronutrient deficiencies among households in geographically challenged regions such as the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The study also underlined the need to devise strategies for the promotion of these nutrient-rich indigenous foods to improve the nutrition and livelihoods of vulnerable communities."
1,"As one of the most densely populated and economically developed regions in China, Yangtze River Delta (YRD) has confronted with substantial land cover change (LCC) over the past several decades. This study investigates the impact of climate change and LCC on carbon dynamics in the YRD region for 1990-2019, taking advantage of a high-resolution vegetation model and two well-established LCC data in China. Simulated gross primary productivity increases from 0.52 +/- 0.02 Pg[C] yr-1 in the 1990s to 0.57 +/- 0.01 Pg[C] yr-1 in the 2010s with the major contribution by CO2 fertilization effect. The regional carbon sink, measured as net biospheric productivity (NBP), peaks at 0.03 Pg[C] yr-1 in the 2000s but remains stable or slightly decreases in the 2010s depending on the LCC datasets. Forests act as the main contributors to the enhancement of the regional carbon sink, with negative contributions from the loss of shrubland and grassland. The stable NBP during 2000-2019 suggests a potential slowdown in the efficacy of carbon sink as forests mature. While forest expansion significantly promotes NBP, the carbon released during the replacement of other vegetation types suggests that afforestation efforts need to be complemented with associated supportive measures to prevent newly forested areas from becoming net carbon sources."
1,"The Early to Mid-Holocene experienced marked climate change over the northern hemisphere mid-latitudes in response to changing insolation and declining ice volume. Oxygen isotopes from lake sediments provide a valuable climate proxy, encoding information regarding temperature, hydroclimate and moisture source. We present oxygen-isotope records from two lakes in western Ireland that are strongly influenced by the North Atlantic. Excellent replication between the records suggests they reflect regional, not local, influences. Carbonate oxygen-isotope values peaked at the start of the Holocene, between 11.2 and 11.1 cal ka bp, and then decreased markedly until 6 cal ka bp at both sites. Palaeoecological evidence supports only modest change in temperature or hydroclimate during this interval and we therefore explain the decrease primarily by a reduction in the oxygen-isotope composition of precipitation (delta O-18(ppt)). We show a similar decrease in delta O-18 values in a forward model of carbonate isotopes between 12-11 and 6-5 cal ka bp. However, the inferred reduction in delta O-18(ppt) between the Early and Mid-Holocene in the model is mainly linked to a decrease in the delta O-18 of the ocean source water from ice sheet melting whereas the lake carbonate isotope records are more consistent with changes in the transport pathway of moisture associated with atmospheric circulation change as the dominant cause."
0,"Although importance of high-yielding maize system for food security has been extensively studied and discussed worldwide, more must be done in the context of improving yield while simultaneously reducing agricultural environmental costs to achieve sustainable intensification (SI). Using China's maize production as an example, we discussed the system with equal emphasis on high yield and high nitrogen (N) use efficiency in regards to SI. Through yield potentials and gaps analysis with the help of crop modeling, the high-yielding maize system was designed and developed to make maximum use of solar energy and growing season with favorable temperatures via genetics x environment x management (G x E x M) interactions. In this high-yielding system compared with the low-yielding traditional farmers system, total dry matter increased with stable harvest index, aboveground plant N uptake requirement per grain yield deceased largely, and the percentage of the dry matter and N accumulation during the middle-late growing season increased significantly. Accordingly, an in-season root-zone N management was developed for high-yielding maize system to match the total N requirement by crop in application amount, placement, and timing for non-limiting N supply with minimum losses to the environment. The high-yielding system showed great potential for SI which reduced N2O and other greenhouse gas emission intensity by 10%-30%. Moreover, we suggest future research direction for high-yielding maize system to address multiply challenges in a changing world including climate change, resource depletion and shortage, and soil constrains and degradation to ensure food security."
1,"Based on diatom, aquatic pollen and non-pollen palynomorph (NPP), lake sediment microfacies, and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analyses we define three main phases of lake basin development including a marshy phase (ca. 16,600-9400 cal. yr BP), lagoon phase (ca. 9400-5900 cal. yr BP) and freshwater lake phase (since ca. 5900 cal. yr BP). Marine influence on the lake system linked to global sea-level rise and the Holocene marine transgression reached a maximum between ca. 8000 and 6000 cal. yr BP. An increase of Aulacoseira subarctica at 5530 cal. yr BP marks the end of the Holocene Thermal Optimum (i.e. onset of Middle Holocene cooling) in the study region. Our results further suggest that freshwater Lake Kushu had a significant effect on the initial habitation of Rebun Island by sedentary hunter-gatherer populations. The reconstructed onset of stable freshwater conditions (ca. 5100 cal. yr BP) coincided with the appearance of the earliest permanent settlements during the Middle Jomon culture phase (ca. 5000-4000 cal.yr BP). On the other hand, there is evidence for human-induced changes in the limnological conditions. This includes enhanced sediment and nutrient input into Lake Kushu resulting in high eutrophication levels that caused strongly reduced diatom productivity and enhanced green algae growth, which can be attributed to human activities apparently associated with the Okhotsk (ca. 1450-950 cal.yr BP) and Classic Ainu (ca. 350-100 cal.yr BP) culture periods."
0,"The goal of this study was to evaluate the impact of a two-quarter freshman course series entitled Food: A Lens for Environment and Sustainability (Food cluster) on the carbon footprint of food choices by college freshmen attending a large public university in California. Students enrolled in the course completed a baseline questionnaire about their diets in early fall quarter and then again at follow-up, about 6months later at the end of the winter quarter. The control group consisted of freshmen enrolled in a different course series entitled Evolution of the Cosmos and Life (Cosmos cluster). The instruction in the Food cluster included lecture material on general environmental science and life cycle analyses of food, an analysis of a reading comparing the environmental footprint of various types of meats, and classroom exercises to calculate the environmental footprint of typical foods. The Cosmos cluster instruction included climate change, but no information about food. While the two groups were statistically indistinguishable at baseline, throughout the period of the study, Food cluster students decreased (a) their overall dietary carbon footprint for a 2000-kcal normalized diet by 7% (p=0.062), (b) the beef component of their dietary carbon footprint by 19% (p=0.024), and (c) their reported ruminant consumption by 28% (p<0.001). At follow-up, the overall dietary footprints for Food cluster students were 4153 and 5726g CO2-eq/day for female and male students, respectively, compared to 4943 and 6958g CO2-eq/day for female and male Cosmos students. In the Food cluster, both genders decreased their reported ruminant meat consumption by about a serving per week, while reported ruminant meat consumption increased for males in the control group. Modest, voluntary dietary changes such as those observed in this study could play an important role in mitigating climate change. Extrapolated across the entire US population, the difference in dietary carbon footprint observed between the Food cluster and control group would amount to 33% of the reduction required for the 2013 President's Climate Action Plan (2013)."
1,"Tropospheric ozone (O-3) is a global air pollutant that causes billions of dollars in lost plant productivity annually. It is an important anthropogenic greenhouse gas, and as a secondary air pollutant, it is present at high concentrations in rural areas far from industrial sources. It also reduces plant productivity by entering leaves through the stomata, generating other reactive oxygen species and causing oxidative stress, which in turn decreases photosynthesis, plant growth, and biomass accumulation. The deposition of O-3 into vegetation through stomata is an important sink for tropospheric O-3 , but this sink is modified by other aspects of environmental change, including rising atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, rising temperature, altered precipitation, and nitrogen availability. We review the atmospheric chemistry governing tropospheric O-3 mass balance, the effects of O-3 on stomatal conductance and net primary productivity, and implications for agriculture, carbon sequestration, and climate change."
0,"Wetland plants form blue carbon ecosystems, which are key for climate change mitigation yet threatened by multiple local and global stresses. The capacity of blue carbon ecosystems to store large amounts of carbon relies on ecological processes, many of them regulated by plant traits that are shaped by the stress that plants encounter.This manuscript provides a perspective to investigate the effects of stress on carbon storage and sequestration capacity of blue carbon ecosystems based on the plant traits.A first step was to identify the biochemical, physiological, morphological and growth and development traits involved in the processes controlling carbon storage and sequestration in blue carbon ecosystems.Second, the existing knowledge on the stress effects on blue carbon processes and ecosystems was evaluated.Finally, the application of the trait-based approach to understand and predict carbon dynamics in blue carbon ecosystems under different stresses' feedback was discussed.The conclusions provide key recommendations for a trait-based approach in which the trinomial local and global stresses, plant traits and blue carbon are embraced together to identify the feedbacks between them, along with specific attention to the plant traits across the seascape, the stress interactions and the need of plant trait standardization."
0,"Production of liquid biofuels, such as bioethanol, has been advocated as a sustainable option to tackle the problems associated with rising crude oil prices, global warming and diminishing petroleum reserves. Second-generation bioethanol is produced from lignocellulosic feedstock by its saccharification, followed by microbial fermentation and product recovery. Agricultural residues generated as wastes during or after processing of agricultural crops are one of such renewable and lignocellulose-rich biomass resources available in huge amounts for bioethanol production. These agricultural residues are converted to bioethanol in several steps which are described here. This review enlightens various steps involved in production of the second-generation bioethanol. Mechanisms and recent advances in pretreatment, cellulases production and second-generation ethanol production processes are described here."
0,"Office buildings require a significant amount of energy for heating and cooling purposes. A possible strategy for reducing this energy in order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and operational costs is to specify high-performance facades. However, their benefits remain unclear for UK conditions with mild winters and cool summers. This paper reports on an investigation on the energy demand of offices in London, UK, incorporating facades with U-values between 1.2 and 2.6 W/(m(2)K) and g-values between 0.3 and 0.5 using the dynamic simulation tool Tas. Other variables considered included climate change (using the Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers' future weather data files), low internal gains, long working hours and office orientation. It was found that, apart from the case when internal gains are low, cooling is overwhelmingly necessary and energy usage increases with decreasing U-value and decreases with decreasing g-value. Low-U-value facades act to reduce conduction heat losses, thereby increasing energy use. Conversely, low-g-value facades act to reduce solar heat gains, thereby reducing the energy required for cooling. The results are used to highlight deficiencies in The Building Regulations 2010 and where more advice would be of benefit. The paper also discusses the merits of a number of strategies for reducing energy use in office buildings."
0,"The increasing anthropogenic pressure on natural environments results in impacts that affect tropical forest areas and their biodiversity [1, 2]. Adverse impacts on terrestrial and oceanic environments often compound in the intertidal area, where mangrove forest ecosystems thrive. In tropical coastal areas of many developing countries where people depend on wood and other mangrove forest products and services, forest degradation leads to socioeconomic problems. At the same time, increasing freshwater needs in these areas are expected to cause additional problems [3-5]. On the basis of remote sensing and ground truthing complemented by colonial archival material from the Dutch East India Company (1602-1800), we report that changes to the historic system of inland freshwater management have increased dramatically in recent times. Hydrological changes, such as interbasin transfers, have resulted in a qualitative ecological and socioeconomic degradation in three coastal lagoons in southern Sri Lanka. Variations in river hydrology have caused changes in the areas suitable as mangrove habitat and, thus, have resulted in an altered distribution. However, increases in mangrove area can mask the degradation of the site in terms of floristic composition, significance of the species, and biodiversity (this effect is termed cryptic ecological degradation). It is important that such changes be carefully monitored to ensure biological and socioeconomic sustainability."
0,"Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) are emerging technologies expected to bring important environmental, social, and economic improvements in transportation systems. Given their implications in terms of air quality and sustainable and safer movement of goods, heavy-duty trucks (HDTs), carrying the majority of U.S. freight, are considered an ideal domain for the application of CAV technology. An input-output (IO) model is developed based on the Eora database-a detailed IO database that consists of national IO tables, covering almost the entire global economy. Using the Eora-based IO model, this study quantifies and assesses the environmental, economic, and social impacts of automated diesel and battery electric HDTs based on 20 macro-level indicators. The life cycle sustainability performances of these HDTs are then compared to that of a conventional diesel HDT. The study finds an automated diesel HDT to cause 18% more fatalities than an automated electric HDT. The global warming potential (GWP) of automated diesel HDTs is estimated to be 4.7 thousand metric tons CO2-eq. higher than that of automated electric HDTs. The health impact costs resulting from an automated diesel HDT are two times higher than that of an automated electric HDT. Overall, the results also show that automation brings important improvements to the selected sustainability indicators of HDTs such as global warming potential, life cycle cost, GDP, decrease in import, and increase in income. The findings also show that there are significant trade-offs particularly between mineral and fossil resource losses and environmental gains, which are likely to complicate decision-making processes regarding the further development and commercialization of the technology."
0,"The energy intensity of modern food systems represents a major issue in a scenario of decreasing oil resources and increasing population. Beside the use of renewable energy, an increased efficiency in food systems could contribute to reduce fossil fuels dependence. In this sense, food losses and waste (FLW) have crucial consequences on the energy balance. Based on the concept of embodied energy, food wastage can be framed as a double waste of energy, both in terms of non-consumed food energy and the inputs used for production. Secondary data regarding direct and indirect energy inputs and FLW have been collected for the Italian food chain to estimate the embodied energy of food waste. Since in 2011 the production and distribution of food implied the use of 822 PJ and 18 Mt of food was discarded, 67 PJ of food energy and 100 PJ of embodied energy were wasted. These figures are equivalent to 12.2% of the total nutritional energy output and to 1.3% of the final energy use in Italy, respectively. The concept of double energy waste sheds new light on the intertwined relationship between energy and food security, suggesting that appropriate food waste reduction policies could result in a higher food production level and relevant energy savings."
0,"The unambiguous detection of a uniform sea level acceleration at a tide gauge station is important under an increasingly warmer Earth for the long-term coastal risk assessments. Although the timescales needed for detecting mean sea level trends at tide gauges were well investigated in the past, very few studies addressed the same issue for the sea level accelerations in depth. In this study, we demonstrate that the ability to discern a uniform sea level acceleration at a tide gauge station depends on its magnitude, systematic and random sea level variations, the degree of autocorrelation of the random variations, the length of its historical record and the desired statistical significance level of its estimate. We offer a formulary to estimate the required minimum record lengths needed to detect a statistically significant prospective uniform acceleration at a coastal or Island tide gauge station based on the retrospective analyses of its sea level record. To demonstrate its effectiveness, the minimum record lengths required to detect statistically significant prospective uniform accelerations were calculated at 19 globally distributed tide gauge stations with long records."
0,"The drivers of species diversification and persistence are of great interest to current biogeography, especially in those global biodiversity hotspots' harbouring most of Earth's animal and plant life. Classical multispecies biogeographical work has yielded fascinating insights into broad-scale patterns of diversification, and DNA-based intraspecific phylogeographical studies have started to complement this picture at much finer temporal and spatial scales. The advent of novel next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies provides the opportunity to greatly scale up the numbers of individuals, populations and species sampled, potentially merging intraspecific and interspecific approaches to biogeographical inference. Here, we outline these prospects and issues by using the example of an undisputed hotspot, the Cape of southern Africa. We outline the current state of knowledge on the biogeography of species diversification within the Cape, review the literature for phylogeographical evidence of its likely drivers and mechanisms, and suggest possible ways forward based on NGS approaches. We demonstrate the potential of these methods and current bioinformatic issues with the help of restriction-site-associated DNA (RAD) sequencing data for three highly divergent species of the Restionaceae, an important plant radiation in the Cape. A thorough understanding of the mechanisms that facilitate species diversification and persistence in spatially structured, species-rich environments will require the adoption of novel genomic and bioinformatic tools in biogeographical studies."
0,"This paper develops multiple-pollutant marginal abatement cost curve analysis to identify an optimal set of greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation measures considering the trade-offs and synergies with other environmental pollutants. The analysis is applied to UK agriculture, a sector expected to make a contribution to the national GHG mitigation effort. Previous analyses using marginal abatement cost curves (MACCs) have determined the sector's GHG abatement potential based on the cost-effectiveness of a variety of technically feasible mitigation measures. Most of these measures have external effects on other pollution loads arising from agricultural activities. Here the monetary values of four of the most important impacts to water and air (specifically ammonia, nitrate, phosphorous and sediment) are included in the cost-effectiveness analysis. The resulting multiple-pollutant marginal abatement cost curve (MP MACC) informs the design of sustainable climate change policies by showing how the MP MACC for the UK agriculture can differ from the GHG MACC. The analysis also highlights research gaps, and suggests a need to understand the wider environmental effects of GHG mitigation options and to reduce the uncertainty in pollutant damage cost estimates.

1,"Low-lying coastal urban areas are vulnerable to frequent and chronic flooding due to population growth, urbanization, and accelerated sea level rise originating from climate change. This paper is part one of a 2 paper series, however a detailed literature review on the concept and the technical aspects of both papers is presented. In the 2nd paper, the application of the concepts and the proposed methodology are utilized to set the mitigation strategies for quantification of reliability attributes. The case study is the Hunts Point wastewater treatment plant and its sewershed in Bronx, New York City. The suitability of two major rainfall stations of Central Park and LaGuardia airport in the vicinity of the case study is tested. The copula-based non-stationary 100-year flood frequency analysis of rainfall and storm surge is analyzed to obtain the design values of surge and rainfall. A differential evaluation Markov Chain with Bayesian interface is used in this paper for parameter estimation. In this study, the likelihood of joint probability of co-occurring heavy rainfall and storm surge is determined to illustrate the risk of joint events. Therefore, the copula-based non-stationary 100-year flood frequency analysis of rainfall and storm surge are performed to obtain the design values of surge and rainfall. A multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach that incorporates the load-resistance concept is presented in Part 2 paper to assess the Margin of Safety flood reliability of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). The framework presented in this paper is applicable to other coastal sewersheds."
0,"Cities worldwide have sought to improve their environmental quality through the enhancement of their green space. It seems apparent that if these green spaces are to flourish then there is a critical need to understand and describe the beneficial relationships that exist between plants, people, and places and so develop an appropriate paradigm that leads to sustainable green space. The paradigm needs to be a dynamic entity, ever shifting due to changes in the environmental, social, economical, lifestyle and demographic drivers. In recent years these drivers have become more crucial with unprecedented urban growth and the need to adapt to the agents of climate change. Such a paradigm reinforces the fact that horticulturists, economists, ecologists, planners, social and health scientists need to retain closer linkages among their disciplines and how the effects of such a paradigm can influence food production, biodiversity, behaviour, health and well-being as well as human survival. We explore three key dimensions of the concept that make it both complex and broadly useful-its basic definition, the benefits and outcomes that accrue from such a relationship and the factors that would influence a paradigm shift towards sustainable green space."
0,"Background Introducing students to the planetary health lenses perspective is crucial. Comprehensive strategies for teaching this perspective are lacking, especially in the domains of interconnection within nature (IWN) and systems thinking/complexity. There is also a scarcity of studies assessing medical students' opinions on planetary health and evaluating teaching strategies. Objective To understand Brazilian medical students' perceptions and knowledge of planetary health (PH) and evaluate the application of the educational material Patient and Clinic through the Lens of Planetary Health, which addresses IWN and complexity through the sociological lens of Actor-Network Theory, in an integrative course at a medical school in Brazil. Methods A mixed-methods, quasi-experimental design involving two medical student classes during 2022/2023. Participants completed a questionnaire on sociodemographic data; pre- and post-intervention closed-ended questions about perceptions related to PH, and an open-ended questionnaire on experience and learning. Each student group presented a portfolio under the planetary health lenses regarding a real patient, developing a network diagram that described the social network involving both human and non-human actors with which this person is interconnected. The cohorts participated in IWN activities: a contemplative trail or reflection on belonging to the planet. Results Ninety-six students and 9 professors participated. The majority of students (66.7%) reported significant or extremely significant learning from the sessions. There was an increase in perception of the need for physicians to incorporate PH into their clinical practice (p = 0.002; r = 0.46) and an intensification of the sense of interconnection with the environment (p = 0.003; r = 0.46). There was a gain in knowledge about how many diseases were related to PH (p < 0.02 for all 13 listed diseases). The majority (83%) found the sessions relevant or highly relevant and commented on their impact, both professionally and personally. Conclusions Teaching PH in a medical school allowed students to learn from the patient's perspective, considering psychosocial and environmental determinants, about the intrinsic interdependence between population's health and PH. This strategy made a significant contribution by proposing pioneering didactics and offering valuable insights into the challenges and nuances of teaching PH."
1,"Oak woodlands in the Mediterranean basin have been traditionally converted into agro-silvo-pastoral systems and exemplified sustainable land use in Europe. In Portugal, in line with the trend of other European countries, profound changes in management options during the twentieth century have led to landscape simplification. Landscapes are dynamic and the knowledge of future management planning combining biological conservation and soil productivity is needed, especially under the actual scenarios of drought and increasing evidence of heavy oak mortality. We examined the ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal community associated with cork oak in managed oak woodlands (called montado) under different land use practices, during summer. ECM fungal richness and abundance were assessed in 15 stands established in nine montados located in the Alentejo region (southern Portugal), using morphotyping and ITS rDNA analysis. Parameters related to the montados landscape characteristics, land use history over the last 25 years, climatic and edaphic conditions were taken into account. Fifty-five ECM fungal taxa corresponding to the most abundant fungal symbionts were distinguished on cork oak roots. Cenococcum geophilum and the families Russulaceae and Thelephoraceae explained 56% of the whole ECM fungal community; other groups were represented among the community: Cortinariaceae, Boletaceae, Amanita, Genea, Pisolithus, Scleroderma, and Tuber. There were pronounced differences in ECM fungal community structure among the 15 montados stands: C. geophilum was the only species common to all stands, tomentelloid and russuloid species were detected in 87-93% of the stands, Cortinariaceae was detected in 60% of the stands, and the other groups were more unequally distributed. Ordination analysis revealed that ECM fungal richness was positively correlated with the silvo-pastoral exploitation regime and low mortality of cork oak, while ECM fungal abundance was positively correlated with extensive agro-silvo-pastoral exploitation under a traditional 9-year rotation cultivation system and recent soil tillage. The effects of land use on the ECM fungal community and its implications in different scenarios of landscape management options, oak mortality, and global warming are discussed."
1,"Genetic diversity is one of the most important criteria to identify unique populations for conservation purposes. In this study we analyze the genetic population structure of the endangered montane mayfly Ameletus inopinatus in its European range. The species is restricted to unpolluted cold-water streams, and exhibits an insular distribution across highlands of Central Europe and a more continuous distribution across Fennoscandia and Northern Euro-Siberia. We genotyped 389 individuals from 31 populations for eight highly polymorphic microsatellite loci to investigate genetic diversity and population structure within and among European mountain ranges. Genetic diversity of A. inopinatus decreases along an east-west gradient in Central Europe and along a north-south gradient in Fennoscandia, respectively. Centres of exceptionally high genetic diversity are located in the Eastern Alps (Andertal Moor, Austria), the High Tatra, the Beskides, the Sudety Mountains and the Eastern German Highlands. Species distribution modelling for 2080 projects major regional habitat loss, particularly in Central Europe mountain ranges. By relating these range shifts to our population genetic results, we identify conservation units primarily in Eastern Europe, that if preserved would maintain high levels of the present-day genetic diversity and continue to provide long-term suitable habitat under future climate warming scenarios."
1,"Agriculture in the dryland region of the Inland Pacific Northwest (IPNW, including northern Idaho, eastern Washington and northern Oregon) is typically characterized based on annual rainfall and associated distribution of cropping systems that have evolved in response to biophysical and socio-economic factors. Three agro-ecological classes (AEC) have been proposed for the region: (a) crop/fallow (CF), (b) annual crop/fallow transition (CCF), and (c) continuous cropping (CC). AECs attempt to associate land use into relatively homogeneous areas that result in common production systems. Although there is an interest in sustainable intensification of cropping systems (e.g., reduction of fallow), the question remains whether climate change will preclude intensification or shift the borders of existing AECs toward greater fallow utilization. A simulation study was conducted to address this question, with the aim of classifying 4 x 4 km pixels throughout the region into one of the three AECs for baseline (1979-2010) and future periods (2030s, 2015-2045; 2050s, 2035-2065; 2070s, 2055-2085). Baseline data were derived from traditional rotations and historical climate records. Data for future projections were derived from atmospheric CO2 concentration considering daily weather downloaded from 12 global circulation models and 2 representative concentration pathways (RCP 4.5 and 8.5). Due to the direct effect of atmospheric CO2 on photosynthesis and stomatal conductance, the transpiration use efficiency of crops (TUE; g above-ground biomass kg water(-1)) showed an increasing trend, with winter wheat TUE changing from 4.76 in the historical period to 6.17 and 7.08 g kg(-1) in 2070s, depending on AEC. Compared to the baseline, total grain yield by the 2070s in the region was projected to increase in the range of 18-48% (RCP 4.5) and 30-65% (RCP 8.5), depending on AEC. As a consequence of these changes, compared to the historical baseline period, the future fraction of the area classified as CF decreased from 50% to 39-36%, CC increased from 16% to 24-28%, and CCF decreased slightly (similar to 1%), with the greater change projected for the RCP 8.5 scenario."
0,"To remain within the limits of the planetary boundaries and address increasing disease rates due to poor eating habits, there needs to be a major shift in dietary patterns. The composition of an optimal diet changes depending on location, season, and personalized dietary needs. We develop a methodology to build a 500+ food item, nutrient, and environmental impact database specific to a given country and month, which includes several life cycle stages of a food item and calculates impacts depending on from where the item is sourced. This database is then used to develop a detailed and personalized, healthful, low impact diet by using linear optimization. We applied this methodology to several case studies to compare what low impact diets would look like depending on country (Switzerland vs. Spain), season (August vs. February), sex, the inclusion of dietary supplements, and for different diet types and impact categories (climate change and biodiversity loss). Results indicate that, although optimized diets are similar, there are marked differences in the detailed composition depending on country, season, and impact considered, especially regarding legume choice. The lowest impact diet contained local and imported foods as well as fish. Vegan diets had the lowest impact only when incorporating a supplement to meet nutrient needs. We developed a tool to be used for personalized diet composition assessments for any global geographical location and season. We anticipate this work to be useful for developing country- and season-specific dietary guidelines and for consumers hoping to reduce their own personal impacts."
0,"EDs play a crucial role as frontline health services throughout public health emergencies, including pandemics. The strength of the Australian public health response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has mitigated the impact of the pandemic on clinical services, but there has still been a substantial impact on EDs and the health system. We revisit major events and lessons from the first wave of COVID-19 in Australia to consider the implications and avenues for system-level improvements for future pandemic and public health emergency response for EDs. Notwithstanding, the remarkable efforts of healthcare workers across the health system, COVID-19 has uncovered structural and planning challenges and highlighted weaknesses and strengths of the Australian federation. In anticipating future pandemics and other public health threats, particularly in the face of climate change, hard-won lessons from the COVID-19 response should be incorporated in future planning, policies, practice and advocacy."
1,"Out of eight Gyps species in the world, three residents (G. bengalensis, G. indicus, G. tenuirostris) and two migratory (G. fulvus, G. himalayensis) inhabit Indian forests and other landscapes. While Himalayan and Eurasian Gyps are near threatened and least concerned species, respectively, the resident Gyps are critically endangered. They are facing modification in habitats caused by anthropogenic factors and are enduring climate change. The impact of climate change has been insufficiently studied. The aim of this study is to predict current and future habitat suitability for these vultures shaped by bioenvironmental factors using maximum-entropy species distribution modelling. Seventy-one robust predictions and models, species and scenario wise (AUC 0.780 to 0.981, TSS 0.478 to 0.852 and CBI 0.978 to 0.997) were generated. Whole Indian landscape (3,287,263 km(2)) was categorised into unsuitable, moderately suitable and highly suitable habitats and analysed floristic region-wise. There was a reasonable change in habitat suitability which showed a trend of decrease in the suitable area in the future (3287 to 65,745 km(2)). The key environmental variables shaping current and future habitat included land use/land cover, annual mean temperature (bio1), precipitation of coldest quarter (bio19), precipitation seasonality (bio15) and precipitation of warmest quarter (bio18). Our results on the potential habitat in different floristic regions and projected change in future habitat will aid national and regional managers to design proactive approaches towards conservation of endangered Gyps vultures. Management interventions like in situ conservation, habitat maintenance, advance planning of habitat improvement, expansion of favourable area and protection of suitable area have been proposed."
1,"Forecasts of species range shifts as a result of climate change are essential, because invasions by exotic species shape biodiversity and therefore ecosystem functions and services. Ecologists have focused on propagule pressure (for example, the number of individuals and invasion events), the characteristics of an invading species, and its new abiotic and biotic environment to predict the likelihood of range expansion and invasion. Here, we emphasize the role of photoperiodic response on the range expansion of species. Unlike temperature, the latitudinal gradient of seasonal changes in day length is a stable, abiotic environmental factor that does not change with local or global climate. Predicting range expansions across latitudes and the subsequent consequences for native communities requires a more comprehensive understanding of how species use day length to coordinate seasonal growth, reproduction, physiology and synchronization of life cycles with interacting individuals and species."
1,"Understanding climate change impacts on hydrological regime and assessing future water supplies are essential to effective water resources management and planning, which is particularly true for the Tibetan Plateau (TP), one of the most vulnerable areas to climate change. In this study, future climate change in the TP was projected for 2041-2060 by a high-resolution regional climate model, RegCM4, under 3 representative concentration pathways (RCPs): 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5. Response of all key hydrological elements, that is, evapotranspiration, surface run-off, baseflow, and snowmelt, to future climate in 2 typical catchments, the source regions of Yellow and Yangtze rivers, was further investigated by the variable infiltration capacity microscale hydrological model incorporated with a 2-layer energy balance snow model and a frozen soil/permafrost algorithm at a 0.25 degrees x0.25 degrees spatial scale. The results reveal that (a) spatial patterns of precipitation and temperature from RegCM4 agree fairly well with the data from China Meteorological Forcing Dataset, indicating that RegCM4 well reproduces historical climatic information and thus is reliable to support future projection; (b) precipitation increase by 0-70% and temperature rise by 1-4 degrees C would occur in the TP under 3 RCPs. A clear south-eastern-north-western spatial increasing gradient in precipitation would be seen. Besides, under RCP8.5, the peak increase in temperature would approach to 4 degrees C in spring and autumn in the east of the TP; (c) evapotranspiration would increase by 10-60% in 2 source regions due to the temperature rise, surface run-off and baseflow in higher elevation region would experience larger increase dominantly due to the precipitation increase, and streamflow would display general increases by more than 3% and 5% in the source regions of Yellow and Yangtze rivers, respectively; (d) snowmelt contributes 11.1% and 16.2% to total run-off in the source regions of Yellow and Yangtze rivers, respectively, during the baseline period. In the source region of Yangtze River, snowmelt run-off would become more important with increase of 17.5% and 18.3%, respectively, under RCP2.6 and RCP4.5 but decrease of 15.0% under RCP8.5."
1,"One of our era's greatest scourges is air pollution, on account not only of its impact on climate change but also its impact on public and individual health due to increasing morbidity and mortality. There are many pollutants that are major factors in disease in humans. Among them, Particulate Matter (PM), particles of variable but very small diameter, penetrate the respiratory system via inhalation, causing respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, reproductive and central nervous system dysfunctions, and cancer. Despite the fact that ozone in the stratosphere plays a protective role against ultraviolet irradiation, it is harmful when in high concentration at ground level, also affecting the respiratory and cardiovascular system. Furthermore, nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), dioxins, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are all considered air pollutants that are harmful to humans. Carbon monoxide can even provoke direct poisoning when breathed in at high levels. Heavy metals such as lead, when absorbed into the human body, can lead to direct poisoning or chronic intoxication, depending on exposure. Diseases occurring from the aforementioned substances include principally respiratory problems such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), asthma, bronchiolitis, and also lung cancer, cardiovascular events, central nervous system dysfunctions, and cutaneous diseases. Last but not least, climate change resulting from environmental pollution affects the geographical distribution of many infectious diseases, as do natural disasters. The only way to tackle this problem is through public awareness coupled with a multidisciplinary approach by scientific experts; national and international organizations must address the emergence of this threat and propose sustainable solutions."
1,"Estimates of groundwater recharge spatial and temporal variability are essential inputs to groundwater flow models that are used to test groundwater availability under different management and climate conditions. In this study, a soil water balance analysis was conducted to estimate groundwater recharge on the island of Jeju, Korea, for baseline, drought, and climate-land use change scenarios. The Soil Water Balance (SWB) computer code was used to compute groundwater recharge and other water balance components at a daily time step using a 100 m grid cell size for an 18-year baseline scenario (1992-2009). A 10-year drought scenario was selected from historical precipitation trends (1961-2009), while the climate-land use change scenario was developed using late 21st century climate projections and a change in urban land use. Mean annual recharge under the baseline, drought, and climate-land use scenarios was estimated at 884,591, and 788 mm, respectively. Under the baseline scenario, mean annual recharge was within the range of previous estimates (825-959 mm) and only slightly lower than the mean of 902 mm. As a fraction of mean annual rainfall, mean annual recharge was computed as only 42% and less than previous estimates of 44-48%. The maximum historical reported annual pumping rate of 241 x 10(6) m(3) equates to 15% of baseline recharge, which is within the range of 14-16% computed from earlier studies. The model does not include a mechanism to account for additional sources of groundwater recharge, such as fog drip, irrigation, and artificial recharge, and may also overestimate evapotranspiration losses. Consequently, the results presented in this study represent a conservative estimate of total recharge. Published by Elsevier B.V."
0,"Changes in forest biomass and soil organic carbon reserves have strong links to atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration. Human activities such as livestock grazing, forest fires, selective logging and firewood extraction are the common disturbances that affect the carbon dynamics of the forest ecosystems. Here, we hypothesized that such anthropogenic activities significantly reduce the carbon stocks and accumulation rates in the tropical highland forests of the Sierra Madre de Chiapas in Southern Mexico. We sampled thePinus oocarpaScheide dominated forests within the elevation range of 900 to 1100 m above sea level in 2010, 2014 and 2017. We measured the stand structural properties and used the reported allometric equations to calculate the tree carbon stocks. Stock change approach was used to calculate carbon accumulation rates. The results showed a gradual increase in carbon storage over the 7-year period from 2010 to 2017, but the rate of increase varied significantly between the study sites. The aboveground carbon stock was 107.25 +/- 11.77 Mg ha(-1)for the site with lower anthropogenic intensity, compared to 74.29 +/- 16.85 Mg ha(-1)for the site with higher intensity. The current annual increment for the forest with lower anthropogenic intensity was 7.81 +/- 0.65 Mg ha(-1)a(-1), compared to 3.87 +/- 1.03 Mg ha(-1)a(-1)in the site with high anthropogenic intensity. Although at varying rates, these forests are functioning as important carbon sinks. The results on carbon accumulation rates have important implications in greenhouse gas mitigations and forest change modelling in the context of changing global climate."
1,"Basin-scale water scarcity, an adverse consequence of the imbalance between the available fresh water and water demands, is an alarming situation in many countries worldwide. This necessitates for analyzing the risk of water scarcity forced with the changing climate, land-use alterations, growing population, and industrialization to pave a way for sustainable water resources systems planning and management. This study advocates a hydrological model-based evaluation approach employing Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to identify the dominating drivers on the decadal streamflow patterns and other basin-scale water balance components, viz., blue water flow (BWF), green water storage (GWS), and green water flow (GWF) in the Brahmani and Baitarani River basins of eastern India. The results reveal that, in these basins, the climate change effect has relatively a higher impact on streamflow than the land-use change. This study surmises that the Brahmani and Baitarani River basins can be categorized under the high- and moderate-risk water scarcity zones, respectively. The developed approach of assessing the water scarcity risk under the non-availability of basin-scale sectoral water demands could be a reliable tool for many data-scarce river basins worldwide."
1,"The globalisation of trade and food, the increased volume and speed of international travel, climate change, and the related escalation of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases mean that countries are now more interconnected and interdependent than ever before. Africa is beleaguered by a range of endemic infectious and parasitic tropical diseases which, due to its diverse wildlife populations and indigenous livestock, can serve as a reservoir of high-impact or transboundary diseases and play a role in the emergence of disease, particularly at the wildlife, domestic animal and human interfaces. It is therefore essential to integrate animal and public health issues into the veterinary curriculum. Veterinary training in most parts of sub-Saharan Africa has focused on producing veterinarians to serve the livestock sector although socio-economic changes and privatisation of Veterinary Services have caused curriculum adjustments, as have globalisation and the increased risk of the spread of transboundary diseases. In South Africa, undergraduate veterinary training is more clinically oriented than in other regions. Animal and public health issues are covered in the curriculum, although their global relevance is not emphasised. The authors describe the undergraduate veterinary curriculum and summarise post-graduate programmes in South Africa. They also discuss a more comprehensive core-elective approach to the current curriculum and the need to adapt to new challenges facing the profession. Finally, they examine the potential use of innovative technology in undergraduate and post-graduate training and professional development, the importance of regional and international collaboration and the accreditation and recognition of veterinary training."
1,"The flood pulse is a key element characterizing the hydrology of the Mekong River and driving the high ecosystem productivity in the Lower Mekong floodplains, both in the Cambodian lowlands and the Mekong Delta in Vietnam. This paper assesses the impacts of climate change, both in terms of changed basin water balance and sea level rise, on the Lower Mekong flood pulse. The impacts were simulated by a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model using the projected changes in sea level and the Mekong mainstream discharge under the influence of climate change as boundary conditions. The model simulations projected that average and maximum water levels and flood duration increase in 2010-2049. The most consistent and notable changes occurred in the average and dry hydrological years. Sea level rise had the greatest effects in the Mekong Delta, whereas the impacts of changed basin water balance were more notable in the upper areas of the Mekong floodplains. The projected impacts were mostly opposite to those resulting from regional water infrastructure development. Higher and longer flooding could cause damage to crops, infrastructure and floodplain vegetation, and decrease the fertile land area. On the other hand, it might boost ecosystem productivity and enhance dry season water availability."
1,"Drought and heat stress, especially their combination, greatly affect crop production. Many studies have described transcriptome, proteome and phosphoproteome changes in response of plants to drought or heat stress. However, the study about the phosphoproteomic changes in response of crops to the combination stress is scare. To understand the mechanism of maize responses to the drought and heat combination stress, phosphoproteomic analysis was performed on maize leaves by using multiplex iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomic and LC-MS/MS methods. Five-leaf-stage maize was subjected to drought, heat or their combination, and the leaves were collected. Globally, heat, drought and the combined stress significantly changed the phosphorylation levels of 172, 149, and 144 phosphopeptides, respectively. These phosphopeptides corresponded to 282 proteins. Among them, 23 only responded to the combined stress and could not be predicted from their responses to single stressors; 30 and 75 only responded to drought and heat, respectively. Notably, 19 proteins were phosphorylated on different sites in response to the single and combination stresses. Of the seven significantly enriched phosphorylation motifs identified, two were common for all stresses, two were common for heat and the combined stress, and one was specific to the combined stress. The signaling pathways in which the phosphoproteins were involved clearly differed among the three stresses. Functional characterization of the phosphoproteins and the pathways identified here could lead to new targets for the enhancement of crop stress tolerance, which will be particularly important in the face of climate change and the increasing prevalence of abiotic stressors."
0,"Mitigation pathways allowing for temperature overshoot often ignore the related climate and macroeconomic impacts. Net-zero pathways with limited overshoot could reduce low-probability high-consequence risks and economic loss. Mitigation pathways exploring end-of-century temperature targets often entail temperature overshoot. Little is known about the additional climate risks generated by overshooting temperature. Here we assessed the benefits of limiting overshoot. We computed the probabilistic impacts for different warming targets and overshoot levels on the basis of an ensemble of integrated assessment models. We explored both physical and macroeconomic impacts, including persistent and non-persistent climate impacts. We found that temperature overshooting affects the likelihood of many critical physical impacts, such as those associated with heat extremes. Limiting overshoot reduces risk in the right tail of the distribution, in particular for low-temperature targets where larger overshoots arise as a way to lower short-term mitigation costs. We also showed how, after mid-century, overshoot leads to both higher mitigation costs and economic losses from the additional impacts. The study highlights the need to include climate risk analysis in low-carbon pathways."
0,"Climate change mitigation strategies cannot be evaluated solely in terms of energy cost and greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation potential. Maintaining GHGs at a safe level will require fundamental change in the way we approach energy production, and a number of environmental, economic, and societal factors will come into play. Water is an essential component of energy production, and water resource constraints will limit our options for meeting society's growing demand for energy while also reducing GHG emissions. This study evaluates these potential constraints from a global perspective by revisiting the climate wedges proposal of Pacala and Socolow (Science 2004, 305 (5686), 968-972) and evaluating the potential water-use impacts of the wedges associated with energy production. GHG mitigation options that improve energy conversion or use efficiency can simultaneously reduce GHG emissions, lower energy costs, and reduce energy impacts on water resources. Other GHG mitigation options (e.g., carbon capture and sequestration, traditional nuclear, and biofuels from dedicated energy crops) increase water requirements for energy. Achieving energy sustainability requires deployment of alternatives that can reduce GHG emissions, water resource impacts, and energy costs."
1,"Global climate change-related water deficit negatively affect the growth, development and yield performance of multiple cereal crops, including durum wheat. Therefore, the improvement of water-deficit stress tolerance in durum wheat varieties in arid and semiarid areas has become imperative for food security. Herein, we evaluated the water deficiency resilience potential of two marker-free transgenic durum wheat lines (AlSAP-lines: K9.3 and K21.3) under well-watered and water-deficit stress conditions at both physiological and agronomic levels. These two lines overexpressed the AlSAP gene, isolated from the halophyte grass Aeluropus littoralis, encoding a stress-associated zinc finger protein containing the A20/AN1 domains. Under well-watered conditions, the wild-type (WT) and both AlSAP-lines displayed comparable performance concerning all the evaluated parameters. Ectopic transgene expression exerted no adverse effects on growth and yield performance of the durum wheat plants. Under water-deficit conditions, no significant differences in the plant height, leaf number, spike length, and spikelet number were observed between AlSAP-lines and WT plants. However, compared to WT, the AlSAP-lines exhibited greater dry matter production, greater flag leaf area, improved net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, and water use efficiency. Notably, the AlSAP-lines displayed 25 % higher grain yield (GY) than the WT plants under water-deficit conditions. The RT-qPCR-based selected stress-related gene (TdDREB1, TdLEA, TdAPX1, and TdBlt101-2) expression analyses indicated stress-related genes enhancement in AlSAP-durum wheat plants under both well-watered and water-deficit conditions, potentially related to the water-deficit resilience. Collectively, our findings support that the ectopic AlSAP expression in durum wheat lines enhances water-deficit resilience ability, thereby potentially compensate for the GY loss in arid and semi-arid regions."
1,"The Harbison's dun skipper subspecies (Euphyes vestris harbisoni) has a geographically limited distribution in southern California, USA and northern Mexico, isolated from the other subspecies. This skipper is a specialist, primarily found in riparian oak woodlands and only feeds on the San Diego sedge as a larva. Several extirpations have been documented, generating concern for its long-term persistence. We conducted visual surveys in 2021 and 2022, and a marking study in 2022, to assess population sizes. Habitat preferences were explored by collecting habitat covariates and analyzing GIS available environmental data. A significant decline in skipper counts occurred during a drought, with abundances remaining small following the drought. Population size estimates from a marking study had low accuracy due to the small population sizes. For this reason, we used the annual maximum count (Max Count) as a robust and efficient metric for monitoring this skipper. No difference was found between used and unused sedge patches using vegetation-based habitat covariates. However, a GIS approach described the historic distribution as woodlands at intermediate elevations, warmer summer temperatures, and intermediate levels of summer evapotranspiration. Implications for insect conservation: The decline in abundance and number of populations justify future conservation efforts, including identifying areas that should be prioritized for future surveys and restoration efforts. Most importantly, this study demonstrates that these woodlands should be managed/protected in their entirety to allow for annual movement of sedge plants and skippers."
1,"Monitoring changes in river runoff at the Third Pole (TP) is important because rivers in this region support millions of inhabitants in Asia and are very sensitive to climate change. Under the influence of climate change and intensified cryospheric melt, river runoff has changed markedly at the TP, with significant effects on the spatial and temporal water resource distribution that threaten water supply and food security for people living downstream. Despite some in situ observations and discharge estimates from state-of-the-art remote sensing technology, the total river runoff (TRR) for the TP has never been reliably quantified, and its response to climate change remains unclear. As part of the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Pan-Third Pole Environment Study for a Green Silk Road, the TP-River project aims to construct a comprehensive runoff observation network at mountain outlets (where rivers leave the mountains and enter the plains) for 13 major rivers in the TP region, thereby enabling TRR to be accurately quantified. The project also integrates discharge estimates from remote sensing and cryosphere-hydrology modeling to investigate long-term changes in TRR and the relationship between the TRR variations and westerly/monsoon. Based on recent efforts, the project provides the first estimate (656 +/- 23 billion m(3)) of annual TRR for the 13 TP rivers in 2018. The annual river runoff at the mountain outlets varies widely between the different TP rivers, ranging from 2 to 176 billion m(3), with higher values mainly corresponding to rivers in the Indian monsoon domain, rather than in the westerly domain."
1,"Global climate and land use changes could strongly affect soil erosion and the capability of soils to sustain agriculture and in turn impact regional or global food security. The objective of our study was to develop a method to assess soil sustainability to erosion under changes in land use and climate. The method was applied in a typical mixed Mediterranean landscape in a wine-growing watershed (75 km(2)) within the Languedoc region (La Peyne, France) for two periods: a first period with the current climate and land use and a second period with the climate and land use scenarios at the end of the twenty-first century. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change A1B future rainfall scenarios from the Mete France General circulation model was coupled with four contrasting land use change scenarios that were designed using a spatially-explicit land use change model. Mean annual erosion rate was estimated with an expert-based soil erosion model. Soil life expectancy was assessed using soil depth. Soil erosion rate and soil life expectancy were combined into a sustainability index. The median simulated soil erosion rate for the current period was 3.5 t/ha/year and the soil life expectancy was 273 years, showing a low sustainability of soils. For the future period with the same land use distribution, the median simulated soil erosion rate was 4.2 t/ha/year and the soil life expectancy was 249 years. The results show that soil erosion rate and soil life expectancy are more sensitive to changes in land use than to changes in precipitation. Among the scenarios tested, institution of a mandatory grass cover in vineyards seems to be an efficient means of significantly improving soil sustainability, both in terms of decreased soil erosion rates and increased soil life expectancies.

0,"An open-top chamber experiment was conducted in the present study to investigate the growth and biochemical responses of six sorghum genotypes under two irrigation regimes (based on 40% and 75% soil-water depletion) and two N fertilizer levels (0 and 105 kgN ha(-1)), at two atmospheric CO2 conditions (390 +/- 50 and 700 +/- 50 mu mol mol(-1)). The results revealed that water limited stress decreased the plant dry weight by reducing the plant leaf area, SPAD value, Fv/Fm, leaf RWC and membrane stability index (MSI), while it increased the specific activity of APX, CAT and PDX enzymes, DPPH, LPC, Phe, TSC, H2O2, MDA and EL. The lowest decrease of the plant dry weight due to limited water stress was observed in the GS5 genotype, which was followed by the lowest decrease in the leaf RWC and MSI; also, the highest increase was seen in APX, Phe and TSC, while the lowest one was recorded in EL. Elevated CO2 improved DPPH and Phe under both control and water limited conditions, resulting in the decrease of APX, PDX, H2O2 and EL, while a more pronounced effect was observed in the stress conditions. Furthermore, with the application of nitrogen, the reduction in DPPH, H2O2 and MDA values was greater under water limited stress rather than control conditions. It could be, therefore, concluded that the responses of sorghum genotypes to water deficit stress had interaction with atmospheric CO2 concentrations and nitrogen levels; this could be considered in breeding programs as well as planting management of sorghum."
1,"Fishing and climate change impact the demography of marine fishes, but it is generally ignored that many species are made up of genetically distinct locally adapted populations that may show idiosyncratic responses to environmental and anthropogenic pressures. Here, we track 80 years of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) population dynamics in West Greenland using DNA from archived otoliths in combination with fish population and niche based modeling. We document how the interacting effects of climate change and high fishing pressure lead to dramatic spatiotemporal changes in the proportions and abundance of different genetic populations, and eventually drove the cod fishery to a collapse in the early 1970s. Our results highlight the relevance of fisheries management at the level of genetic populations under future scenarios of climate change."
0,"Studies of Antarctic eukaryotes have been hampered by their morphological conservatism, small size and the logistical constraints of remote field work, resulting in a deficiency of baseline biodiversity information about Antarctic terrestrial environments. The application of high throughput sequencing (HTS) in metataxonomic approaches is a promising alternative. Here, we apply such HTS approaches to the hitherto largely unsurveyed micro-eukaryote fauna of the Prince Charles Mountains, East Antarctica. We sequenced 18S rDNA amplicons of twelve Antarctic bulk-soil DNA extracts, retrieved from three sampling regions (four bulk-soil extracts per sampling region). After isolating eukaryotic phylotypes with a stringent filtering approach and initial network visualization, we firstly used rarefied data to compare four alpha diversity metrics between the three regions. Weighted and unweighted inter-sample UniFrac distances were then used for beta diversity comparisons among rarefied data. Furthermore, we analysed the distribution of the most abundant phylotypes and phylotype groups. Lastly, we checked the validity of species-level taxonomic assignments using different sets of reference data in conjunction with two different taxonomy assignment approaches. Phylotype numbers in un-rarefied data compared across regions were lowest for Mount Menzies (73 degrees S; 3330 m), intermediate at Mawson Escarpment (73 degrees S; 807 m) and highest at Lake Terrasovoje (70 degrees S; 173 m), likely due to low biological load at the higher latitude and elevation inland sites. Analysis of rarefied data was difficult due to low sequence coverage particularly from Mount Menzies, but indicated differences in Shannon diversity between Mawson Escarpment and Lake Terrasovoje. PCoA of weighted UniFrac distances between samples from Mawson Escarpment and Lake Terrasovoje indicated changes in community composition in relation to elevation of the sampling locations. The most widespread phylotypes were fungal, followed by non-algal protists. Species-level assignments included known Antarctic taxa in all sampling regions. We show that HIS can provide a rapid survey of the micro-eukaryote fauna to provide baseline biodiversity information for remote, harsh, and hitherto largely unsurveyed environments in the Prince Charles Mountains.

1,"Global warming is posing a threat to the health and condition of forests as the amount and length of biotic and abiotic disturbances increase. Most methods for detecting disturbances and measuring forest health are based on multi- and hyperspectral imaging. We conducted a test with spruce and pine trees using a hyperspectral Lidar instrument in a laboratory to determine the capability of combined range and reflectance measurements to investigate forest health. A simple drought treatment was conducted by leaving the harvested trees outdoors without a water supply for 12 days. The results showed statistically significant variation in reflectance after the drought treatment for both species. However, the changes differed between the species, indicating that drought-induced alterations in spectral characteristics may be species-dependent. Based on our results, hyperspectral Lidar has the potential to detect drought in spruce and pine trees."
1,"Precipitation within extratropical cyclones is very likely to increase towards the end of the century in a business-as-usual scenario. We investigate hourly precipitation changes in end-of-century winter storms with the first km-scale model ensemble covering northwest Europe and the Baltic region. This is an ensemble that explicitly represents convection (convection permitting models (CPMs)). Models agree that future winter storms will bring 10%-50% more precipitation, with the same level of light precipitation but more moderate and heavy precipitation, together with less frequent frozen precipitation. The warm sector precipitation rates will get closer (up to similar) to those in present-day autumn storms, along with higher convective available potential energy and convective inhibition, suggesting more convection embedded in storms. To the first order, mean hourly precipitation changes in winter storms are driven by temperature increase (with little relative humidity changes) and storm dynamical intensity (more uncertain), both captured by regional climate models (RCMs). The CPMs agree with this, and in addition, most CPMs show more increase in intense precipitation in the warm sector of storms compared to their parent RCM."
1,"Climate change will cause important declines in environmental suitability, especially when living at high elevations. The critically endangered Salamandra lanzai from the Alps may be severely exposed to future climate change effects and its suitable climate niche may shrink or shift. Another Alpine salamander (S. atra) is present in the region, which in case of spatial overlap may represent a risk for S. lanzai. It is urgent to estimate the effect of future climate change on these species and identify priority areas for conservation while preventing their sympatry. With a species distribution modelling (SDM) approach, we projected the current and future climate suitability of both salamander species. We accounted for uncertainty related to the methods (model replicates) and climate projections (data source, global circulation model and scenario) to provide a consensus map for practitioners. This map also takes into account potential sympatry with S. atra by penalizing the suitability scores of S. lanzai by the scores of S. atra. We predict a severe effect of climate change on both species distributions. Most of the current habitats are projected to become largely unsuitable by 2070, regardless of the climatology and scenario. We identified important spatial disagreements between projections based on different data sources, mostly due to precipitation projections and daily temperature variation. This highlights the need to account for multiple climatologies in mountainous environments. The habitat of both species is highly fragmented, which is expected to limit distributional shifts through natural dispersion. We suggest to explore the possibility of translocation for the most threatened populations and simultaneously develop captive breeding programs. Biotic interactions are rarely accounted for in SDMs, and we encourage the documentation of species with similar ecological requirements to improve the relevance of SDMs for future conservation planning."
1,"Expansion of agricultural land use has increased emission of greenhouse gases, exacerbating climatic changes. Most agricultural soils have lost a large portion of their antecedent soil organic carbon storage, becoming a source of atmospheric carbon-dioxide. In addition, agricultural soils can also be a major source of nitrous oxide and methane. Adoption of conservation agricultural practices may mitigate some of the adverse impacts of landuse intensification. However, optimal implementation of these practices is not feasible under all physical and biotic conditions. Of a wide range of conservation practices, the most promising options include agroforestry systems and soil application of biochar, which can efficiently sequester large amounts of carbon over the long-run. In addition, these practices also increase agronomic productivity and support a range of ecosystem services. Payments to farmers and land managers for sequestrating carbon and improving ecosystem services is an important strategy for promoting the adoption of such practices, aimed at mitigating climate change while decreasing environmental footprint of agriculture and sustaining food security."
1,"Extreme daily precipitation for the current and changed climate at appropriate spatial scales is assessed. This is done in the context of the impact of climate change on flooding in the river Meuse in Western Europe. The objective is achieved by determining and comparing extreme precipitation from stations, reanalysis projects, global climate models and regional climate models. An extreme value reduction methodoloy based on extreme precipitation correlation structure and surface area is used to deal with the transformation between different spatial scales. It appeared that return values are simulated quite well by the regional climate models and CSIRO9, but are underestimated by the reanalyses and overestimated by CGCM1 and HadCM3. The models simulated an average increase in extreme precipitation with climate change of about 18%, which is in the same range as the average model error and intermodel differences. The appropriate spatial scale for representing extreme precipitation was estimated at 20 km, when the bias permitted in the estimation of extreme precipitation is set at 10%. Downscaling modelled extreme precipitation to this appropriate scale results in considerable differences between reanalysis and GCM scale and appropriate scale return values. It is therefore obvious that return values at these appropriate scales should be used instead of at their original scales. Copyright (C) 2002 Royal Meteorological Society."
1,"One of the largest restoration programs in the world, the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) aims to restore freshwater inputs to Everglades wetlands and the Florida Bay estuary. This study predicted how the Florida Bay ecosystem may respond to hydrological restoration from CERP within the context of contemporary projected impacts of sea-level rise (SLR) and increased future temperatures. A spatial-temporal dynamic model (Ecospace) was used to develop a spatiotemporal food web model incorporating environmental drivers of salinity, salinity variation, temperature, depth, distance to mangrove, and seagrass abundance and was used to predict responses of biomass, fisheries catch, and ecosystem resilience between current and future conditions. Changes in biomass between the current and future scenario suggest a suite of winners and losers, with many estuarine species increasing in both total biomass and spatial distribution. Notable biomass increases were predicted for important forage species, including bay anchovy (+32%), hardhead halfbeak (+19%), and pinfish (+31%), while decreases were predicted in mullet (-88%), clupeids (-55%), hardhead silverside (-15%), mojarras (-117%), and Portunid crabs (-16%). Increases in sportfish biomass included the angler-preferred spotted seatrout (+9%), red drum (+10%), and gray snapper (+8%), while decreases included sheepshead (-40%), Atlantic tarpon (-73%), and common snook (-507%). Ecosystem resilience and fisheries catch of angler-preferred species were predicted to improve in the future scenario in total, although a localized decline in resilience predicted for the Central Region may warrant further attention. Our results suggest the Florida Bay ecosystem is likely to achieve restoration benefits in spite of, and in some cases facilitated by, the projected future impacts from climate change due to the system's shallow depth and detrital dominance. The incorporation of climate impacts into long-term restoration planning using ecosystem modeling in similar systems facing unknown futures of SLR, warming seas, and shifting species distributions is recommended."
1,"Phenuiviridae is a large family of arthropod-borne viruses with over 100 species worldwide. Several cause severe diseases in both humans and livestock. Global warming and the apparent geographical expansion of arthropod vectors are good reasons to seriously consider these viruses potential agents of emerging diseases. With an increasing frequency and number of epidemics, some phenuiviruses represent a global threat to public and veterinary health. This review focuses on the early stage of phenuivirus infection in mammalian host cells. We address current knowledge on each step of the cell entry process, from virus binding to penetration into the cytosol. Virus receptors, endocytosis, and fusion mechanisms are discussed in light of the most recent progress on the entry of banda-, phlebo-, and uukuviruses, which together constitute the three prominent genera in the Phenuiviridae family."
1,"Most of the biodiversity studies in the South European Atlantic Shelf ecoregion are limited to shallow subtidal or intertidal habitats, while deeper reef habitats, also of relevant ecological importance, are particularly understudied. Macroalgal communities, associated fauna, and sea surface temperature were studied in deep reefs (25-30 m) at two locations in this ecoregion: Parcel, North of Portugal (41 degrees N), and Tarifa, Southern Spain (35 degrees N). Specifically, algal assemblages were assessed using biomass collection and associated ichthyofauna was assessed using visual census techniques using scuba. Seawater surface temperature was higher (>3 degrees C) in the southern region-Tarifa, compared to the northern region-Parcel. Our survey revealed 18 fish species and 23 algae species. The highest abundance of cold-water species (both macroalgae and fish species) was recorded in Parcel and warm-water species were dominant in Tarifa. In light of climate global trends, both regions might experience biodiversity shifts towards tropicalization. Current knowledge on their biodiversity is imperative to further evaluate potential shifts."
1,"Bottom-up field-based, crop-hydrological models are used to estimate food production and irrigation water extractions under multiple scenarios of water and nitrogen use and crop yield increases from 2010 to 2050 for 19 countries. The results show: (1) a food deficit before 2050 under a worst case climate change scenario in terms of annual crop yield improvement; (2) substantial water deficits, as a result of irrigation, for major food-producing countries that will prevent these nations from meeting their domestic food requirements in the absence of investments in water infrastructure or food imports; and (3) a plateau in terms of crop food production associated with increased water extractions given no further increase in the current area of irrigated agriculture. Possible pathways to respond to the tensions in the food-water nexus are evaluated and include: (1) higher water productivity; (2) food trade; (3) improvements in both crop yield and sustainable total factor productivity; (4) greater investment in water infrastructure; and (5) integrative policies and decision processes. Without a combination of some, or all, of these possible pathways, appropriately adapted to bio-physical and socio-economic circumstances, the world faces grave risks in food and water security out to 2050."
1,"The significantly lower annual rainfall experienced in Australia over the past decade together with projections of long-term climate change has placed increased emphasis on the use of pasture plants with superior tolerance to environmental stress, particularly drought, to ensure persistence for the grazing industries. Summer dormancy is one of the more important traits that grasses have to adapt to environments where there is little, variable, or no summer rainfall. In this article, the role that the summer dormancy trait has played in enhancing the survival of temperate perennial grasses in Australia is reviewed with special reference to orchardgrass (cocksfoot; Dactylis glomerata L.) and tall fescue [Lolium arundinaceum (Schreb.) Darbysh.]. The performance of cultivars and populations with this trait is assessed in comparison to germ-plasm without the trait. Other major factors such as the contribution of rooting depth to stress tolerance and their possible relationship with summer dormancy are documented and evaluated. Current knowledge of the physiological basis by which summer dormancy improves survival of summer drought is also summarized."
0,"Living in remote places can strain the adaptive capacities of human settlers. It can also protect communities from external social, political and economic forces. In this paper, we present an archaeological population history of the Kuril Islands. This string of small volcanic islands on the margins of the Northwest Pacific was occupied by maritime hunting, fishing and gathering communities from the mid Holocene to recent centuries. We bring together (1) 380 new and previously published archaeological radiocarbon dates, (2) a new paleodemographic model based on a radiocarbon-timestamped temporal frequency distribution of archaeological deposits, (3) recently published paleoclimate trends, and (4) recently published archaeological proxy evidence for changes in the extent of social networks. We demonstrate that, over the last two millennia, inhabitants of the Kuril Islands underwent dramatic demographic fluctuations. Explanations of these fluctuations are considered in the context of environmental hazards, social networks and the emergence of an East Asian World System, elucidating the tension between local and external adaptive strategies to social and ecological uncertainty. Results suggest that population resilience to local climate and environmental variability was achieved by virtue of social networks that maintained non-local support in times of crisis. Conversely, the expansion of the East Asian political economy into neighboring regions of the southern margin of the Kuril Islands perhaps in conjunction with exposure to epidemic diseases appears to have undermined the adaptive strategies, resulting in an increase in the vulnerability of Kuril populations to environmental fluctuations.

0,"The discriminating capacity (i.e. ability to correctly classify presences and absences) of species distribution models (SDMs) is commonly evaluated with metrics such as the area under the receiving operating characteristic curve (AUC), the Kappa statistic and the true skill statistic (TSS). AUC and Kappa have been repeatedly criticized, but TSS has fared relatively well since its introduction, mainly because it has been considered as independent of prevalence. In addition, discrimination metrics have been contested because they should be calculated on presence-absence data, but are often used on presence-only or presence-background data. Here, we investigate TSS and an alternative set of metricssimilarity indices, also known as F-measures. We first show that even in ideal conditions (i.e. perfectly random presence-absence sampling), TSS can be misleading because of its dependence on prevalence, whereas similarity/F-measures provide adequate estimations of model discrimination capacity. Second, we show that in real-world situations where sample prevalence is different from true species prevalence (i.e. biased sampling or presence-pseudoabsence), no discrimination capacity metric provides adequate estimation of model discrimination capacity, including metrics specifically designed for modelling with presence-pseudoabsence data. Our conclusions are twofold. First, they unequivocally impel SDM users to understand the potential shortcomings of discrimination metrics when quality presence-absence data are lacking, and we recommend obtaining such data. Second, in the specific case of virtual species, which are increasingly used to develop and test SDM methodologies, we strongly recommend the use of similarity/F-measures, which were not biased by prevalence, contrary to TSS."
1,"The temporal and spatial distribution of Hirnantian brachiopod faunas are reviewed based on a new, comprehensive dataset from over 20 palaeoplates and terranes, a revised correlation scheme for Hirnantian strata and numerical methods including network analysis. There were two successive evolutionary faunas: 1. widespread and diachronous Hirnantia Fauna related to the glacial acme in the early-mid Hirnantian, including shallow, deeper and deep-water communities that diversified in much more complicated environmental conditions than hitherto envisaged; and 2. Edgewood-Cathay Fauna (new term) thrived during post-glacial, warmer, shallowwater regimes with both carbonate and siliciclastic facies from low latitudes in the late Hirnantian-early Rhuddanian. The two survival faunas occur in the same order in different regions, immediately following the first and second phases of the Hirnantian crisis, respectively. This faunal succession records two climatic perturbations, one with a glaciation, associated with climatic cooling and a global low-stand, during which the Hirnantia Fauna flourished, and a second characterized by melting ice, global warming, and sea-level rise (with global anoxia), aligned to the development of the Edgewood-Cathay Fauna and the repopulation of the seas by many animals adapted to warmer water, e.g., those in metazoan reefs, massive tabulates, and sponges. Changes in many properties of the Hirnantia Fauna may have resulted from the heterogeneity of global climate change in time and space; contrasts in the Edgewood-Cathay faunas record differences between carbonate and siliciclastic deposition, respectively, at low latitudes. Intense climate changes, sea-level fluctuations, and oceanographic ventilation and anoxia, had important roles in brachiopod evolution through the Hirnantian extinctions as first taxa confined to warm-water and then cool-water conditions were the main victims. During the Hirnantian, higher originations of new taxa may have been a response to crises, which increased the rate of phyletic evolution due to extreme climatic conditions."
1,"Sesame is predominantly cultivated in rainfed and low fertile lands and is frequently exposed to terminal drought. Sesamum species inhabiting dryland ecosystems adaptively diverge from those inhabiting rainfed habitats, and drought-specific traits have a genetic basis. In sesame, traits associated with drought conditions have not been explored to date, yet studies of these traits are needed given that drought is predicted to become more frequent and severe in many parts of the world because of climate change. Here, 76 accessions from the available Indian core set were used to quantify variation in several traits under irrigated (WW) and terminal drought stress (WS) conditions as well as their association with seed yield over two consecutive years. The range of trait variation among the studied genotypes under WW and WS was significant. Furthermore, the traits associated with seed yield under WW and WS differed. The per se performance of the accessions indicated that the expression of most traits was reduced under WS. The correlation analysis revealed that the number of branches, leaf area (LA), leaves dry weight (LDW), number of capsules plant(-1), and harvest index (HI) were positively correlated with seed yield under WW and WS, and total dry matter (TDM), plant stem weight, and canopy temperature (CT) were negatively correlated with seed yield under WW and WS, indicating that smaller and cooler canopy genotypes had higher yields. The genotypes IC-131936, IC-204045, IC-204861, IC-205363, IC-205311, and IC-73576 with the highest seed yields were characterized by low canopy temperature, high relative water content, and high harvest index under WS. Phenotypic and molecular diversity analysis was conducted on genotypes along with checks. Phenotypic diversity was assessed using multivariate analysis, whereas molecular diversity was estimated using simple sequence repeat (SSR) loci to facilitate the use of sesame in breeding and genetic mapping. SSRs showed low allelic variation, as indicated by a low average number of alleles (2.31) per locus, gene diversity (0.25), and polymorphism information content (0.22). Cluster analysis (CA) [neighbor-joining (NJ) tree] revealed three major genotypic groups and structure analysis showed 4 populations. The diverse genotypes identified with promising morpho-physiological traits can be used in breeding programs to develop new varieties."
0,"Global food demand is increasing due to population growth and dietary transitions, resulting from rising incomes, are associated with increased prevalence of non-communicable diseases. Improving the sustainability of the food sector is also critical for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. This study assesses for the first time the greenhouse gases emissions (Carbon Footprint - CF), the water footprint (WF) and the cost of three omnivorous diets recommended in Spain due to their health benefits: the Mediterranean diet (MD), the Southern European Atlantic diet (SEAD) and the Spanish dietary guidelines (NAOS). Analysis was conducted using standard Life Cycle Assessment and WF methods together with current Spanish food price data. The dietary energy recommendation of the SEAD is greater than that of MD and NAOS (11 and 15% respectively), and SEAD also has greater animal source food content than the other two diets. SEAD has a concomitantly higher CF, WF and cost scores in comparison with MD (+30%, +23% and +21% respectively) and NAOS (+15%, +9% and +21% respectively). Adjusting recommendations to meet the suggested Spanish adult dietary energy of 2228 kcal.capita(-1).day(-1) changed the environmental profiles of the diets and the NAOS has the highest environmental impact. However, the isocaloric diets had approximately the same cost. Analysis of the WF of the diets identified the major contribution of precipitation (the green WF) to the overall WF (88% of the total) and the significant contribution of animal-source foods to dietary WF. Regardless of the dietary scenario, better scores were identified for the Spanish recommendations analysed than those reported for other healthy diets identified in Europe. Differences in the recommended intake levels of certain food groups, cooking techniques and the origin of food products are behind these results. Environmental indicators should be considered alongside nutrition and health metrics when defining national dietary guidelines. Supporting citizens to follow healthy and environmentally-friendly dietary recommendations through, among other things, information campaigns and nutritional education programmes is essential. It is recommended the incorporation not only of health, but also of environmental indicators of these dietary options in the national dietary guidelines, as well as implementation of information campaigns and nutritional education programs among citizens to promote their adhesion since balanced dietary habits rich on plant-based products and low on animal-based ones involve multiple health and environmental benefits.

0,"REDD + programs and projects aim to mitigate climate change by reducing deforestation and forest degradation and enhancing forest carbon stocks. The viability of REDD + programs depends in a large part on their opportunity costs (OCs); however, large variation exists in the estimated OC. This study aims to quantify the variation in OC reported in the literature and identify its causes. In addition to a careful description, a meta analysis was conducted to examine the heterogeneities across the different estimating methods, data sources, deforestation drivers, and geographic regions found in previous studies. Our results show a large variation in the estimated OC because of differences in data sources, assumptions about future markets, and factors, such as carbon density, crop price and yield, and time horizon. Furthermore, variation exists even among studies of the same driver(s) of deforestation and forest degradation, within the same continent, and from the same data source. Time horizon is the largest contributor to cost variation, followed by carbon density and crop price. Geographically, the OCs are $19.49/tCO(2)e in Africa, $9.19/tCO(2)e in Asia Pacific, and $4.33/tCO(2)e in Latin America, respectively. Despite their large variation, the REDD + OCs remain fairly low in most reasonable cases."
1,"Agricultural production is sensitive to climate variability, so climate change-agriculture sector nexus is topical in developing countries. To this end, this study examines the impact of climate change variables-rainfall and temperature-and non-climatic factors on maize production in Somalia for the period between 1980 and 2018 using the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bound test, dynamic ordinary least square (DOLS), variance decomposition(VD), and impulse response function (IRF). The empirical results of the ARDL bound test confirmed the presence of long-run cointegration between the dependent variable and the explanatory variables. Furthermore, the long-run results revealed that average temperature, average rainfall, and political instability significantly inhibit maize production in the long and short runs, but rainfall has a favorable effect on maize production in the short run. Furthermore, rural population and land area under maize cultivation have negative and positive effects on maize production in the long run, respectively-albeit they are statistically insignificant. The empirical results of the study are robust to different econometric methods. Based on these findings, the study emphasizes the importance of the de-escalation of conflicts and the implementation of irrigation facilities which will enhance the productivity of maize crop production."
1,"Biochar prepared from organic waste through pyrolysis, thermal combustion in an inert environment, generates a stable form of carbon. The review of established literature reveals that conversion of organic matter into biochar and its addition to soil also reduces the negative effects of carbon aerosols on human health and greenhouse gas effects on environment through carbon sequestration. Physicochemical properties of biochar such as nutrient sorption capacity, pH, pore structure, particle size, surface area, and mineral content play a vital role in determining the soil structure and function. Biochar addition to soil exerts measurable changes in physicochemical soil properties such as bulk density, water-holding capacity, pH and cation exchange capacity, microbial community structure, and their interrelated functions in soil. However, addition of biochar to specific soil improves the soil fertility, and consequently improves the crop yield. It is concluded that optimized pyrolysis of organic waste for biochar production and its use for soils need diversified investigation in diverse environmental conditions."
1,"Unregulated land use/cover change (LUCC) has imposed significant local, regional and global impacts on livelihood and environment, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Previous studies well documented the extent and drivers of such spectacular LUCC in East Africa. However, data on regional/local impacts particularly that combine its socioeconomic and environmental effects are very scanty currently. Hence, this study is aimed to assess the socio-environmental impacts of LUCC in more dynamic and fragile landscapes of the Ethiopian Central Rift Valley lakes region. We used a combination of data from Remote Sensing, GIS-based processing, household survey and meteorological stations to quantify and analyze LUCC impacts. Results indicated that a rapid LUCC has occurred in the region over the last three decades which imposed a number of socioeconomic and environment-related impacts. Based on the percentage of respondent farmers, climate change (95%), soil productivity decline (94%), land degradation (92%), shortage of wood (91%), shortage of grazing land (89%), soil erosion (88%), loss of biodiversity (81%) and lake water retreat (74%), are the principal impacts of LUCC perceived. Such perceived impacts of LUCC are in line with the observed results obtained from comprehensive measured data analysis. Future land use policies need to consider management options that work on reducing anthropogenic-induced pressures on the environment and encouraging livelihood diversification in order to minimize the adverse socio-environmental impacts of spectacular LUCC in the region."
0,"The main objective of this paper is to trim down the global warming potential (GWP) which is emitted from various sectors such as domestic, commercial, industry, transportation and agriculture. In this paper, electricity expansion planning problem is analysed for an Indian state, Tamil Nadu, for a period of 30 years from 2019 to 2048 using the LEAP software. Two scenarios, base line scenario and GHG mitigation scenario, are developed. The results show that GHG mitigation scenario can reduce the GWP by 2,189.2 MMT compared to base line scenario. The cost of avoiding GHGs is estimated as 117.3 USD/tonne CO(2)e. Overall, this study's findings provide insights into TN's future energy and highlight potential measures for the creation of a sustainable low-carbon state in India."
0,"Agriculture plays an integral part in facilitating socioeconomic development in Nepal. However, it is also associated with environmental concerns which need to be controlled for the sake of ensuring environmental and agricultural sustainability in tandem. Against this backdrop, this current study aims to check whether shocks to the levels of agricultural productivity, land utilization for crop production, and fertilizer consumption influence the carbon dioxide emission figures of Nepal over the 1965-2018 period. The long-run associations between these variables are confirmed from the cointegration analysis. Besides, the outcomes from the asymmetric non-linear autoregressive distributed lag regression analysis show that crop productivity does not influence the emission levels in Nepal. However, a decline in the land area used for crop production purposes is evidenced to trigger higher emissions of carbon dioxide both in the short- and long run. On the other hand, higher fertilizer consumption is found to boost the short- and long-run carbon dioxide emission levels in Nepal. Accordingly, considering the objective of reducing agriculture-based emissions, this study recommends the Nepalese government to adopt policies that can enhance the productivity of low energy-intensive crop production, stimulate green agriculture and non-agriculture activities, and minimize the use of chemical fertilizers in arable lands."
0,"The aim of this paper is to identify a parameterization method that considers existing connections and relationships between traditional indicators of environmental sustainability as a step in combating climate change via urban strategies. A typical Mediterranean city (Ancona, Italy) is investigated with a multi-objective optimization platform called modeFrontier, which uses Pareto optimality. This concept formalizes the trade-off between a given set of mutually contradicting objectives, such as high thermal comfort and low energy consumption, to identify a set of Pareto solutions. A solution is Pareto optimal when it is not possible to improve one objective without deteriorating at least one of the others. The optimization process employs given constraints (for example, meteorological scenarios with high temperature and low winds or morphological building parameters), custom procedural algorithms (recursive algorithms to generate the set of all non-dominated objective parameters), and genetic algorithms (inspired by the natural selection process) to examine a wide urban space and identify interesting relationships among relevant variables for typical summer scenarios. Multi-objective optimizers involve many evaluations of two objectives (i.e., energy consumption and thermal comfort in this study) while considering many analytical constraints. This approach entails a considerably more exhaustive search of environmental variables that can help the urban planning process to mitigate the urban heat island (UHI) effect. Three quantitative metrics related to urban morphology and local climate conditions, as well as a thermal comfort indicator (the predicted mean vote), are defined and applied to Ancona to examine the potential for new sustainability in urban design. The results show that two parameters examinedcompacity and a building-scale energy indicatorcan offer insight when designing comfortable cities, while a citywide energy indicator shows that it is more difficult to find optimal solutions when dealing with the city as a whole. The research serves as a proof-of-concept and the possibility of identifying some local strategies in order to combat the UHI is verified."
1,"Recently, global warming induced climate change in several regions of the world, is leading to yield loss in agriculture sectors, especially fruit crops. Subtropical fruit trees are one of the most sensitive species affected by rising temperatures, especially longan (Dimocarpus longan Lour.). Improvements on basic knowledge about increasing temperature effects on water content and zinc in inflorescences and shoot tips improved longan fruit production. Inflorescences and shoot tips of `Poung Tong' longan were collected and the cutting area was dipped in water and carried by plastic bag to prevent water loss before placing into an artificial incubator at 40 degrees C ambient temperature with air circulation for 30 min. The control treated samples were kept at room temperature. Analysis of the zinc content in inflorescences and shoot tips was carried out by precision detection of inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Findings showed the zinc content was 30.39% above the control treatment in the inflorescences and the zinc content in the shoot tips incubated under the high temperature condition (40 degrees C ambient temperature) was 15.06% above the control treatment. In addition, the water content was also translocated into the inflorescences and the shoot tips when incubated under 40 degrees C. The amount of water increased by 7 and 9% over the control treatment in the inflorescences and the shoot tips, respectively. The changes in water content, within the smaller branches of the inflorescences, scanned by electron microscope (SEM), supports the rapid translocation ability of zinc to accumulated in the inflorescence."
1,"Hydrological drought has wide-ranging impacts on water quality, nutrient and carbon metrics, and given the uncertainty of climate change and the predicted increased frequency and intensity of drought in the future, investigations into changes induced by drought become increasingly important. This study compared physicochemical parameters (temperature, conductivity, pH and DO), nutrients (TN, NOX [NO2 + NO3], NH3 and TP) and carbon (TOC and DOC) between hydrological drought conditions (2006-2008) and hydrological normal conditions (2016-2019) at five sites along the lower Savannah River (Georgia, USA). Although we had predicted that water temperatures would increase from drought, we instead found temperature was significantly lower during drought conditions. Levels of pH and DO were significantly higher during drought. Further, TN, TOC and DOC concentrations were significantly lower during drought, but NOX concentrations were significantly higher during drought. Conductivity varied at the lower river sites, being significantly higher during drought at sites located below the city of Augusta, GA. These complex changes could be attributed to volume reductions coupled with an increase in the percentage of total flow originating from groundwater as well as limnetic reservoir inputs, persistent point source pollution, reduced natural catchment inputs and/or reduced floodplain interactions. The changes that occurred during drought may be disruptive to aquatic life, not only from reduced water quantity but also due to a scarcity of some biologically essential materials and lower food resources, combined with artificially high levels of some other potentially stressful materials."
0,"Globally, there are over 20 000 bee species (Hymenoptera: Apoidea: Anthophila) with a host of biologically fascinating characteristics. Although they have long been studied as models for social evolution, recent challenges to bee health (mainly diseases and pesticides) have gathered the attention of both public and research communities. Genome sequences of twelve bee species are now complete or under progress, facilitating the application of additional 'omic technologies. Here, we review recent developments in honey bee and native bee research in the genomic era. We discuss the progress in genome sequencing and functional annotation, followed by the enabled comparative genomics, proteomics and transcriptomics applications regarding social evolution and health. Finally, we end with comments on future challenges in the postgenomic era."
0,"Litter decomposition is a fundamental process of biogeochemical cycles and plays a critical role in regulating carbon (C) and nutrient mineralization in terrestrial ecosystems. Examining responses of litter decomposition to altered precipitation is crucial to understand terrestrial C dynamics and its feedback to climate change. To understand the effects of reduced precipitation on litter decomposition, a two-year throughfall reduction experiment was carried out in a natural evergreen broad-leaved forest in western China. Five throughfall reduction levels were investigated: control without throughfall reduction (Ctr), 5% (W1), 10% (W2), 20% (W3) and 50% throughfall reduction (W4). Throughfall reduction significantly reduced soil moisture, which was most pronounced in W3 and W4 treatments, and this was associated by significantly reduced cumulative litter mass loss and lower decomposition constants. Also, throughfall reduction significantly altered litter C, N and P dynamics. In particular in W2, W3 and W4 treatments the release of C and N was significantly reduced, whereas in W2 and W3 the immobilization of P was increased. Overall, the results suggest that future decrease in precipitation will suppress litter decomposition, whereas microbial P limitation in litter may be aggravated in broad-leaved forest ecosystems."
1,"Respiratory infectious diseases (RID) are the major form of infectious diseases in China, and are highly susceptible to climatic conditions. Current research mainly focuses on the impact of weather on RID, but there is a lack of research on the effect of El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on RID. Therefore, this paper uses the system generalized method of moments (SYS-GMM) and the data of 31 provinces in China from 2007 to 2018 to construct a dynamic panel model to empirically test the causality between ENSO and RID morbidity. Moreover, this paper considers the moderating effects of per capita disposable income and average years of education on this causality. The results show that ENSO can positively and significantly impact RID morbidity, which is 5.842% higher during El Nino years than normal years. In addition, per capita disposable income and average years of education can effectively weaken the relationship between ENSO and RID morbidity. Thus, this paper is of great significance for improving the RID early climate warning system in China and effectively controlling the spread of RID."
1,"The Succulent Karoo is characterised by a dense coverage of biological soil crusts (biocrusts) belonging to different types and successional stages. Whereas the Soebatsfontein region hosts cyanobacteria-dominated and minor amounts of lichen- and bryophyte-dominated biocrusts, the Knersvlakte comprises a rich cover of hypolithic crusts growing on the sides and undersides of quartz pebbles. Apart from dominating photosynthesizers used to classify biocrusts, each crust type hosts a rich and specific fungal and bacterial community and also diverse protists. In a remote-sensing mapping approach, soil-inhabiting biocrusts of the Soebatsfontein region covered similar to 27% of the surface area, whereas in the Knersvlakte soil-inhabiting biocrusts covered similar to 16% and hypolithic biocrusts similar to 42% of the region. Combining these data with biomass contents, results suggested that the Knersvlakte, despite somewhat harsher environmental conditions, harboured about 65% more biocrust biomass per surface area. In physiological measurements we observed that biocrusts emit the reactive nitrogen compounds nitric oxide and nitrous acid, showing water pulse-dependent emission patterns. In addition, CO2 gas fixation showed characteristic type-specific patterns depending on climatic conditions. Long-term microclimate measurements along a gradient revealed that forecasted climate and land-use change may be detrimental for biocrusts with potentially adverse effects on soil stability and overall fertility of the Succulent Karoo."
1,"An understanding of the energy exchange processes at the surface of the earth is necessary for studies of global climate change. If the climate becomes drier, as is predicted for northern mid-latitudes, it is important to know how major agricultural crops will play a role in the budget of heat and moisture. Thus. the energy balance components of sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench.] and sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), two drought-resistant crops grown in the areas where summertime drying is forecasted. were compared. Soil water content and evapotranspiration (ET) rates also were determined. Net radiation was measured with net radiometers. Soil heat flux was analyzed with heat flux plates and thermocouples. The Bowen ratio method was used to determine sensible and latent heat fluxes. Sunflower had a higher evapotranspiration rate and depleted more water from the soil than sorghum. Soil heat flux into the soil during the daytime was greater for sorghum than sunflower, which was probably the result of the more erect leaves of sorghum. Nocturnal net radiation loss from the sorghum crop was greater than that from the sunflower crop, perhaps because more heat was stored in the soil under the sorghum crop. But daytime net radiation values were similar for the two crops. The data indicated that models of climate change must differentiate nighttime net radiation of agricultural crops. Sensible heat flux was not always less (or greater) for sorghum compared to sunflower. Sunflower had greater daytime values for latent heat flux. reflecting its greater depletion of water from the soil. Evapotranspiration rates determined by the energy balance method agreed relatively well with those found by the water balance method. For example, on 8 July (43 days after planting), the ET rates found by the energy-balance and water-balance methods were 4.6 vs. 5.5 mm day for sunflower, respectively: for sorghum, these values were 4.0 vs. 3.5 mm day, respectively. If the climate does become drier. the lower soil water use and lower latent heat flux of sorghum compared to sunflower suggest that sorghum will be better adapted to the climate change."
1,"Wheat is a globally important crop and one of the big three  US field crops. But unlike the other two (maize and soybean), in the United States its development is commercially unattractive, and so its breeding takes place primarily in public universities. Troublingly, the incentive structures within these universities may be hindering genetic improvement just as climate change is complicating breeding efforts. Business as usual  in the US public wheat-breeding infrastructure may not sustain productivity increases. To address this concern, we held a multidisciplinary conference in which researchers from 12 US (public) universities and one European university shared the current state of knowledge in their disciplines, aired concerns, and proposed initiatives that could facilitate maintaining genetic improvement of wheat in the face of climate change. We discovered that climate-change-oriented breeding efforts are currently considered too risky and/or costly for most university wheat breeders to undertake, leading to a relative lack of breeding efforts that focus on abiotic stressors such as drought and heat. We hypothesize that this risk/cost burden can be reduced through the development of appropriate germplasm, relevant screening mechanisms, consistent germplasm characterization, and innovative models predicting the performance of germplasm under projected future climate conditions. However, doing so will require coordinated, longer-term, inter-regional efforts to generate phenotype data, and the modification of incentive structures to consistently reward such efforts."
1,"Stipa tenacissima L, which has long been recognised as the typical dominant perennial plant in the North-African arid rangelands is currently going into extinction in the steppic High Plains of Algeria. The vegetation and soil dynamics were analyzed at an initially dense stand. The trend between 1976 and 2006 was investigated using five reference years. Sampling was performed along a grazing gradient including a grazed steppe and an exclosure. Between 1976 and 1993, the perennial cover and soil organic matter decreased outside the exclosure, while the composition of the dominant species remained unchanged. From 1993 to 2006, the plant cover, species composition and soil showed major changes both inside and outside the exclosure and S. tenacissima disappeared completely in 2006. These changes were primarily attributed to overgrazing by sheep. More frequent and intensive droughts exacerbated the grazing intensity in a context of common and uncontrolled land use. The exclosure, implemented as a remedy, temporarily played a positive role regarding vegetation and soil conservation. In addition to severe drought, the vegetation and soil degradation and sand encroachment even inside the exclosure, created conditions that were no longer able to support the pre-existing alfa-grass ecosystem.

1,"Due to increased urbanization and global warming, cities are experiencing more heat wave (HW) events that cause extreme heat stress. To mitigate such effects, a better understanding of the impact of urban morphology on the boundary layer development is needed. This study investigates the sensitivity of mesoscale simulations using the WRF model coupled with the building effect parameterization and the building energy model (BEP-BEM) at a 1-km resolution to 1) soil moisture initializations; 2) the inclusion of site-specific urban morphology parameters; and 3) the planetary boundary layer (PBL) scheme. A HW episode that occurred in the metropolitan area of Barcelona serves as the case study. We find that the use of a high-resolution land data assimilation system (HRLDAS) to initialize soil properties results in larger temperature diurnal range, but it did not improve the performance of simulated temperatures compared to using low-resolution ERA5 data. The inclusion of site-specific urban parameters improved the representation of urban fractions, reducing the night-time overprediction of 2-m temperatures compared to using default urban parameters. Overall, the Bougeault-Lacarrere (BouLac) scheme represents the PBLheight noontime observations better than the Mellor-Yamada-Janjic (MYJ) scheme. This was related to a better representation of daytime near-surface temperatures by the BouLac scheme compared to the MYJ scheme"
1,"Community processes are now undergoing substantial reconfiguration because of climate change. Although the effects of climate change on ecosystems are currently a major concern, the issues tightly associated with winter climate change have been underrepresented. Given the importance of winter climate variables and events for determining the spatial distribution of communities and their phenological and physiological responses, and the functional roles of each species, all of which are expected to substantially influence community dis/re-assemble in the future, this review focuses on the ecological responses and consequences of terrestrial communities to changing winter climate. In particular, the effects on processes supported by biological interactions are largely undetermined. In this context, focusing on plant-soil feedback as a major interactive multi-system is worthwhile; these interactions can be disentangled through careful evaluation of the functional roles of organisms involved in the feedback (i.e., plants and soil organisms). The underlying mechanisms are indeed complex because direct (i.e., changes in physical conditions) and indirect pathways (i.e., plant-mediated influences on soil-organisms and vice versa) from winter climate change influence the functionality of future ecosystems. To face these issues, the framework of response-effect-traits deserves research priority since this can define community re-organization as the accumulated responses of individual species, which determines the stability and performance of ecosystem functioning. Thus, research that quantifies functional responses and roles of organisms under a changing climate will continue to be essential for the issues of winter climate change, which may become more serious and significant in the near future."
1,"The Brazilian Cerrado is a global biodiversity hotspot with notoriously high rates of native vegetation suppression and wildfires over the past three decades. As a result, climate change can already be detected at both local and regional scales. In this study, we used three different approaches based on independent datasets to investigate possible changes in the daytime and nighttime temperature and air humidity between the peak of the dry season and the beginning of the rainy season in the Brazilian Cerrado. Additionally, we evaluated the tendency of dew point depression, considering it as a proxy to assess impacts on biodiversity. Monthly increases of 2.2-4.0. in the maximum temperatures and 2.4-2.8. in the minimum temperatures between 1961 and 2019 were recorded, supported by all analyzed datasets which included direct observations, remote sensing, and modeling data. The warming raised the vapor pressure deficit, and although we recorded an upward trend in absolute humidity, relative humidity has reduced by similar to 15%. If these tendencies are maintained, gradual air warming will make nightly cooling insufficient to reach the dew point in the early hours of the night. Therefore, it will progressively reduce both the amount and duration of nocturnal dewfall, which is the main source of water for numerous plants and animal species of the Brazilian Cerrado during the dry season. Through several examples, we hypothesize that these climate changes can have a high impact on biodiversity and potentially cause ecosystems to collapse. We emphasize that the effects of temperature and humidity on Cerrado ecosystems cannot be neglected and should be further explored from a land use perspective."
1,"A severe drought from 2007 to 2010 resulted in the lowest river levels (1.75 m decline from average) in over 90 years of records at the end of the Murray-Darling Basin in South Australia. Due to the low river level and inability to apply irrigation, the groundwater depth on the adjacent agricultural flood plain also declined substantially (1-1.5 m) and the alluvial clay subsoils dried and cracked. Sulfidic material (pH > 4, predominantly in the form of pyrite, FeS2) in these subsoils oxidised to form sulfuric material (pH < 4) over an estimated 3300 ha on 13 floodplains. Much of the acidity in the deeply cracked contaminated soil layers was in available form (in pore water and on cation exchange sites), with some layers having retained acidity (iron oxyhydroxysulfate mineral jarosite). Post drought, the rapid raising of surface and ground water levels mobilised acidity in acid sulfate soil profiles to the floodplain drainage channels and this was transported back to the river via pumping. The drainage water exhibited low pH (2-5) with high soluble metal (Al, Co, Mn, Fe, Mn, Ni, and Zn) concentrations, in exceedance of guidelines for ecosystem protection. Irrigation increased the short-term transport of acidity, however loads were generally greater in the non-irrigation (winter) season when rainfall is highest (0.0026 tonnes acidity/ha/day) than in the irrigation (spring-summer) season (0.0013 tonnes acidity/ha/day). Measured reductions in groundwater acidity and increases in pH have been observed over time but severe acidification persisted in floodplain sediments and waters for over two years post-drought. Results from 2-dimensional modelling of the river-floodplain hydrological processes were consistent with field measurements during the drying phase and illustrated how the declining river levels led to floodplain acidification. A modelled management scenario demonstrated how river level stabilisation and limited irrigation could have prevented, or greatly lessened the severity of the acidification. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

1,"For more than a century, tree-ring research has identified relationships between climatic and ecological conditions and tree growth to describe past environments and constrain future ecosystem vulnerabilities. Tree-ring records are frequently used as environmental proxies that extend knowledge of past climate and ecology on millennial scales. Many of the most pressing global change questions facing North America concern the rate of climate change and vulnerability of ecosystems and society along the coast. The opportunities and applications in dendrochronology continue to grow with advancing methodologies, faster computational ability, and the cost-reduction of many chemical and anatomical analyses. Here, we propose that many pressing global change questions that affect coastal communities can be addressed using dendrochronological techniques. We review coastal tree-ring studies that demonstrate the utility and potential for future tree-ring studies in the northeastern, southeastern, northwestern, and southwestern North American coasts. Additionally, we show that tree-ring chronologies along the coast give insight into local and regional climate phenomena that are distinct from nearby, inland tree-ring chronologies of the same species. Lastly, we identify opportunities for coastal dendrochronology and encourage the collection of more tree-ring records that are directly impacted by coastal phenomena. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

0,"The government of the Netherlands has formulated an action programme to prepare the Dutch water systems for future changes like climate change, subsidence, and spatial developments, as these are expected to increase both frequency and damage of flood events. One of the commitments made was that all water agencies are obliged to test their regional surface water systems to new flood standards based on an acceptable probability of flooding. The question addressed in this paper is whether this type of flood standards is appropriate to ensure that cost-efficient measures are taken. A case study is used to illustrate that applying the proposed standards can lead to inefficient measures, and that a better objective is to minimize flood risk, within acceptable cost.

1,"The occurrence of two severe droughts in north-east China since 2000 has raised attention in the risk presented by droughts. This paper presents a historic drought series for Shenyang in Liaoning Province, north-east China, from 1200 CE to the present with a reconstructed long precipitation series (1906-2015) augmented with historical documentary accounts. Analysis of the instrumental series using a standardized precipitation index (SPI) and extending it using historical records has produced a combined series spanning over 8 centuries. The combined long series was analysed for patterns in drought frequency, severity and typology. Three droughts comparable to those since 2000 occur in the instrumental series during the early 20th century (i.e. 1907, 1916-1918 and 1920-1921), and coeval archival sources reveal the human impacts of these severe droughts. The archival sources demonstrate how reduced vulnerability resulting from societal and cultural changes in the early 20th century helped prevent the loss of life experienced during comparable severe droughts at the end of the 19th century (1887 and 1891). Incorporating a longer temporal perspective to drought analysis shows that onset is often earlier than is documented explicitly within the archives, and so combined SPI series for a region could provide an early warning of drought development expressed as a water deficit in the previous year. Analysis of archival data provides a rich historical description of impacts and societal responses to severe drought. The archives provide a rich historical description of drought impacts and responses at the personal and community level whilst also detailing the different roles played by communities, state and international organizations in responding to events."
1,"This study investigated the mountain food systems in the Hindu Kush Karakoram Pamir Landscape (HKPL) in Pakistan. It analyzed the impacts of climate change on agriculture and livestock and identified key opportunities which can be tapped into to improve sustainability in food systems. The study applied a multiple case studies approach and collected data from four study sites at different altitudes, using the method of slow focus group discussions, key informant interviews, and non-participant observation. Findings revealed that the contribution of local agriculture and livestock to people's food consumption has gradually declined, increasing their dependence on external food items. Local food systems are losing diversity, which has negatively impacted people's dietary diversity. The youth has lost interest in agriculture due to low productivity and profitability in a high altitude village-Misgar (approximate to 3200 m above sea level). In all sites, local people perceived mixed impacts (both positive and negative) of climate change on food systems. Climate change together with enhanced use of pesticides and inorganic fertilizers, high yielding seed, and improved farm management have positive, and climate-attributed increase in crop pest attacks has negative impact on crop productivity. Moreover, local people perceived negative impacts of climate change on pastures and water availability in traditional irrigation systems without significant influence on crop and livestock productivity. In food systems, these are needed to maximize benefits from the local potential for organic production, livestock integration, value chain development, traditional food crops, medicinal plants, and protected vegetables cultivation to reduce the vulnerability of food systems to climactic and economic shocks, and improve the sustainability."
0,"Climate change is acknowledged to directly affect not only the environment, economy, and society but also the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases, thereby impacting public health.The recent experiences with the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and Monkeypox have highlighted the complex and interconnected nature of infectious diseases, which are strongly linked to various determinants of health. Considering these challenges, adopting a new vision such as the trans-disciplinary approach appears to be imperative.This paper proposes a new theory about viruses' spread, based on a biological model, accounting for the optimisation of energy and material resources for organisms' survival and reproduction in the environment. The approach applies Kleiber's law scaling theory, originally developed in biology, to model community dynamics in cities. A simple equation can be used to model pathogen spread without accounting for each species' physiology by leveraging the superlinear scaling of variables with population size. This general theory offers several ad-vantages, including the ability to explain the rapid and surprising spread of both SARS-CoV-2 and Monkeypox. The proposed model shows similarities in the spreading processes of both viruses, based on the resulting scaling factors, and opens new avenues for research.By fostering cooperation and integrating knowledge from different disciplines to effectively tackle the multifaceted dimensions of disease outbreaks, we can work towards preventing future health emergencies."
0,"Climate change is expected to increase the frequency of above-normal atmospheric water deficits contemporaneous with periods of high temperatures. Here we explore alterations in physiology and gene expression in leaves of Coffea canephora Pierre ex A. Froehner caused by a sharp drop in relative humidity (RH) at three different temperatures. Both stomatal conductance (g(s)) and CO2 assimilation (A) measurements showed that g(s) and A values fell quickly at all temperatures after the transfer to low RH. However, leaf relative water content measurements indicated that leaves nonetheless experienced substantial water losses, implying that stomatal closure and/or resupply of water was not fast enough to stop excessive evaporative losses. At 27 and 35 degrees C, upper leaves showed significant decreases in F-v/F-m compared with lower leaves, suggesting a stronger impact on photosystem II for upper leaves, while at 42 degrees C, both upper and lower leaves were equally affected. Quantitative gene expression analysis of transcription factors associated with conventional dehydration stress, and genes involved with abscisic acid signalling, such as CcNCED3, indicated temperature-dependent, transcriptional changes during the Humidity Shock ('HuS') treatments. No expression was seen at 27 degrees C for the heat-shock gene CcHSP90-7, but it was strongly induced during the 42 degrees C 'HuS' treatment. Consistent with a proposal that important cellular damage occurred during the 42 degrees C 'HuS' treatment, two genes implicated in senescence were induced by this treatment. Overall, the data show that C. canephora plants subjected to a sharp drop in RH exhibit major, temperature-dependent alterations in leaf physiology and important changes in the expression of genes associated with abiotic stress and senescence. The results presented suggest that more detailed studies on the combined effects of low RH and high temperature are warranted."
1,"Societies worldwide make large investments in the sustainability of integrated human-freshwater systems, but uncertainty about water supplies under climate change poses a major challenge. Investments in infrastructure, water regulation, or payments for ecosystem services may boost water availability, but may also yield poor returns on investment if directed to locations where water supply unexpectedly fluctuates due to shifting climate. How should investments in water sustainability be allocated across space and among different types of projects? Given the high costs of investments in water sustainability, decision-makers are typically risk-intolerant, and considerable uncertainty about future climate conditions can lead to decision paralysis. Here, we use mathematical optimization models to find Pareto-optimal satisfaction of human and environmental water needs across a large drought-prone river basin for a range of downscaled climate projections. We show how water scarcity and future uncertainty vary independently by location, and that joint consideration of both factors can provide guidance on how to allocate water sustainability investments. Locations with high water scarcity and low uncertainty are good candidates for high-cost, high-reward investments; locations with high scarcity but also high uncertainty may benefit most from low regret investments that minimize the potential for stranded assets if water supply increases. Given uncertainty in climate projections in many regions worldwide, our analysis illustrates how explicit consideration of uncertainty may help to identify the most effective strategies for investments in the long-term sustainability of integrated human-freshwater systems."
1,"Alliaria petiolata, a strict biennial in North America, can have an annual alternating high abundance of rosettes and flowering plants. We monitored changes in abundance of rosettes and flowering plants in permanent plots (2004-2014). Three times during our study, the alternating yearly cycle was not observed (2007-2008, 2008-2009, and 2013-2014). We concluded stochastic extreme climate events (ECEs), deviating from long-term climatic data norms (10th or 90th percentile), likely caused negative organism responses. Long-term data from a local NOAA station located 25 km from our study site included monthly data (1) total precipitation, (2) number of days with >0.13 cm precipitation, and (3) mean and minimum temperatures. September 2007 met the criteria for ECEs for all monthly variables. We first observed A. petiolata on our study site in 1988, and by the early 1990s, it was abundant. To determine whether September 2007 significantly differed from other September (1984-2014), we used six variables related to drought: (1) total precipitation, (2) number of days with precipitation, (3) number of contiguous days without precipitation, (4) mean monthly temperature, (5) mean maximum daily temperature, and (6) the number of days with temperatures >30 degrees C. The first two variables likely increase plant stress as they decrease, whereas stress declines as the remaining variables decrease. We used the six variables to generate a principal component analysis (PCA) biplot. Axes 1 and 2 accounted for 74.3% of the variance. Record-breaking minimum temperatures (ECEs) for January (2009) and February-March (2014) likely reduced rosette abundance and disrupted reestablishment of alternating high abundance of rosettes and flowering plants. Our data suggest that a single ECE variable, minimum temperature, and multiple ECE variables related to drought likely had negative effects on A. petiolata."
1,"Global Historical Climate Network (GHCN) data are used to characterize changes in large-scale fall extreme precipitation in the mid-Atlantic and the northeast United States. Days with the highest regional extreme precipitation total [extreme precipitation (EP) days] are sorted into weather types based on tropical cyclone (TC), atmospheric river (AR), and extreme integrated water vapor transport (IVT) influences. Increased cumulative precipitation from EP days is attributed primarily to three sources. First, over the mid-Atlantic states, Pennsylvania, and eastern New England, large increasing trends are found in precipitation occurring on EP days attributed to TC-related weather types. These increases are due to a late-1990s increase in TC frequency, which manifests primarily as increased TC remnants in the mid-Atlantic area. Second, over New York State and central and northern New England, there are increasing trends in EP day precipitation from AR-related weather types. Finally, there is evidence of increasing extreme IVT-related precipitation in the absence of ARs and TCs. However, when taking into account prior TC influences, it is found that a combination of TC-related weather types accounts for much of the increasing EP day precipitation trend. These trends are then compared to EP day synoptic changes relating to atmospheric moisture content and transport. Results indicate that fall EP days have become warmer and moister, but that this does not necessarily translate to higher IVT because wind speeds have stayed the same or slowed. This is consistent with fall climatological changes during the 1979-2019 analysis period, including higher atmospheric water content and slowed westerlies in the vicinity of the mid-Atlantic. Significance Statement: This paper sorts days with high extreme precipitation totals in the mid-Atlantic and northeast United States fall into categories based on the presence of factors such as tropical cyclones (TCs), atmospheric rivers (ARs), and other extreme moisture transport. These days have become more frequent between 1979 and 2019, in part due to events with TC influences. However, the synoptic environment on extreme days has also changed, becoming warmer and moister. Many of the most extreme events involve combined AR and TC influences. This is important because it shows that 1) large-scale extreme precipitation has become more common and has changed synoptically and 2) interactions between tropical and non-tropical systems are a key factor for extreme events in this part of the country. Future work might investigate how changes in TC frequency, moisture transport, and jet stream patterns will affect these events in a future climate."
0,"Statistical models such as the Generalized Additive Model (GAM) and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) used to predict potential habitats or distributions of wild plants, here referred to as species distribution models (SDMs), are useful tools for large-scale and long-term impact assessments. There have been fewer studies that used SDMs to predict the impact of climate change on potential habitats of plants in Asia than in western countries. Although spatial data on plant species distributions and environmental factors such as climatic parameters are necessary for modeling, the species distribution data usually constrain such modeling studies. We built models predicting the potential habitats of four Abies species (A. mariesii, A. veitchii, A. homolepis, and A. firma) endemic to Japan using species distribution data comprising detailed location and elevation records extracted from the Phytosociological Releve Database (PRDB). We also created a model predicting the habitats of Abies nephrolepis, native to East Asia, using approximately 20-km mesh distribution data digitized from a map of its distribution in China. The potential habitat projections for the four Japanese Abies species at a ca. 1-km resolution under current and future climate conditions indicated that three species presently found at high elevations on mountains would lose large areas of habitat in Japan. The projection for A. nephrolepis at ca. 20-km resolution indicated that this species would gain more habitat area in the north but lose habitat in lowlands relative to its current distribution in northeastern China. Abies species occurring in non-habitats after climate change would decline gradually and be replaced by other plant species. Although a potential habitat projection of a plant on the East Asian continent can be performed by SDMs using low-resolution plant distribution data, SDMs based on more detailed distribution data covering the entire distribution of a species are necessary for practical conservation plans.

1,"Haemaphysalis longicornis is the only species of tick present in New Zealand which infests livestock and is also the only competent vector for Theileria orientalis. Since 2012, New Zealand has suffered from an epidemic of infectious bovine anaemia associated with T. orientalis, an obligate intracellular protozoan parasite of cattle and buffaloes. The aim of this study was to predict the spatial distribution of habitat suitability of New Zealand for the tick H. longicornis using a simple rule-based climate envelope model, to validate the model against published data and use the validated model to project an expansion in habitat suitability for H. longicornis under two alternative climate change scenarios for the periods 2046-2065 and 2081-2100, relative to the climate of 1981-2010. A rule-based climate envelope model was developed based on the environmental requirements for off-host tick survival. The resulting model was validated against a maximum entropy environmental niche model of environmental suitability for T. orientalis transmission and against a H. longicornis occurrence map. Validation was completed using the I-similarity statistic and by linear regression. The H. longicornis climate envelope model predicted that 75% of cattle farms in the North Island, 3% of cattle farms in the South Island and 54% of cattle farms in New Zealand overall have habitats potentially suitable for the establishment of H. longicornis. The validation methods showed an acceptable level of agreement between the envelope model and published data. Both of the climate change scenarios, for each of the time periods, projected only slight to moderate increases in the average farm habitat suitability scores for all the South Island regions. However, only for the West Coast, Marlborough, Tasman, and Nelson regions did these increases in environmental suitability translate into an increased proportion of cattle farms with low or high H. longicornis habitat suitability. These results will have important implications for the geographical progression of Theileria-associated bovine anaemia (TABA) in New Zealand and will also be of interest to Haemaphysalis longicornis researchers in Australia, Japan, Korea and New Zealand."
1,"In line with sustainable development principles and in order to combat climate change, which contributes to progressive soil depletion, various solutions are being sought to use treated sewage sludge as a soil amendment to improve soil quality and enrich arable soils with adequate amounts of biogenic compounds. This review article focuses on the effects of the agricultural use of biosolids on the environment. The article reviews the existing knowledge on selected emerging contaminants in treated sewage sludge and describes the impact of these pollutants on the environment and living organisms based on 183 publications selected from over 16,000 papers on related topics published over the last ten years. This study deals not only with chemical contaminants but also genetic determinants of resistance to these compounds. Current research has questioned the agricultural use of biosolids due to the presence of mutual interactions between antibiotics, heavy metals, the genetic determinants of resistance (antibiotic resistance genes - ARGs and heavy metal resistance genes - HMRGs) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs as well as the risks associated with their transfer to the environment. This study emphasizes the need for more extensive legal regulations that account for other pollutants of environmental concern (PEC), particularly in countries where sewage sludge is applied in agriculture most extensively. Future research should focus on more effective methods of eliminating PEC from sewage sludge, especially from the sludge that is used to fertilize agricultural land, because even small amounts of these micropollutants can have serious implications for the health and life of humans and animals."
1,"Global analyses show that climate change has already increased the frequency and strength of extreme weather events. The observed and remote-sensed precipitation productions have been deeply studied considering the stationary and non-stationary characteristics of extreme series. However, as these studies largely addressed the evolution of precipitation extremes at a single station, the consistency risk of extremes at multiple stations within close days has been little researched. In this paper, a multivariate frequency analysis method is proposed to reveal the exceeding and coincidence probabilities of the most dependent extreme precipitation series. First, a generalized extreme distribution, which has proved better at describing the tail behavior of extreme series, is developed to simulate the marginal distribution of rainfall extremes. Then, a mixed von Mises distribution is introduced to fit the occurrence time interval of the extreme events. Taking advantage of its flexibility in choosing arbitrary marginals, a copula is constructed to implement a joint probability analysis of extreme precipitation events at multiple stations. The upper reaches of the Yangtze River, where frequent heavy rains are the main source of the regional floods, were selected as a typical research area. Five hundred twenty-eight copula models were finally constructed by arbitrarily choosing two precipitation extreme series among the total 33 meteorological stations. The results revealed the risk of extreme rainfall occurrence once in 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, or 100 years, within a time interval of 1-90 days. The research has great significance for understanding complicated extreme events and is helpful for the disaster emergency response and management."
1,"The 1 July 2015 was the hottest July day on record (37.5 degrees C recorded at Heathrow Airport) in the United Kingdom (UK), and record-breaking temperatures were recorded across England. This short-duration heatwave (30 June-1 July 2015) affected railway services both directly, by causing asset failure or malfunction, and indirectly, by necessitating the use of emergency speed restrictions (ESRs) to reduce the likelihood of track buckling. Incidents caused by heat and lightning were recorded across the British railway network, and knock-on delays affected rail travel in regions where extreme weather did not have a direct impact. Over both days there were more than 220 000 delay-minutes. Many of these could not be attributed specifically to the weather, but 23 700 delay-minutes were due to emergency speed restrictions (ESRs) as a preventative measure to reduce the likelihood of rail buckling, 12800 to heat and 4000 to lightning incidents. All regions experienced more than twice the daily average delay-minutes on one or both days, costing an estimated 16 pound million to the national economy. Incidents on critical routes (e.g. London North Eastern connecting London and Scotland) or near critical transport nodes such as Manchester Piccadilly caused the longest delays. Under future warmer climatic conditions, heatwaves and extreme temperatures are projected to occur more frequently and the railway operator has several measures to adapt or update existing infrastructure in order to reduce the impact of heat and lightning. Alternative solutions such as low-cost sensors for real-time condition monitoring or green infrastructure for increased asset resilience should also be considered."
1,"There is public concern that large-scale disturbances to forest cover caused by insects and storm winds in the Bohemian Forest could intensify high water flows and enhance the expected flooding risks predicted in current regional climate change scenarios. We analysed stream discharge in Upper Vydra and Gro beta e Ohe, neighbouring catchments in the Bohemian Forest, the largest contiguous forested area in Central Europe. Upper Vydra, in the Sumava National Park, and Gro beta e Ohe (including the Upper Gro beta e Ohe headwater catchment in the Bavarian Forest National Park) are similar in size, but differ in land use cover and the extent of disturbed Norway spruce stands. Publicly available runoff and meteorological data (1978-2011) were examined using non-parametric trend and breakpoint analysis. Together with mapped vegetation cover changes, the results were used to address the following questions: 1) are there significant changes in the hydrological cycle and, if so, do these changes relate to 2) the extent and expansion of disturbance in forests stands and/or 3) altered precipitation dynamics and thermal conditions? We found no marked overall change in annual runoff or in annual or seasonal precipitation, but a significant increase in high flows in March. This overall trend related to the marked warming in late winter and early spring (+similar to 4 K in April, p < 0.01), irrespective of altitude and slope position. It significantly shifted the end of the snow cover period by more than three weeks to the beginning/middle of April depending on altitude, and intensified snow melt. In the Upper Grosse Ohe catchment, a significant decrease in catchment balance, the difference between the long term precipitation and runoff (-72 mm, 11%) was found when the loss of tree cover reached 30% of catchment area. Diminished evapotranspiration losses from severely disturbed stands increased groundwater recharge during summer and caused a significant rise in low flows in autumn. However, observed increases in late winter high flows were due to warming only. They could be further intensified by the increasing winter precipitation predicted under present climate change scenarios, and would therefore increase the risk of flooding at lower elevations."
0,"Managing and identifying the sources of anthropogenic stress in coastal wetlands requires an in-depth understanding of relationships between species diversity and human activities. Empirical and experimental studies provide clear evidence that coastal reclamation can have profound impacts on marine organisms, but the focus of such studies is generally on comparative or laboratory research. We developed a compound intensity index (reclamation intensity index, RI) on hybrid coastal reclamation, to quantify the impacts of reclamation on coastal ecosystems. We also made use of mean annual absolute changes to a number of biotic variables (biodiversity, species richness, biomass of total macrozoobenthos, and species richness and biomass of Polychaeta, Mollusca, Crustacea, and Echinodermata) to determine Hedges'd index, which is a measure of the potential effects of coastal reclamation. Our results showed that there was significant difference of coastal reclamation intensity between Yellow Sea, East China Sea and South China Sea, the biological changes in effect sizes of the three regions differed greatly over time. Our modelling analyses showed that hybrid coastal reclamation generally had significant negative impacts on species diversity and biomass of macrozoobenthos. These relationships varied among different taxonomic groups and included both linear and nonlinear relationships. The results indicated that a high-intensity of coastal reclamation contributed to a pronounced decline in species diversity and biomass, while lower-intensity reclamation, or reclamation within certain thresholds, resulted in a small increase in species diversity and biomass. These results have important implications for biodiversity conservation and the ecological restoration of coastal wetlands in face of the intensive reclamation activities."
1,"Amphibians are vital components of global biodiversity and fulfil diverse ecological roles, including insect population control and serving as environmental health indicators. However, there is a concerning decline in amphibian populations globally due to factors such as habitat loss, climate change, and emerging diseases. Concurrently, the issue of microplastic pollution has gained prominence because of its potential to harm aquatic ecosystems. Microplastics, derived from various sources, endanger aquatic organisms, especially amphibians during their sensitive larval stages. In this study, we examined the prevalence of microplastic pollution in the larval stages of 10 amphibian species, covering both tailed (Urodela) and tailless (Anura) amphibians. We observed a significant correlation between amphibian species identity, the extent of artificial land cover, and the degree of microplastic contamination in larvae. Notably, our results indicate interspecific differences in microplastic bioaccumulation. Furthermore, this research is the first to demonstrate a positive correlation between microplastic pollution in amphibian larvae and anthropogenic pressure. Our findings add to the expanding literature underscoring the intricate interplay between human activities and aquatic ecosystem health."
0,"A normative framework for the governance of groundwater is emerging at the global level. However, existing analyses have not comprehensively covered all the governance texts that have a bearing on transboundary groundwater resources or looked at them from the perspective of sustainable groundwater governance. Therefore, this paper responds to the questions: What are the global governance texts (including international laws) applicable to groundwater resources; to which forms of the resource do they apply; which principles have been included over time; and what are the implications for sustainable development of groundwater resources now and in the future? The analysis highlights key groundwater concepts, discusses twelve global groundwater governance texts and the thirty principles therein, classifies the principles into ideal-typical categories based on the sustainable development concept; and assesses the gaps and conflicts between the principles and texts. The paper has three key findings. First, groundwater governance is rapidly evolving and there are a number of principles available to promote sustainable development. Second, however, these collective principles do not adequately address (a) the link with all water resources; (b) the potential impact of climate change on water resources; and (c) the impact of trade on equitable sharing of groundwater and protection of groundwater-related ecosystems. Third, to the extent that this collection of principles can contribute to sustainable development, they are inconsistently included in the legally binding groundwater governance texts. Therefore, much progress is needed to ensure a global normative framework that can guide the sustainable governance of groundwater resources."
1,"Preparation of the country's flora is very challenging until baseline information on the flora of all district or upazila is available. The purpose of this inventory was to record angiosperm plant species available in the different habitats of Bagatipara upazila, which is located in the eastern part of Rajshahi district. The traditional taxonomic method was applied for plant sample collection in different seasons of the year 2022 and the identification of the collected samples. This research resulted in the recording of a total of 377 species in 92 families. Among them, 310 species were from Magnoliopsida, and 67 were from Liliopsida. Asteraceae and Poaceae were the leading families of Magnoliopsida and Liliopsida, respectively. One-fourth of the total plant species were exotic, and more than half were valuable medicinal species. Artocarpus lacucha , Bridelia stipularis , Callicarpa longifolia , Eranthemum pulchellum , Oroxylum indicum , Potentilla supina , Sterculia foetida , and Terminalia arjuna were locally found rare. Threats such as climate change, expansion of arable land and pisciculture, use of herbicides, over exploitation, clearing brushwood, and unplanned construction activities have been identified. The present study concludes that the floristic composition of this area is still rich, though the area is facing some threats. Therefore, we strongly recommend adopting effective and adequate measures for sustainable conservation and monitoring of the biodiversity of this area."
1,"Marginal seas of the Arctic Ocean are well recognized as one of the richest ecosystems in the world's ocean, being at the same time the most vulnerable to climate change. Such vulnerability affects the distribution of water masses, thus influences the pelagic species dispersal and local diversity. For certain reasons some plankton species can be used as indicators of water mass distribution. Although the use of copepods and chaetognaths in such a manner is well documented, still little is known about the potential of pelagic Coelenterata as possible indicator species; they are still poorly investigated in this part of the Arctic Ocean. Therefore, a survey of these gelatinous animals was conducted in a transect between the Norwegian, Greenland, and Barents Seas in summer 2011. A total of 21 taxa were encountered and the most abundant was Aglantha digitale. Species distribution coupled with hydrological analysis of the investigated area enabled us to establish the water mass indicator taxa. Therefore, A. digitale was connected with the Atlantic Water Mass, while Bougainvillia superciliaris and large numbers of ctenophores were correlated with the Arctic Water Mass. The results presented herein may provide the basis for developing new tools to analyze changes in the Arctic Ocean."
1,"Some of the climate-sensitive infections (CSIs) affecting humans are zoonotic vector-borne diseases, such as Lyme borreliosis (BOR) and tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), mostly linked to various species of ticks as vectors. Due to climate change, the geographical distribution of tick species, their hosts, and the prevalence of pathogens are likely to change. A recent increase in human incidences of these CSIs in the Nordic regions might indicate an expansion of the range of ticks and hosts, with vegetation changes acting as potential predictors linked to habitat suitability. In this paper, we study districts in Fennoscandia and Russia where incidences of BOR and TBE have steadily increased over the 1995-2015 period (defined as 'Well Increasing districts'). This selection is taken as a proxy for increasing the prevalence of tick-borne pathogens due to increased habitat suitability for ticks and hosts, thus simplifying the multiple factors that explain incidence variations. This approach allows vegetation types and strengths of correlation specific to the WI districts to be differentiated and compared with associations found over all districts. Land cover types and their changes found to be associated with increasing human disease incidence are described, indicating zones with potential future higher risk of these diseases. Combining vegetation cover and climate variables in regression models shows the interplay of biotic and abiotic factors linked to CSI incidences and identifies some differences between BOR and TBE. Regression model projections up until 2070 under different climate scenarios depict possible CSI progressions within the studied area and are consistent with the observed changes over the past 20 years."
1,"Prolonged summer droughts due to climate change are expected for this century, but little is known about the effects of drying and wetting on biogenic trace-gas fluxes of forest soils. Here, the response of CO2, N2O, NO, and CH4 fluxes from temperate forest soils towards drying-wetting events has been investigated, using undisturbed soil columns from a Norway spruce forest in the Fichtelgebirge, Germany. Two different types of soil columns have been used for this study to quantify the contribution of organic and mineral horizons to the total fluxes: (1) organic horizons (O) and (2) organic and mineral soil horizons (O+M). Three drying-wetting treatments with different rewetting intensities (8, 20, and 50 mm of irrigation d(-1)) have been compared to a constantly moist control to estimate the influence of rainfall intensity under identical drying conditions and constant temperature (+15 degrees C). Drought significantly reduced CO2, N2O, and NO fluxes in most cycles. Following rewetting, CO2 fluxes quickly recovered back to control level in the O columns but remained significantly reduced in the O+M columns with total CO2 fluxes from the drying-wetting treatment ranging approx. 80% of control fluxes. Fluxes of N2O and NO remained significantly reduced in both O and O+M columns even after rewetting, with cumulative fluxes from drying-wetting treatments ranging between 20% and 90% of the control fluxes depending on gas and cycle. Fluxes of CH4 were small in all treatments and seem to play no significant role in this soil. No evidence for the release of additional gas fluxes due to drying-wetting was found. The intensity of rewetting had no significant effect on the CO2, N2O, NO, and CH4 fluxes, suggesting that the length of the drought period is more important for the emission of these gases. We can therefore not confirm earlier findings that fluxes of CO2, N2O, and NO during wetting of dry soil exceed the fluxes of constantly moist soil."
1,"Understanding how growth trajectories of calcifying invertebrates are affected by changing climate requires acclimation experiments that follow development across life-history transitions. In a long-term acclimation study, the effects of increased acidification and temperature on survival and growth of the tropical sea urchin Tripneustes gratilla from the early juvenile (5 mm test diameter-TD) through the developmental transition to the mature adult (60 mm TD) were investigated. Juveniles were reared in a combination of three temperature and three pH/pCO(2) treatments, including treatments commensurate with global change projections. Elevated temperature and pCO(2)/pH both affected growth, but there was no interaction between these factors. The urchins grew more slowly at pH 7.6, but not at pH 7.8. Slow growth may be influenced by the inability to compensate coelomic fluid acid-base balance at pH 7.6. Growth was faster at +3 and +6 degrees C compared to that in ambient temperature. Acidification and warming had strong and interactive effects on reproductive potential. Warming increased the gonad index, but acidification decreased it. At pH 7.6 there were virtually no gonads in any urchins regardless of temperature. The T. gratilla were larger at maturity under combined near-future warming and acidification scenarios (+3 degrees C/pH 7.8). Although the juveniles grew and survived in near-future warming and acidification conditions, chronic exposure to these stressors from an early stage altered allocation to somatic and gonad growth. In the absence of phenotypic adjustment, the interactive effects of warming and acidification on the benthic life phases of sea urchins may compromise reproductive fitness and population maintenance as global climatic change unfolds."
1,"Coral reef islands are among the most vulnerable environments on Earth to climate change because they are low lying and largely constructed from unconsolidated sediments that can be readily reworked by waves and currents. These sediments derive entirely from surrounding coral reef and reef flat environments and are thus highly sensitive to ecological transitions that may modify reef community composition and productivity. How such modifications - driven by anthropogenic disturbances and on-going and projected climatic and environmental change - will impact reef island sediment supply and geomorphic stability remains a critical but poorly resolved question. Here, we review the unique ecological-geomorphological linkages that underpin this question and, using different scenarios of environmental change for which reef sediment production responses can be projected, explore the likely resilience of different island types. In general, sand-dominated islands are likely to be less resilient than those dominated by rubble grade material. However, because different islands typically have different dominant sediment constituents (usually either coral, benthic foraminifera or Halimeda) and because these respond differently to individual ecological disturbances, island resilience is likely to be highly variable. Islands composed of coral sands are likely to undergo major morphological change under most near-future ecological change scenarios, while those dominated by Halimeda may be more resilient. Islands composed predominantly of benthic foraminifera (a common state through the Pacific region) are likely to exhibit varying degrees of resilience depending upon the precise combination of ecological disturbances faced. The study demonstrates the critical need for further research bridging the ecological-geomorphological divide to understand: (1) sediment production responses to different ecological and environmental change scenarios; and (2) dependant landform vulnerability."
1,"A semi-distributed hydrological model and reservoir optimization algorithm are used to evaluate the potential impacts of climate change on existing and proposed reservoirs in the Sonora River Basin, Mexico. Inter-annual climatic variability, a bimodal precipitation regime and climate change uncertainties present challenges to water resource management in the region. Hydrological assessments are conducted for three meteorological products during a historical period and a future climate change scenario. Historical (1990-2000) and future (2031-2040) projections were derived from a mesoscale model forced with boundary conditions from a general circulation model under a high emissions scenario. The results reveal significantly higher precipitation, reservoir inflows, elevations and releases in the future relative to historical simulations. Furthermore, hydrological seasonality might be altered with a shift toward earlier water supply during the North American monsoon. The proposed infrastructure would have a limited ability to ameliorate future conditions, with more benefits in a tributary with lower flood hazard. These projections of the impacts of climate change and its interaction with infrastructure should be of interest to water resources managers in arid and semi-arid regions. [GRAPHICS] Editor D.

1,"Himalayan glaciers have shown a retreating trend since the Little Ice Age (LIA) in response to climate change. As glaciers are crucial for water security and ecological sustainability, it becomes necessary to map and monitor the glacial status from time to time. The present study is focused on the study of Haptal glacier located in the Bhuzas sub-basin of Kishtwar district of Jammu and Kashmir (UT), India, between the Pir-Panjal and Greater Himalayan range using satellite data. Results revealed that the glacier retreated continuously at progressive rates between 1980 and 2020, with an annual retreat rate of 28.25 +/- 1.85 m a(-1). During 1999-2009, the highest (67.93 +/- 2.8 m a(-1)) retreat rate was observed. Maximum surface velocity was estimated during 1999-2000 (38.5 +/- 4.7 m a(-1)), while the glacier experienced the minimum surface velocity during 2019-2020 (32.5 +/- 3.7 m a(-1)). The glacier has lost its area (22.60 +/- 8.18%), glacial length (10.95 +/- 0.7%), and glacier ice volume (1.47 +/- 0.56 km(3); 29.63 +/- 11.47%) during the study period. Modelled mean ice thickness using Glabtop2 for the glacier is estimated at 129.28 +/- 13 m. The accumulation area values showed a decreasing trend of 10.89 +/- 0.56 km(2) to 8.15 +/- 0.3 km(2), indicating a change of 25.05 +/- 5.8% between 1999 and 2020. Upward migration of snow line altitude from 5148 m (1999) to 5198 m (2020) indicates enhanced melting and glacier loss during the study period. The study further revealed that there is an overall decreasing trend in specific mass balance."
1,"The dogma surrounding carbon assimilation has it that, due to their highly effective CO2-concentrating mechanisms, cyanobacteria will always out-perform, for example, green algae where inorganic carbon is in short supply. Working on the cyanobacterial genus Microcystis, Ji et al. (2017) now suggest this might not always be true, with possible improved performance with rises in atmospheric (and hence dissolved) CO2. Many cyanobacteria form extensive toxic blooms that present significant health risks and economic costs: how they will react in a future world with elevated CO2 and temperature is thus of intense interest for water management."
1,"Ethylene is synthesized at accelerated rate in response to stress conditions, and regarded as a stress hormone that inhibits overall plant growth. Apparently, the amount of ethylene can be reduced by using silver thiosulfate (STS) or bacteria containing 1-amino-cyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase. In this study, we examined whether different concentrations of STS differently prevent legume growth under various environment stress conditions, and whether co-inoculation of mungbean (Vigna radiata (L.) R. Wilczek) by Bradyrhizobium and rhizobacteria containing ACC deaminase also alleviates legume stress. Mungbean is one of the most responsive plants among tested legume species, and different varieties of mungbean also respond differently to STS. Stress conditions and inappropriate concentrations of STS affect plant growth and symbiosis, while a suitable concentration of STS supports plant growth under stress conditions. Three isolates of bacteria containing ACC deaminase, Enterobacter sp. ACC1, Enterobacter sp. ACC2, and Chryseobacterium sp. ACC3, were selected according to their ACC deaminase activity and resistance abilities to high temperature, drought, and salt stress conditions. Interestingly, the gene encoding ACC deaminase, acdS, of selected ACC deaminase bacteria was highly induced when the cell culture was exposed to stress conditions. It coincided with co-inoculation of plants by Bradyrhizobium and rhizobacteria containing ACC deaminase. This co-inoculation obviously alleviated the stress of plants growing under stress conditions. These results revealed the role of bacteria containing ACC deaminase that can adjust its expression of ACC deaminase to different levels of stress conditions, which will be useful in agriculture under global warming."
1,"Bioerosion on inshore reefs is expected to increase with global climate change reducing reef stability and accretionary potential. Most studies investigating bioerosion have focused on external grazers, such as parrotfish and urchins, whose biomass is more easily measured. Yet, cryptic endolithic bioeroders such as macroboring (worms, sponges and bivalves) and microboring taxa (fungus and algae) have the potential to be the dominant source of reef erosion, especially among inshore reef systems exposed to increased nutrient supply. We measured bioerosion rates of bioeroder functional groups (microborers, macroborers, and grazers), and their response to environmental parameters (temperature, light, turbidity, chlorophyll a), as well as habitat variables (coral cover, turfing algae, macroalgae) across two inshore turbid reefs of north Western Australia. Total bioerosion rates were low (0.163 +/- 0.012 kg m(-2) year(-1)) likely due to low light and nutrient levels. Macroborers were the dominant source of bioerosion and were positively correlated with turfing algae cover, highlighting the role of turf-grazing fish on endolithic bioerosion rates. Overall low bioerosion rates suggest that despite the reduced coral cover and carbonate production, these reefs may still maintain positive reef accretion rates, at least under current environmental conditions. However, an improved understanding of relationships between environmental drivers, habitat and grazing pressure with bioeroding communities is needed to improve predictions of reef carbonate loss with future climate change."
1,"A key challenge to environmental flow assessment in many rivers is to evaluate how much of the discharge flow should be retained in the river in order to maintain the integrity and valued features of riverine ecosystems. With the increasing impact of climate change and human activities on riverine ecosystems, the natural flow regime paradigm in many rivers has become non-stationary conditions, which is a new challenge to the assessment of environmental flow. This study presents a useful framework to (1) detect change points in runoff time series using two statistical methods (Mann-Kendall test method and heuristic segmentation method), (2) adjust data of the changed period against the original flow series into a stationary condition using a procedure of reconstruction; and (3) incorporate inter- and intra-annual streamflow variability with adjusted streamflow to evaluate environmental flow. The Jialing to Han inter-basin water transfer project was selected as the case study. Results indicate that a change point of 1994 was identified, revealing that the stationarity of annual streamflow series is invalid. The variations of reconstructed streamflow series are roughly consistent with original streamflow series, especially in the maximum/minimum values and rise/fall rates, but the mean value of reconstructed streamflow series is increased. The reconstructed streamflow series would further serve to eliminate the non-stationary of original streamflow, and incorporating the inter- and intra-annual variability would upgrade the ecosystem fitness. Selecting different criteria for the conservation of riverine ecosystems can have significantly different consequences, and we should not focus on the protection of specific objectives that will inevitably affect other aspects. This study provides a useful framework for environmental flow assessment and can be applied to a wide range of instream flow management approaches to protect the riverine ecosystem."
1,"In Finland, a recent ecological classification of surface waters showed that the rivers and coastal waters need attention to improve their ecological state. We combined eco-hydrological and empirical models to study chlorophyll-a concentration as an indicator of eutrophication in a small agricultural river. We used a modified story-and-simulation method to build three storylines for possible changes in future land use due to climate change and political change. The main objective in the first storyline is to stimulate economic activity but also to promote the sustainable and efficient use of resources. The second storyline is based on the high awareness but poor regulation of environmental protection, and the third is to survive as individual countries instead of being part of a unified Europe. We assumed trade of agricultural products to increase to countries outside Europe. We found that chlorophyll-a concentration in the river depended on total phosphorus concentration. In addition, there was a positive synergistic interaction between total phosphorus and water temperature. In future storylines, chlorophyll-a concentration increased due to land use and climate change. Climate change mainly had an indirect influence via increasing nutrient losses from intensified agriculture. We found that well-designed agri-environmental measures had the potential to decrease nutrient loading from fields, as long as the predicted increase in temperature remained under 2 degrees C. However, we were not able to achieve the nutrient reduction stated in current water protection targets. In addition, the ecological status of the river deteriorated. The influence of temperature on chlorophyll-a growth indicates that novel measures for shading rivers to decrease water temperature may be needed in the future. (C) 2019 The Authors.

1,"Global climatic change may cause changes in regional precipitation that have important implications for forest growth in the southern United States. In 1993, a stand-level experiment was initiated on Walker Branch Watershed, Tennessee, to study the sensitivity of forest saplings and large trees to changes in soil water content. Soil water content was manipulated by gravity-driven transfer of precipitation throughfall from a dry treatment plot (-33%) to a wet treatment plot (+33%). A control plot was included. Each plot was 6400 m(2). Measurements of stem diameter and observations of mortality were made on large trees and saplings of Acer rubrum L., Cornus florida L., Liriodendron tulipifera L., Nyssa sylvatica Marsh, Quercus alba L. and Quercus prinus L. every 2 weeks during six growing seasons. Saplings of C. florida and A. rubrum grew faster and mortality was less on the wet plot compared with the dry and control plots, through 6 years of soil water manipulation. Conversely, diameter growth of large trees was unaffected by the treatments. However, tree diameter growth averaged across treatments was affected by year-to-year changes in soil water status. Growth in wet years was as much as 2-3 times greater than in dry years. Relationships between tree growth, phenology and soil water potential were consistent among species and quantitative expressions were developed for application in models. These field growth data indicate that differences in seasonal patterns of rainfall within and between years have greater impacts on growth than percentage changes in rainfall applied to all rainfall events."
1,"Mean monthly streamflow from 51 hydrometric stations corresponding to undisturbed independent Romanian watersheds, were analysed for trends with the Mann-Kendall nonparametric test for a period of 30 years (1976-2005). We found substantial changes in seasonality, with more than half of the stations presenting decreasing trends at the end of spring and in the early summer streamflow; from April to July the trends are exclusively downward, while during autumn, the streamflow is increasing. No change has been found for August and December. In February and March the trends are mixed and their percentage is rather low (under 20%). On annual basis only the downward trends are statistically significant."
1,"Crop loss due to drought is a complex issue, because it changes according to the drought intensity and duration, and the developmental stage of the plants when drought occurs. In order to assess the drought-induced decline in crop harvest, drought variability and the yield sensitivity of winter wheat, maize, sugar beet, and sunflower to drought during their growing seasons is investigated in the Republic of Moldova. This is then used as an example of the response of non-irrigated crops to increasing drought tendency in south-eastern Europe. The quantification of drought was done by using the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) at 1- to 12-month lags during the period from 1951 to 2012. The relationship between drought at various time scales and the standardized yield residuals series (SYRS) for individual crops over the country and the Balti chernozem steppe of Moldova (represented by Balti experimental site) for the 1962-2012 farming years were investigated. In order to detect the trends and the shifts in the SPEI time series over 62 years, the non-parametric, Mann-Kendall and Pettitt tests were used for each month of the year to cover the main life cycle of the crops. The trend analysis of agricultural drought emphasizes an increasing trend from June to October, and becomes significant in the southern region at the 95% level during July to September. The SPEI highlights the main periods of dry/wet persistence and the regional characteristics of drought which are present in the Southern region, and make this region more prone to severe drought persistence, mostly during the last decade. Drought during the plant reproductive stages may significantly reduce grain yield potential, the relation between the SYRS and the SPEI explaining up to 62% of the low-yield variability."
1,"Study region: The Yangtze River Basin Study focus: To accurately quantify the impact of climate change and human activities on the hydrological regime, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models for meteorology-runoff simulation are constructed for the multi-year average monthly flow process. The Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration (IHA) method is used to quantitatively evaluate the hydrological processes in the watershed. Additionally, the grey relational analysis method is employed to explore key indicators affecting the ecological effects of fish. New hydrological insights for the region: The streamflow of the Yangtze River mainstem and its seven tributaries increases as the distance from the river mouth decreases. The degree of hydrological changes in various basins is moderate (33-66%). Except for the Jialing River, Wu River, and Poyang Lake, the streamflow changes in other basins are mainly influenced by human activities. Among them, Yichang is most affected by human activities (75.43%), while Wu River is most affected by climate change (67.05%). The rate of land use development has reached 116.9% over the past 20 years, and vegetation coverage has been increasing at a linear rate of 0.003 per year, Summer rainfall is significantly positively correlated with flow, while temperature is significantly negatively correlated. The Three Gorges Dam has reduced the spawning scale of fish and identified October runoff as the key indicator. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the response of watershed water resources and ecological effects."
1,"Climate change and land use change pose a threat to the world's biodiversity and have significant impacts on the geographic distribution and composition of many bird species, but little is known about how they affect threatened large-sized waterbird species that rely on agricultural landscapes. To address this gap, we investigated how climate and land use changes influence the distribution and nesting habitats of the globally vulnerable Lesser Adjutant (Leptoptilos javanicus) in Nepal. Between 2012 and 2023, we collected distribution data from 24 districts and nesting site information from 18 districts. In a nation-wide breeding survey conducted in 2020, we docu-mented a total of 581 fledglings from 346 nests in 109 colonies. The ensemble model predicted a current potential distribution of 15% (21,637 km2) and a potential nesting habitat of 13% (19,651 km2) for the species in Nepal. The highest predicted current suitable distribution and nesting habitat was in Madhesh Province, while none was predicted in Karnali Province. The majority of this predicted distributional and nesting habitat falls on agricul-tural landscapes (>70%). Our model showed a likely range expansion of up to 15% (21,573 km2) for the dis-tribution and up to 12% (17,482 km2) for the nesting habitat under SSP5-8.5 scenarios for the 2070s. The range expansion is expected to occur mainly within the current distribution and breeding range (Tarai and some regions of Siwalk), particularly in Lumbini and Sudurpashchim provinces, and extend to the northern portions (Siwalik and Mid-hill regions) in other provinces. However, the current Protected Areas and Important Bird and Biodi-versity Areas are inadequate for providing optimal habitats for the species. Although the model suggests range expansion, the use of such novel habitats is primarily contingent on the availability and protection of large-sized trees (particularly Bombax ceiba, observed in 65% of colonies) in agricultural regions where nesting occurs. Therefore, our research suggests that agricultural landscapes should be prioritized in management plans for the conservation of the Lesser Adjutant in Nepal."
1,"Cities consume more than 67% of global primary energy, the production of which results in approximately three-quarters of global CO2 emissions, exacerbating the global warming trend and related extreme weather events and natural disasters. Therefore, it is critical for cities to use existing and new sources of energy efficiently and effectively. This paper introduces a methodology that can combine sustainable energy planning with economic analysis, proposing a form of sustainable urban energy planning that could reduce energy consumption with the minimum economic cost. Taking a postindustrial city (Shenzhen, China) as an example, this paper defines four scenarios by which to analyze future projections of energy generation and consumption from 2015 to 2030 based on the Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning System model. Also developed are Sankey maps for the energy flow from the energy supply to demand sectors for different scenarios. The results show that energy efficiency improvement and energy structure upgrade policies implemented in Shenzhen would have a significant impact on its energy system. Energy consumption is projected to increase steadily up to 2030 under each scenario except for the Peak Scenario, but with different growth rates. Electricity generation in all scenarios is supposed to expand by 2030 and sustainable electricity (such as distributed photovoltaic power, waste-to-energy power, and Combined Cooling, Heating, and Power) will play an important role in the Energy structure upgrade and Peak scenarios."
0,"Distributions of related species along environmental gradients provide ecologists with insights into factors that limit distributions of species. We apply this approach to two species of kangaroo rats. A survey in 1983 showed that Dipodomys merriami is replaced by D. panamintinus at the tops of elevational gradients in parts of the Mojave Desert where both species occur. Over the 17 y since the initial survey we have conducted six additional censuses along one such gradient. In years of high population densities D.,merriami is more abundant at low and D. panamintinus at high elevations along this gradient. Following periods of drought, however, when population densities are reduced overall, D. merriami expands upward along the gradient, whereas D. panamintinus becomes restricted to even higher elevations. This pattern suggests that D. merriami normally is restricted to lower elevations by competition from the larger D. panamintinus, and experiences competitive release when the latter is at low density. The distribution of D. panamintinus, in contrast, responds to changes with elevation in primary productivity or in physical factors, rather than to competition from D. merriami Because of relatively large body mass, individuals of D. panamintinus may be restricted to higher elevations, particularly in drought years, because primary productivity at these elevations suffices to support their metabolic requirements. This interpretation of limits to distribution has implications for conservation of these and similar species especially under impending climate change."
1,"Protecting water resources for expanding human enterprise while conserving valued natural habitat is among the greatest challenges of the 21st century. Global change processes such as climate change and intensive land use pose significant threats to water resources, particularly in arid regions where potential evapotranspiration far exceeds annual rainfall. Potentially compounding these shortages is the progressive expansion of non-native plant species in riparian areas along streams, canals and rivers in geographically arid regions. This paper sets out to identify when and where non-native riparian plant species are likely to have the highest potential impact on hydrologic fluxes of arid and semiarid river systems. We develop an ecophysiological framework that focuses on two main criteria: (1) examination of the physiological traits that promote non-native species establishment and persistence across environmental gradients, and (2) assessment of where and to what extent hydrologic fluxes are potentially altered by the establishment of introduced species at varying scales from individual plants, to small river reaches, to entire river basins. We highlight three non-native plant species that currently dominate southwestern United States riparian forests. These include tamarisk (Tamarix spp.), Russian olive (Eleagnus angustifolia), and Russian knapweed (Acroptilon repens). As with other recent reviews, we suspect that in many cases the removal of these, and other non-native species will have little or no impact on either streamflow volume or groundwater levels. However, we identify potential exceptions where the expansion of non-native plant species could have significant impact on ecohydrologic processes associated with southwestern United States river systems. Future research needs are outlined that will ultimately assist land managers and policy makers with restoration and conservation priorities to preserve water resources and valued riparian habitat given limited economic resources."
1,"Shallow-water sponges are often cited as being 'climate change winners' due to their resiliency against climate change effects compared to other benthic taxa. However, little is known of the impacts of climate change on deep-water sponges. The deep-water glass sponge Vazella pourtalesii is distributed off eastern North America, forming dense sponge grounds with enhanced biodiversity on the Scotian Shelf off Nova Scotia, Canada. While the strong natural environmental variability that characterizes these sponge grounds suggests this species is resilient to a changing environment, its physiological limitations remain unknown, and the impact of more persistent anthropogenic climate change on its distribution has never been assessed. We used Random Forest and generalized additive models to project the distribution of V. pourtalesii in the northwest Atlantic using environmental conditions simulated under moderate and worst-case CO2 emission scenarios. Under future (2046-2065) climate change, the suitable habitat of V. pourtalesii will increase up to 4 times its present-day size and shift into deeper waters and higher latitudes, particularly in its northern range where ocean warming will serve to improve the habitat surrounding this originally sub-tropical species. However, not all areas projected as suitable habitat in the future will realistically be populated, and the reduced likelihood of occurrence in its core habitat on the Scotian Shelf suggests that the existing Vazella sponge grounds may be negatively impacted. An effective monitoring programme will require tracking changes in the density and distribution of V. pourtalesii at the margins between core habitat and where losses and gains were projected."
1,"Climate change threatens the livelihoods of Sub-Saharan African farmers through increased droughts. Livestock donation programs offer a potential solution, but their effectiveness under climate stress remains unclear. This study assesses the economic viability of integrating climate-smart technologies (cowsheds and biogas plants) into these programs in Rwanda. Using a stochastic benefit-cost analysis from the beneficiary perspective, we evaluate the net gains for households receiving heifers compared to the current program. Our findings reveal that integrating climate-smart technologies significantly enhances economic viability. Households with cows and climate-smart technologies can possibly realise net benefits 3.5 times higher than the current program, with benefit-cost ratios reaching 5:1. Beyond economic benefits, adopting biogas reduces deforestation, greenhouse gas emissions, and respiratory illness risks. This study demonstrates that integrating climate-smart technologies into livestock donation programs can generate positive economic, environmental, and health benefits, leading to more resilient and sustainable smallholder systems. However, overcoming implementation challenges requires tailored policy packages addressing local barriers."
1,"Climate change has become an environmental issue of utmost importance, and one that will challenge existing water resource management practices in many ways. The Huaihe River, one of China's major rivers, is frequently subject to flooding and drought and, for the purposes of assessing the implications of climate change on water resources in the Huaihe River Basin, the variable infiltration capacity (VIC) model with a resolution of 0.5 degrees x0.5 degrees was calibrated using data from 11 well-gauged subbasins. The model parameters from the well-gauged stations were then transferred to poorly gauged areas according to similarities in, for example, climate conditions and soil texture. The calibrated VIC model was subsequently used to study the potential impacts of three climate change scenarios on basin runoff, taking projected runoff for 1961-1990 as the baseline. In general, the results showed that although the annual runoff will likely increase across the basin under the different scenarios, regional flooding and regional shortage in water resources will be exacerbated under the impacts of global warming.

1,"To facilitate the adaptive management of subalpine ecosystems in the Korean Peninsula under climate change conditions, we identified the climatic factors that determine the distribution of two dominant subalpine firs (Abies koreana and A. nephrolepis). We also identified sustainable and vulnerable habitats for these species inside and outside of current protected areas under climate change scenarios. The minimum temperature of the coldest month, and the amount of precipitation in the warmest quarter were the most important climatic variables that determined the distribution of these two Abies species. Potential habitats for A. koreana and A. nephrolepis were predicted to decrease to 3.3% and 36.4% of the current areas due to climate change, irrespective of whether inside or outside the protected areas. It was predicted that the potential habitats for A. nephrolepis would be maintained in the northern part of the Korean Peninsula, and sustainable potential habitats outside the protected areas were predicted in central parts of the Korean Peninsula. The potential habitats for A. koreana were predicted to disappear from Is. Jeju and shrink significantly in the Korean Peninsula. These results suggest that, in central parts of the Korean Peninsula, revision of protected areas would be effective in preserving A. nephrolepis under conditions of future climate change. In contrast, revision of protected areas would be insufficient to conserve A. koreana due to their high vulnerability and limited populations. Active management is required to ensure the survival of A. koreana under future climate conditions."
0,"Arthropods play vital roles in ecosystem functions, yet their distribution is subjected to environmental factors. Hence, this study investigates the impact of habitat features on arthropod communities within cocoa smallholdings under different farming practices: agroforestry and monoculture systems. We conducted arthropod sampling using yellow sticky traps and assessed the habitat features at each plantation twice to capture temporal variations in arthropod populations. The study recorded 2945 individual arthropods belonging to eight different functional groups. The most abundant functional group was saprophagous, followed by phytophagous, parasitoid, predator, mycetophagous, frugivorous, palynivore, and nectarivorous group. Using Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs), we found that the abundance of phytophagous and predatory arthropods increases with leaf litter, while it decreases with saprophagous arthropods. Our findings suggest that tree-crop diversification within cocoa smallholdings can play a significant role in preserving higher arthropod biodiversity, particularly when these smallholdings remain free from chemical insecticide use. Canopy cover was also found to positively affect the variability of arthropods indicating that it is a crucial factor affecting arthropod biodiversity. This study underscores the significance of integrating agroforestry systems into cocoa production landscapes, particularly those utilizing agrochemicals, to support diverse arthropod communities and promote sustainable cocoa production."
1,"It is important to investigate the propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought and its potential influence factors, which helps to reveal drought propagation process, thereby being helpful for drought mitigation. In this study, Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Standardized Streamflow Index (SSI) were adopted to characterize meteorological and hydrological droughts, respectively. The propagation time from meteorological to hydrological drought was investigated. The cross wavelet analysis was utilized to examine the correlations between hydrological and meteorological droughts in the Wei River Basin (WRB), a typical arid and semi-arid region in China. Moreover, the potential influence factors on the propagation were explored from the perspectives of large-scale atmospheric circulation anomaly and underlying surface characteristics. Results indicated: (1) the propagation time from meteorological to hydrological drought has noticeably seasonal characteristics, that in spring and summer is short, whilst that in autumn and winter is long; (2) hydrological and meteorological droughts are primarily characterized by statistically positive linkages on both long and short time scales; (3) El Nifio Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Arctic Oscillation (AO) are strongly correlated with actual evaporation, thus strongly impacting the propagation time from meteorological to hydrological drought. Additionally, the propagation time has roughly positive associations with the parameter w of the Fu's equation from the Budyko framework. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
1,"Orangutans are projected to become critically endangered or extinct this century if humans continue to destroy their habitat. Threats include legal and illegal clearcutting of rain forests to establish palm oil plantations, climate change, and transnational organized crime. This study examines how self-benefit and other benefit appeals, knowledge of threats, concern about habitat loss, and liking orangutans are associated with (a) intent to protect habitat due to licit threats and crimes against wildlife, and (b) seeking information to save habitat. Upon entry to a zoo, 251 (118 men, 128 women, and 5 unknown) persons viewed posters highlighting the benefits of habitat conservation to self or others and completed a survey. Concern, threat knowledge, liking, and self-benefit and other benefit appeals accounted for 28% of the variance associated with intent to take action to protect the habitat. Integrating social influence principles into zoo displays and addressing barriers that prevent conservation behavior are discussed. The ideas in this paper are relevant to many primates and endangered species."
0,"Scirtothrips dorsalis Hood(Thysanoptera: Thripidae) is an invasive pest that is popularly known as chilli thrips. This insect pest has a wide range of hosts distributed across 72 plant families, causing damage to numerous crops of great economic importance. In the Americas, it is present in the USA, Mexico, Suriname, Venezuela, Colombia, and some Caribbean Islands. Knowing the regions which have environmentally suitable conditions for the survival of this pest is important for phytosanitary monitoring and inspection. Thus, our objective was to forecast the distribution potential of S. dorsalis with a focus on the Americas. Models were produced to design this distribution, in which the environmental variables used were made available in Wordclim version 2.1. The algorithms used for the modeling were the generalized additive model (GAM), generalized linear model (GLM), maximum entropy (MAXENT), random forest (RF), and Bioclim, in addition to the ensemble, which consisted of the grouping of the algorithms used. The metrics used to evaluate the models were area over the curve (AUC), true ability statistics (TSS), and Sorensen score. All models had satisfactory results (> 0.8) for all metrics used. In North America, the model showed favorable regions on the west coast of the USA and east coast near New York. In South America, the potential distribution of the pest is significant, encompassing regions in all countries. It is concluded that S. dorsalis has suitable areas for the occurrence in the three American subcontinents and, in particular, a large part of South America."
1,"The Program to Combat Desertification and Mitigate the Effects of Droughts in South America is being implemented at a regional scale. The general objective is to provide a sound basis for addressing dry land degradation and drought in Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador and Peru, in accordance with the UNCCD principles. Other countries, such as, Colombia, Paraguay, Uruguay and Venezuela have manifested their interest in participating in the Program and to share experiences and expertise among the countries in the Region. The Meso-America countries, are also willing to engage in the same approach of the Program, significantly expanding the basis for south-south and north-south cooperation. In Latin America, the vast majority of the 34 countries that have adhered to the UNCCD have elaborated their National Action Programmes (NAP's) in accordance with their commitments towards the Convention. Currently, a number of them are engaged in the process to have their respective NAP's fully implemented and guided by national policies targeted to control the continuous land degradation associated either with natural climatic variations or anthropogenic activities. The main objective of the Convention is to secure the long-term commitment of its Parties to combat desertification and mitigate the effects of drought through effective action at all levels, with a view to contributing to the achievement of sustainable development in affected areas. The Convention calls on the affected countries to develop National Action Programs to Combat Desertification and Drought (NAPCD), within the framework of national development plans. These include strategies and priorities, paying special attention to the related socioeconomic factors, addressing the underlying causes of dry land degradation, promoting the participation of local populations particularly women and youth, and providing an enabling environment by issuing as necessary new laws and policies. Through the Program a set of socio-economic and environmental indicators were identified in all participating countries and a common base line of indicators was derived in order to establish a common ground for the simulation of future scenarios. This is particularly of importance regarding the climate indicators such as temperature, precipation and evaporation that constitute components of the aridity index used to delimit the arid, semi-arid and the dry sub-humid areas in the region. The global warming trend is likely to change the distribution patterns of such indicators and redefine the boundaries of the aforementioned areas. These changes, as predicted by future scenarios, should be taken into account in NAP implementation and be given due consideration in the formulation of public policies towards combating desertification."
0,"Large companies were concerned about their supply chains with environmental and social sustainability and disruption from natural disasters, conflict, and trade disagreements even before the advent of COVID-19. The additional challenges presented by COVID-19 in 2020 are extreme in being distinct from supply chain risk in that not just particular companies, but also entire societies are affected. Therefore, it is appropriate to rethink supply chain management (SCM) for research and practice to cope with extreme conditions, now and in the future, whether due to pandemics, war, climate change, or biodiversity collapse. In this essay, we first present the widespread challenges, along with some of the responses. We then list research opportunities for supply chain management in extreme conditions. These opportunities pertain to retailers' survival in the face of highly successful e-commerce giants and the mixed use of robots and human workers. There are also opportunities to share supply chain capacity in distribution and coopetition regarding medically necessary items such as anti-virals or vaccines. The growing role of government in supporting business, including the creation of industry commons, also presents avenues for further research."
0,"Flooding is a recurrent event in Bangladesh, and it causes loss to life and properties. In flood risk management, the assessment of community resilience is standard practice. This study aims to assess the community flood resilience of some selected Upazilas of Jamalpur District in Bangladesh. Appropriate indicators were selected to determine flood resilience through an extensive literature review. The indicators were provided with a weight based on the expert's judgment. A structured questionnaire, consisting of appropriate questions, was prepared to collect data for all indicators. A total of 400 households were surveyed from five flood-affected Upazilas, including Dewanganj, Islampur, Madarganj, Melandaha, and Sharishabari to collect primary data. Resilience index is an analytical tool representing a numeric score ranging from 0 to 1 for each variable. The value obtained from the field survey had been divided by the weighted value of that particular variable to calculate the variable resilience index (VRI). Then, by averaging the VRI values, composite resilience index (CRI) values were calculated. The calculated CRI values are 0.30, 0.37, 0.36, 0.36, and 0.38 out of 1 in Dewanganj, Islampur, Madarganj, Melandaha, and Sharishabari Upazila, respectively, which suggest low community resilience to flooding. This study recommends enhancing the social, economic, institutional, and physical components, which can be executed through community awareness and disaster preparedness programs, to help communities strengthen resilience and cope with floods."
1,"As the world is increasingly urbanized and climate change presents new uncertainties, urban water supply management needs to be flexible and adaptable. This includes reaching beyond city limits to include water supply and watershed management, as well as working with stakeholders outside the boundaries of the city, across the urban/rural divide. Bringing together diverse stakeholders to collaborate on management strategies entails bringing together multiple knowledge systems that interact, compete, and reshape water systems. Large cities located within Peru's arid coast provide important opportunities to examine these knowledge dynamics, as urban water supplies depend on actions within the rural watersheds. These watersheds, which originate high in the Andes mountains, are populated primarily by campesino communities, who have been marginalized from state-led water governance for centuries. With Peru's adoption of the 2009 Water Resources Law, campesino communities were brought into management through multi-stakeholder river basin councils. These councils ideally provide a space for stakeholders to deliberate and reach agreements on sustainable water management. Yet, despite the critical importance of upper watershed protection for ensuring water supplies for the large coastal cities, few efforts have resulted in watershed protection. Here, I examine one successful case, where the stakeholders in Piura agreed on a program to protect critical upper basin ecosystems. This study uses a process tracing approach to analyze the knowledge dynamics that led to the agreement and initial implementation. Based on ethnographic research including 112 interviews between 2015 and 2017, I argue that the interaction between knowledge and belief systems needs to be taken into account. I find that stakeholders' seemingly incongruent worldviews and epistemologies were bridged, enabling them to reach agreement on an ecosystem-based technique for watershed protection. Further, strong leadership and active support of the knowledge and preferences of the historically-marginalized campesino communities was critical for the inclusion of their views and agreement upon watershed protection. Where urban water supplies rest on actions of non-state actors, such as is the case with watershed protection, the ability of stakeholders to voluntarily reach and implement agreements is critical, especially given increased variability and uncertainties associated with climate change."
1,"The North American (NA) terrestrial biosphere has been a long-term carbon sink but impacts of climate extremes such as drought on ecosystem carbon exchange remain largely uncertain. Here, changes in biospheric carbon fluxes with recent climate change and impacts of the major droughts of the past 30 years on continental carbon cycle across NA were studied using a comprehensive mathematical process model, ecosys. In test of these model responses at continental scale, the spatial anomalies in modeled leaf area indices, fully prognostic in the model, from long-term (1980-2010) means during major drought events in 1988 and 2002 agreed well with those in AVHRR NDVI (R-2 = 0.84 in 1988, 0.71 in 2002). Net ecosystem productivity (NEP) modeled across NA declined by 92% (0.50 Pg C yr(-1)) and 90% (0.49 Pg C yr(-1)) from the long-term mean (+0.54 Pg C yr(-1)), in 1988 and 2002 respectively. These significant drops in NEP offset 28% of the carbon gains modeled over the last three decades. Although the long-term average modeled terrestrial carbon sink was estimated to offset similar to 30% of the fossil fuel emissions of NA, only 0.03% and 3.2% were offset in 1988 and 2002 leaving almost all fossil fuel emissions to the atmosphere. These major drought events controlled much of the continental-scale interannual variability and mainly occurred in parts of the Great Plains, southwest US and northern Mexico. Although warming in northern ecosystems caused increasing carbon sinks to be modeled as a result of greater gross primary productivity with longer growing seasons, elsewhere in the continent frequent drought events of the past 30 years reduced carbon uptake and hence net carbon sinks of the NA."
0,"This Article evaluates Dirty Input Limits (DILs), quantitative limits oil the inputs that cause pollution. An environmental protection instrument that the literature has hitherto largely overlooked, DILs provide an alternative to cumbersome output-based emissions trading and performance standards. DILs have played a role in some of the world's most prominent environmental success stories. They have also begun to influence climate change policy because of the impossibility of imposing all output-based cap oil transport emissions. We evaluate DILs' administrative advantages, efficiency, dynamic properties, and capacity to better integrate environmental protection efforts. DILs, we show, not only have significant advantages that make them a good policy tool, they also help us fruitfully reconceptualize environmental law in a more holistic fashion."
0,"Community resilience to flooding depends, to a large extent, on the participation of community members to take more responsibility for enhancing their own resilience. The perception of social responsibility (SR) which is argued to be one of the antecedents influencing individual's willingness to undertake resilient behaviours can significantly contribute to community resilience through individual and collective actions. Understanding of factors influencing the perceptions of SR of individuals within community might help with developing strategies to increase the perceptions of SR. This research explores perceptions of SR in relation to flooding for householders and local businesses and establishes their relationships with experience of flooding and demographic factors of age, gender and ethnicity. The data were obtained via a questionnaire survey of three communities in Birmingham and one community in South East London, UK, three with experience of flooding and one without. A total of 414 responses were received and used in the multiple regression analysis. The analysis identified 'experience of flooding', 'age' and 'South Asian' ethnic group as significant variables, suggesting that older individuals from South Asian ethnic groups with previous experience of flooding are likely to be more socially responsible than others without these attributes."
0,"Seaweed latitudinal patterns of diversity present singularities, with implications for ecological, biogeographic and conservation studies. Despite observed global trends, distinct gradients of marine biodiversity occur along the Southwestern Atlantic (SWA) coast. However, the transitional warm-temperate marine province is a major knowledge gap, limiting conclusions about regional seaweed biodiversity. Our study investigated the composition of macroalgal assemblages in rocky intertidal shores between southern Brazil and Uruguay (from 26 degrees S to 35 degrees S), accounting for the regional oceanography and coastline features. Integrating historical and new data, we found a significant latitudinal gradient in seaweed species richness and turnover. The complex thermo-haline structure of the coastal waters, summed to large local fluvial discharges (i.e., La Plata River and Patos-Mirim Lagoon), significantly impacted the distributional pattern of macroalgal assemblages. Sea surface temperature and salinity are the main drivers of the species composition and distribution, despite the changes in coastal geomorphology and substrate availability. Whilst the northernmost section (26 degrees S-29 degrees S) was characterized by a tropical/warm-temperate phycoflora, the southernmost (32 degrees S-35 degrees S) was dominated by eurythermic and euryhaline species. Taking into account this and previous phycogeographic studies, the lowest seaweed species richness seen in SWA rocky shores occurs across 32 degrees S and 37 degrees S, while increasing towards both north (into the tropical marine province) and south (into the cold-temperate marine province). Our study fulfills knowledge gaps in Southwestern Atlantic Ocean biogeography, providing baseline information for conservation efforts and for the detection of ongoing human impacts on intertidal macroalgal assemblages."
0,"The purpose of this study is to evaluate temporal trends in changes in vegetation patterns within the Sooretama Biological Reserve and its surroundings, located in Espirito Santo State, Brazil. The evaluation will be performed using the EVI and NDVI index of the MODIS sensor, the Mann-Kendall monotonic trend, Seasonal Trend Analysis methods, and monitoring drought events through the VCI drought index for the years 2007 through 2015. The tools utilized were the EVI and NDVI indexes of the MOD13Q1 product and LST from the MOD11A2 product. These indices were used in order to represent the dynamics of the study area biomass and then to analyze the drought occurrence using the index best-suited to the area of study, identified as VCI. The temporal trends in the data set were examined, pixel by pixel, by application of the Mann-Kendall monotonic technique, treating each pixel in space as a one-dimensional temporal series of 16-day cycles. To evaluate the seasonal trend, the analysis used the STA technique (Seasonal Trend Analysis) implemented in the ETM module. The characterization and spatial distribution of drought events were performed through the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI). The use of (a) images and seasonal curves produced by the monotonic trend of Mann-Kendall and (b) analysis of seasonal trends generated the response of the vegetation to climate variations. The VCI indicated a potential for drought occurrence analysis in regions and areas with different vegetation densities. So, the VCI can be used as a powerful tool to compose a comprehensive and early system alert of drought that can accompany the changes in spatial coverage of vegetation and severity of change. Lastly, the analysis of the data from the MODIS NDVI, EVI, and TST images indicated that the data is suitable to a space-time analysis of drought occurrences and vegetation trends."
1,"Salt marshes and their inhabitants are being displaced by climate change and human development along the coastline. One inhabitant, the ribbed mussel (Geukensia demissa), forms a mutualistic relationship with smooth cordgrass, Sporobolus alterniflorus, along the US Atlantic Coast. Ribbed mussels stabilize the marsh, remove particulate matter from the water column, and promote denitrification, thereby improving local water quality. To quantify the potential effects of SLR on ribbed mussel abundance and resulting impacts on water quality functions, we compared the current and projected future (2050) spatial distributions of ribbed mussels in Chesapeake Bay assuming an intermediate SLR for the region. We found that ribbed mussel abundance was reduced by more than half due to a combination of drowning marshes, coastal squeeze, and a shift from higher to lower quality habitat. Mussel losses were greatest along the mainstem of the Chesapeake Bay, with modest gains in the headwaters. Our results highlight the importance of permeable land cover (including living shorelines) in the future tidal extent to promote marsh transgression for future mussel populations. The projected mussel abundance reductions will result in a > 50% reduction in mussel-mediated filtration and nitrogen processing, ultimately reducing the resilience of marshes in the system."
0,"Enhancing food security is the main goal of subsistence farmers, who are vulnerable to food insecurity in sub-Saharan Africa. Participatory research across food value chains (FVC) can help stabilize and enhance food security by developing upgrading strategies (UPS). However, prior to successful widespread adoption and geographical upscaling, such practices need in-depth understanding of their suitability in target areas and their particular local requirements. Ex-ante assessments of selected UPS were carried out by German and Tanzanian agricultural scientists using the ScalA-FS tool. The participating experts included those responsible for implementation. The tool aims to systematically evaluate, at the community level, UPS that have been successfully implemented elsewhere, evaluate their potential for dissemination, and identify entry points for adjustments during implementation. Assessment indicators were developed through a participatory process. UPS relate to a) natural resource management and crop production; b) food processing and bioenergy; c) income generation and market participation; and d) food consumption. Here we present the ScalA-FS assessment results on UPS suitability as well as on its implementation requirements. We focused on the local context needed to enable a productive collaboration between smallholder farmers and implementing research and/or development organizations. Implementation requirements for the selected UPS were assessed as generally low to medium, and projected suitability in most cases was high. Local knowledge and education (human capital) along with visible success after a short time were important criteria of success of UPS. Here, careful consideration of the challenges before and after implementation of UPS is suggested. ScalA-FS should be applied early in the implementation process of UPS in order to support adaptations and successful upscaling at other locations."
1,"While a substantial reduction of GHG (greenhouse gases) is urged, large-scale mitigation implies a detailed and holistic knowledge on the role of specific cropping systems, including the effect of management choices and local factors on the final balance between emissions and removals, this last typical of cropping systems. Here, a conventionally managed irrigated kiwifruit orchard has been studied to assess its greenhouse gases emissions and removals to determine its potential action as a C sink or, alternately, as a C source. The paper integrates two independent approaches. Biological CO2 fluxes have been monitored during 2012 using the micrometeorological Eddy covariance technique, while life cycle assessment quantified emissions derived from the energy and material used. In a climatic-standard year, total GHG emitted as consequence of the management were 4.25 t CO2-eq(-1) ha(-1) yr(-1) while the net uptake measured during the active vegetation phase was as high as 4.9 t CO2 ha(-1) yr(-1). This led to a positive contribution of the crop to CO2 absorption, with a 1.15 efficiency ratio (sink-source factor defined as t CO2 stored/t CO2 emitted). The mitigating activity, however, completely reversed under extremely unfavorable climatic conditions, such as those recorded in 2003, when the efficiency ratio became 0.91, demonstrating that the occurrence of hotter and drier conditions are able to compromise the capability of Actinidia to offset the GHG emissions, also under appropriate irrigation."
1,"Context. Marine turtle eggs incubate in dynamic beaches, where they are vulnerable to both saltwater and freshwater flooding. Understanding the capacity for marine turtle eggs to tolerate flooding will aid management efforts to predict and mitigate the impacts of climate change, including sea-level rise and increases in coastal flooding. Aims. Evaluate the interactive effects of flooding duration and incubation stage on the hatching success of loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta) eggs. Methods. Groups of 20 eggs from multiple clutches were incubated in plastic containers in a beach hatchery. Eggs at six stages of incubation (0, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 7 weeks post-oviposition) were excavated from the hatchery and exposed to saltwater or freshwater flooding for seven durations of time (0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 24 or 48 h). Containers of eggs were either submerged in a bucket of water or left outside of the bucket (control; no flooding) for their designated duration, allowed to drain, then reburied in the hatchery. Following hatchling emergence, the hatching success of each group of eggs was evaluated. Key results. Freshly laid eggs and eggs on the verge of hatching exposed to any flooding and all eggs exposed to extended periods of flooding (24 and 48 h) suffered complete mortality. Eggs at 20-80% development exposed to short periods of flooding (1-6 h) maintained high hatching success that was statistically equivalent to control eggs, while eggs at <20% and >80% development exhibited significant decreases in hatching success. Conclusions. Marine turtle eggs in the middle of incubation can tolerate saltwater and freshwater flooding for up to 6 h. Outside of this period or when flooding is longer, disruption of gas concentrations and osmotic gradients in the egg chamber can lead to embryonic mortality. These findings have reinforced concerns regarding the capacity for marine turtle populations to continue to function as rising sea levels and increases in coastal flooding alter the hydrology of nesting beaches. Implications. As current and predicted climate change threatens the suitability of the incubation environment used by marine turtles, corrective actions to maximise hatching success need to be taken before the eggs are flooded."
1,"Fire is recognized to be an important disturbance in many ecosystems worldwide, although desert ecosystems are not generally thought of as being prone to fire, primarily because of the lack of a continuous fuel bed. However, the likelihood of catastrophic fires in some desert systems is increasing due to the spread of exotic species, which can grow in the open. A second factor increasing fire risk may be extreme rainfall events caused by climate warming that can lead to an increase in fuel loads. Our work explores the impact of increased rainfall on fire risk in creosote shrublands that have been invaded by exotic grasses. We take experimental results from creosote (Larrea tridentata) shrublands in the Mojave and Sonoran Deserts of the Southwestern United States and develop spatially explicit simulation models to explore the impact of shifting rainfall regimes on biomass production and fire spread. In doing this, we explore two scales that are important in the spread of fire: (1) the macro-scale which considers the likelihood that fire arriving at one edge of a modeled landscape will successfully reach the opposite edge, leading to spread at a broader scale; and (2) the micro-scale, which considers fire spread within the landscape. We use a very simple model to first explore how changes in the distribution of fuel in the landscape impact the ability of fire to spread across and within the landscape. We then add more realism by including a direct consideration of creosote shrub distributions and biomass levels produced in different vegetation zones associated with distance from creosote. Our models show that the spread of fire at both macro-and micro-scales can be predicted from a knowledge of the statistical distribution of biomass in the field. The only additional information that is needed to predict the extent of fire spread is the amount of biomass at a local site (g m(-2)) required to ignite standing biomass in adjacent sites. This will depend upon species composition as well as amount of biomass, the hydration status of the vegetation and climatic conditions, such as windspeed and relative humidity."
0,"Rapid population growth, industrialization, and agricultural activities have impacted water resources in the arid and semi-arid areas of Somalia. The Lower Juba region in Somalia has been the most affected region. Therefore, an analysis of the hydrological patterns is essential. This paper assesses streamflow and evapotranspiration in the Wabiga Juba basin in Somalia using a hydrological simulation model, namely, the water evaluation and planning (WEAP) system via the soil moisture method. The datasets included 53 (average precipitation) and 13 (streamflow) year periods from two meteorological stations. The estimated values for potential evapotranspiration (11,921.98 to 20,775.39 MCM) were higher than the actual evapotranspiration (4904.10 to 8242.72 MCM) by 50 to 79.5%, respectively. The annual streamflow in Juba Dolow and runoff proportion of the Wabiga Juba River was estimated to be 10% of the annual precipitation. Most of the surface runoff occurred in April (47%), May (31%), October (5%), and November (14%). The streamflow variation responded to the pattern of precipitation. The model performance achieved a Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency (NSE) coefficient of 0.71, coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.91, and percent bias (PBIAS) of 14%. The WEAP model of the Wabiga Juba basin is a baseline study for water resource management in Somalia to mitigate water shortage impacts due to limited water resources."
1,"Smallholder farmers in semi-arid areas depend on both cropping and livestock as the main sources of livelihoods. Rangeland productivity varies on both spatial and temporal scales and provides the major source of feed for livestock. Rangeland productivity is expected to decline with climate change thereby reducing livestock feed availability and consequently livelihoods that depend on livestock. This study was carried out to assess the impacts of climate change on rangeland productivity and consequently livestock population dynamics using a 30-year simulation modeling approach. The climate scenarios used in the simulations are built from the localized predictions by General Circulation Models (GCMs). The primary climate variables under consideration are rainfall (+/-7% change), carbon dioxide (CO2 up to 650 ppm) and temperature (+4 degrees C change). This was done by applying the SAVANNA ecosystem model which simulates rangeland processes and demographic responses of herbivores on a temporal and spatial scale using a weekly internal time step and monthly spatial and temporal outputs. The results show that rainfall levels of less than 600 mm/year have the largest negative effect on herbaceous biomass production. The amount of biomass from the woody layer does not change much during the year. The carbon dioxide (CO2) effects are more influential on the tree and shrub layers (C-3 plants) than the herbaceous layer (C-4 grasses). The CO2 effect was more dominant than the effects of rainfall and temperature. In the baseline simulations, the shrub plant layer increased significantly over 30 years while there is a three-fold increase in the woody plant layer (trees and shrubs) where biomass increased from a 1980 production to that of 2010. The biomass of the herbaceous layer was stable over the historical period (1980 to 2010) with values fluctuating between 200 and 400 g/m(2). Grass green biomass has a variable distribution where most production occurred in the fields and cleared areas while lower levels of production were found in the forested areas. The spatial distribution of shrub green biomass was less directly linked to yearly rainfall. Shrub biomass was mostly found in forested areas, and it showed a steady increase in production. Cattle, donkey, and goat populations rose slowly from 1980 but the rise was disrupted by a dry period during the late 1980s to the early 1990s causing a decline in all populations primarily due to grass unavailability. The populations of cattle goats and donkeys started to rise again from 1995 onwards due to improvements in rainfall. Cattle and donkey populations were rising faster than that of goats while sheep population was not changing much for most of the simulation period, otherwise they declined significantly during the drought of 2002. Similar changes in simulated grass biomass (g/m(2)) were observed in almost all climate scenarios, except for the peak and low years. The livestock population simulation showed few variations in livestock population under all scenarios. The main conclusion from the study is that CO2 effects on rangeland productivity are much more dominant than the localized effects of rainfall and temperature. This has implications of favoring the growth of the tree and shrub layers over herbaceous layer, which meant that in the long run, the species that are able to use tree and shrub layers may be kept as a livelihood source as they will have a feed source."

1,"Extreme weather events have become more frequent and intense under global warming in recent years, which has attracted much attention of scholars at home and abroad. In this paper, we used data sets of daily precipitation recorded at 499 meteorological stations to analyze the temporal and spatial variations of precipitation extremes in China over the past 50 years (1960-2009). Through the comparison of detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) and the percentile method, DFA was selected to define the thresholds of precipitation extremes in China. Temporal variations of extreme precipitation amount, frequency, and intensity were analyzed in four major regions: Northwest China, the Qinghai-Tibet region, North China, and South China. Spatial distributions were obtained by the Kriging interpolation method, and then, we examined the varying tendencies of extreme precipitation amount, frequency, and intensity by the Mann-Kendall test. The results show that increasing trends are dominant for all indices over China; extreme precipitation amount and frequency appear to have risen since 1970-1979, but there are some regional differences. The Qinghai-Tibet region and South China have an ascending trend, and Northwest China maintains balance while North China has a descending trend. The amount and intensity of precipitation extremes are decreasing from southeastern coastal areas to northwestern inlands, and the frequency of precipitation extremes is randomly distributed. However, they are all high in the Sichuan Basin, the middle and lower Yangtze River, and the southern part of South China. Trends of most stations are statistically insignificant, but the percentage of stations with a significant increased trend in the Qinghai-Tibet region is larger than that of other regions."
0,"Implementing the domestic biogas technology program is vital for developing countries like Ethiopia to provide decentralized modern renewable energy. This study examines the role of biogas technology adoption impacts household fuelwood consumption reduction and forest conservation in Motta district Northwest Ethiopia. A total of 198 households (65 adapters and 133 non-adopters) were involved in the household survey. The binary logistic regression model was used to determine factors affecting the household decision on biogas adoption. The Kitchen performance test method was employed to quantify the mean daily fuelwood consumption on 25 households from each adoption category. The result revealed that the annual fuel-wood and charcoal saving potential fully functional biogas plant was 1306.70kg/hh/yr., 400.05kg/hh/yr. of dried biomass wood, respectively. Accordingly, if all 100 biogas plants in the study area can be fully functional, the total fuelwood and charcoal saving potential were estimated at 170.72ton/yr. of dried biomass in the study area is equivalent to reducing the depletion of 0.51hectare/yr-forest land in the district. Sex, Farmland size, Total annual income, Number of livestock, and Awareness were the most important factors that affect a household's decision to adopt biogas technology. For better scaling-up and sustainable domestication of biogas technology for reducing deforestation and wood extraction, experts in the biogas energy sector should work in association with experts of agriculture, forest sector, the environment, and climate change."
1,"Changes in climatic patterns, manifested as intensified cyclones and torrential rainfalls in a warming world will inevitably impact the frequency of landslides. One such climatic extreme, Cyclone Idai (March 2019), caused significant havoc across southeastern Africa, including Mozambique, Malawi, and eastern Zimbabwe, by triggering thousands of landslides and widespread concurrent flooding, both of which resulted in substantial loss of life. The study was conducted in the Chimanimani District of eastern Zimbabwe to understand the impact of Cyclone Idai on landslide initiation, quantify the volume of mobilized hillslope material during the event, and compare the event-triggered material release against the annual erosional yield across the study area using machine learning and remote sensing techniques. We evaluated satellite imagery of various resolutions, namely, PlanetScope (3m/px),RapidEye (5m/px), and Sentinel-2 (tom/px) and three machine learning algorithms: artificial neural network (ANN), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) to identify landslides and compared the efficacy of the models. A total of nine predictor variables derived from the satellite imagery and a 3o-m ASTER Global Digital Elevation Model were employed to identify landslides and differentiate them from concurrent hydrological flooding. The models classified the study area into three classes: (i) landslides, (ii) flooding, and (iii) unaffected area. The RF model using PlanetScope satellite data attained the highest prediction accuracy of 97.88%, whereas the accuracy of other machine learning model-satellite data combinations ranged between 94.58 and 97.27%. Subsequently, landslide size thresholds were applied on the initially mapped landslides to eliminate noise and uncertainty from the data before estimating the final Cyclone Idai event-triggered landslide volume. A probability density function, which corresponds to a logarithmic plot of non-cumulative landslide frequency against the mapped landslide area, was employed to calculate landslide size thresholds using divergence and rollover point cutoff values. Finally, a landslide area-to-volume power-law scaling relationship was exploited to derive landslide volumes in the study area that ranged between 6.8 x 10(6) to 14.7 x 10(6) m(3) and 9.0 x 10(6) to 19.6 x 10(6) m(3) for divergence and rollover point thresholds, respectively, across the different combinations of machine learning models and satellite sensors. The estimated landslide volume indicates hillslope material liberated by Cyclone Idai was 269 to 345 times greater than the estimated annual average background denudation of the study area computed from a topography-based local erosion model."
1,"While existing studies on sewer networks have explored topics such as surface water inflow, limited research has delved into groundwater infiltration (GWI). This study aims to fill this void by providing a comprehensive overview of quantitative analyses of GWI in sewer networks plus current status, limitations and future perspectives, considering the most relevant peer-reviewed research, including 83 studies. We propose dividing the existing research into two main groups: (1) phreatic zone, and (2) vadose zone. Most research has focused on the latter, mainly considering Rainfall-Derived Inflow and Infiltration (RDII), including surface water inflow and GWI. The ratio of each is not frequently separated; otherwise, there may be some assumptions, e.g. in dry weather and assuming zero surface water inflow. We also divided the employed approaches in different categories from physically-based numerical models, to simpler ones, e.g. water budget analysis. In fact, a combination of approaches may be applied to find the intricate characteristics of 'urban groundwater' or 'urban karst.' The findings revealed a heightened vulnerability of sewer networks to GWI, due to climate change (CC) and its associated repercussions, e.g. sea level rise (SLR), making the coastal cities the most vulnerable regions. In future research, the criticality of pre-emptive measures and monitoring of networks, especially near the coastline, is emphasised to ensure the resilience and adaptability of sewer networks in the context of GWI amid the potential impacts of CC. However, current monitoring practices lack widespread evidence for spatiotemporal analysis of GWI quantity."
0,"The economic effects of climate change on agriculture have been widely assessed in the last two decades. Many of these assessments are based on the integration of biophysical and agro-economic models, allowing to understand the physical and socio-economic responses of the agricultural sector to future climate change scenarios. The evolution of the bio-economic approach has gone through different stages. This review analyses its evolution: firstly, framing the bio-economic approach into the context of the assessments of climate change impacts, and secondly, by reviewing empirical studies at the global and European level. Based on this review, common findings emerge in both global and regional assessments. Among them, the authors show that overall results tend to hide significant disparities on smaller spatial scales. Furthermore, due to the effects of crop prices over yield changes, several authors highlight the need to consider endogenous price models to assess production impacts of climate change. Further, major developments are discussed: the progress made since the last two decades and the recent methods used to provide insights into modeling uncertainties. However, there are still challenges to be met. On this matter, the authors take these unresolved challenges as guidelines for future research."
0,"Bioeconomy is not an autonomous sector of the economy, but rather a complex mechanism involving agriculture, industry, biotechnology, service sectors and consumers. To measure the size of the bioeconomy in European Union (EU) countries, it is necessary to create appropriate indicators that allow it to be monitored with reference to its current state, growth rate and sector description. In many countries, including Poland, there is no complete information or data collection system to monitor bioeconomy development directly, e.g. in the Polish Central Statistical Office. In response to these needs, several groups of indicators related to the circular economy, sustainable development and Europe 2020 were created by the European Commission (EC) in the Eurostat database. These indicators can help monitoring of bioeconomy development in EU countries. The present study discusses factors for bioeconomy development through an analysis of their social, economic and environmental aspects, as well as showing the value of the selected indicators in the EU and Poland. In addition, a separate section is dedicated to public perception of bioeconomy and to legislation regarding genetically modified organisms (GMOs). To date, many research studies have been reported on the public acceptance of bioeconomy issues in the EU, including renewable resources, biofuels, GMOs, bio-based products, food security and climate change. The awareness and perception of society on the bioeconomy, bio-based products and processes, and the sustainable use of resources can contribute to environmental sustainability, but intensified efforts are required to increase public acceptance."
1,"Global sea level rise is a known consequence of climate change. As predictions of sea level rise have grown in magnitude and certainty, coastal real estate assets face an increasing climate risk. I use a complete data set of repeated home sales from Long Island in New York State to estimate the appreciation discount caused by the threat of sea level rise. The repeat sale methodology allows for time-invariant, unobserved property characteristics to be controlled for. Between 2000 and 2017, I find that residential properties that were exposed to future sea level rise experienced an annual price appreciation rate of roughly 1% point below unexposed properties. I provide numerous robustness checks to confirm this result. I also find evidence of demand spillovers by estimating an appreciation premium for properties that are near the coast but are relatively safe from sea level rise."
1,"Mining activities depend significantly on water resources availability as it consists a major tool of the extraction, processing and the post closure mining operations. Especially, groundwater is the major water source in most mining areas. However, overexploitation, competition from the communities and climate change effects have caused significant stress on the groundwater resources in many areas of the Mediterranean basin. The sustainability of mining operations is threatened as well as the uninterrupted supply of raw materials to the industry. In this work spatial estimation and analysis of groundwater stress at hydrological basin-scale in the European part of the Mediterranean region is applied using local and global datasets. Aquifer productivity index and groundwater use information at monitoring sites are extracted from the River Basin Management Plans of the European Environment Agency, while groundwater recharge is considered from the World-wide Hydrogeological Mapping and Assessment Program (WHYMAP) after validation. The processing of these data using the Self Organized Maps technique and their integration within a novel function, provide the groundwater stress index. The output of this work can be used for governance and management decisions that will improve groundwater resources availability in vulnerable areas ensuring the sustainable use from the communities and the industry.

1,"Within freshwater networks, lakes and reservoirs are reactors that modify nutrient dynamics. Their functioning is based on an interplay of hydrological and biogeochemical processes, rendering them vulnerable to climate change. Future changes in catchment characteristics are likely to alter the timing and magnitude of nutrient concentrations in discharge. This study investigated the impact of changing variability of nutrient concentrations on lake and reservoir dynamics. We examined intraannual nutrient retention and analyzed the role of reservoirs in reconfiguring the variability of nutrients. Utilizing the 1D lake model GOTM-WET, we simulated nutrient processing in a mesotrophic reservoir. Further, we performed scenario simulations by modifying the variability of inflow nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations. Our findings indicate that the reservoir removed similar to 4% and similar to 12% of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP), respectively. Particulate fractions were retained efficiently, but there was a net export of dissolved organic fractions. Regarding mixing and stratification periods, however, we observed net nitrogen export during stratification in certain years. During stratification, outflow concentration variability remained relatively unchanged for TN and TP compared to inflow concentrations. Conversely, phosphate and nitrate concentration variability increased in the outflow because of in-lake assimilation and the influence of hydrological events. With increasing inflow concentration variability during stratification, there was decreased removal of TN and TP by the reservoir, but increased variability of concentration. By evaluating the lake's capacity to attenuate variability of nutrient inflows under altered conditions, there are opportunities to improve monitoring of nutrient export and evaluate the potential impact of nutrient peaks on downstream drinking water resources and ecosystems."
0,"Biotic communities and ecosystem dynamics in terrestrial Antarctica are limited by an array of extreme conditions including low temperatures, moisture and organic matter availability, high salinity, and a paucity of biodiversity to facilitate key ecological processes. Recent studies have discovered that the prokaryotic communities in these extreme systems are highly diverse with patchy distributions. Investigating the physical and biological controls over the distribution and activity of microbial biodiversity in Victoria Land is essential to understanding ecological functioning in this region. Currently, little information on the distribution, structure and activity of soil communities anywhere in Victoria Land are available, and their sensitivity to potential climate change remains largely unknown. We investigated soil microbial communities from low- and high-productivity habitats in an isolated Antarctic location to determine how the soil environment impacts microbial community composition and structure. The microbial communities in Luther Vale, Northern Victoria Land were analysed using bacterial 16S rRNA gene clone libraries and were related to soil geochemical parameters and classical morphological analysis of soil metazoan invertebrate communities. A total of 323 16S rRNA gene sequences analysed from four soils spanning a productivity gradient indicated a high diversity (Shannon-Weaver values > 3) of phylotypes within the clone libraries and distinct differences in community structure between the two soil productivity habitats linked to water and nutrient availability. In particular, members of the Deinococcus/Thermus lineage were found exclusively in the drier, low-productivity soils, while Gammaproteobacteria of the genus Xanthomonas were found exclusively in high-productivity soils. However, rarefaction curves indicated that these microbial habitats remain under-sampled. Our results add to the recent literature suggesting that there is a higher biodiversity within Antarctic soils than previously expected."
0,"Considering the challenge that the economic, social and ecological systems face -in order to know and mitigate the global climate change-, evidences of the functional structure of mangroves ecological system are presented revisiting the hypothesis presented by Yanez-Arancibia et al. (1998), and revised latter by Yanez-Arancibia et al. (2010): the mangroves as a critical forest habitat of the coastal zone present accommodation responses to the environmental variability that induces global change playing an structural and functional role in the stability of the coastline, the persistence of habitats and biodiversity, the metabolism of the ecosystem, reducing risks and uncertainty for the sustainable development of the use of its resources. Recent evidences indicates that mangroves in the Gulf of Mexico follows this hypothesis and -as answer to climate change and its effects in the coastal zone- shows a consistent pattern of geographical distribution colonizing all over the northern coast of the Gulf, including the Atlantic coast of Florida Peninsula because of the opportunity of global tropicalization of the Gulf of Mexico. Moreover, at present the four mangrove species in the Gulf of Mexico are distributed in the Texas state U.S. We conclude that mangrove ecosystem is a sentinel-ecosystem in front of climate change impact in the Gulf of Mexico."
0,"Distribution models should take into account the different limiting factors that simultaneously influence species ranges. Species distribution models built with different explanatory variables can be combined into more comprehensive ones, but the resulting models should maximize complementarity and avoid redundancy. Our aim was to compare the different methods available for combining species distribution models. We modelled 19 threatened vertebrate species in mainland Spain, producing models according to three individual explanatory factors: spatial constraints, topography and climate, and human influence. We used five approaches for model combination: Bayesian inference, Akaike weight averaging, stepwise variable selection, updating, and fuzzy logic. We compared the performance of these approaches by assessing different aspects of their classification and discrimination capacity. We demonstrated that different approaches to model combination give rise to disparities in the model outputs. Bayesian integration was systematically affected by an error in the equations that are habitually used in distribution modelling. Akaike weights produced models that were driven by the best single factor and therefore failed at combining the models effectively. The updating and the stepwise approaches shared recalibration as the basic concept for model combination, were very similar in their performance, and showed the highest sensitivity and discrimination capacity. The fuzzy-logic approach yielded models with the highest classification capacity according to Cohen's kappa. In conclusion: 1) Bayesian integration, employing the currently used equation, and the Akaike weight procedure should be avoided; 2) the updating and stepwise approaches can be considered minor variants of the same recalibrating approach; and 3) there is a trade-off between this recalibrating approach, which has the highest sensitivity, and fuzzy logic, which has the highest overall classification capacity. Recalibration is better if unfavourable conditions in one environmental factor may be counterbalanced with favourable conditions in a different factor, otherwise fuzzy logic is better."
0,"Protected areas (PAs) are the critical societal tool to preserve biodiversity and ecosystem services (ESs), but human disturbances frequently threaten them. Here, we used multiple data sources to map the human footprint as a proxy for identifying the intensity of human activities on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and therein nature reserves (NRs, the primary category of PAs in China). We found that the human footprint on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau has increased by 22% since 2000, and on average, human pressure inside NRs was 60% lower than outside. However, human pressure was identified in the majority of the NRs, with only 30% of protected land free from any measurable pressure. From a total of 53 NRs, 28 showed over 10% increase in human footprint, and 6 NRs had over 70% of their extent under intense human pressure (human footprint score >= 4). Furthermore, a higher proportion of ESs in NRs is subjected to high levels of human pressure and are therefore at risk, particularly soil and water retention. The applied regression model revealed that large NRs are more resilient to human pressure than NRs with the longer establishment. The continuous human footprint increase may hinder the current and future ESs supply. Our analysis shows evidence-based results to promote the mitigation of human pressures in PAs."
0,"Background: Cacti establish mostly occurs under the canopy of nurse plants which provide a less stressful micro-environment, although mechanisms underlying this process are unknown. The impact of the combination of light and watering treatments on Opuntia streptacantha (Cactaceae) seedlings was examined. Methods/Principal Findings: Ecophysiological [titratable acidity, osmotic potential ('solute potential', psi(s)), relative growth rate (RGR) and their components (NAR, SLA, and LWR)], anatomical (chloroplast density, chloroplast frequency, and cell area), and environmental [photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) and air temperature] sets of variables were analyzed, assessing relationships between them and measuring the intensity of the relationships. Three harvests were carried out at days 15, 30, and 45. psi(s) and acidity content were the most important responses for seedling establishment. The main anatomical and environmental variables were chloroplast density and water availability, respectively. Opuntia streptacantha seedlings establish better in the shade-watering treatment, due to higher psi(s) and acidity, unaffected chloroplasts, and lower PPFD. In addition, the chloroplasts of cells under high-light and non-watering treatment were clumped closer to the center of the cytosol than those under shade-drought, to avoid photoinhibition and/or to better distribute or utilize the penetrating light in the green plant tissue. Conclusions: Opuntia seedlings grow better under the shade, although they can tolerate drought in open spaces by increasing and moving chloroplasts and avoiding drastic decreases in their psi(s). This tolerance could have important implications for predicting the impact of climate change on natural desert regeneration, as well as for planning reforestation-afforestation practices, and rural land uses."
1,"Forest ecosystems face increasing drought exposure due to climate change, necessitating accurate measurements of vegetation water content to assess drought stress and tree mortality risks. Although Frequency Domain Reflectometry offers a viable method for monitoring stem water content by measuring dielectric permittivity, challenges arise from uncertainties in sensor calibration linked to wood properties and species variability, impeding its wider usage. We sampled tropical forest trees and palms in eastern Amaz & ocirc;nia to evaluate how sensor output differences are controlled by wood density, temperature and taxonomic identity. Three individuals per species were felled and cut into segments within a diverse dataset comprising five dicotyledonous tree and three monocotyledonous palm species on a wide range of wood densities. Water content was estimated gravimetrically for each segment using a temporally explicit wet-up/dry-down approach and the relationship with the dielectric permittivity was examined. Woody tissue density had no significant impact on the calibration, but species identity and temperature significantly affected sensor readings. The temperature artefact was quantitatively important at large temperature differences, which may have led to significant bias of daily and seasonal water content dynamics in previous studies. We established the first tropical tree and palm calibration equation which performed well for estimating water content. Notably, we demonstrated that the sensitivity remained consistent across species, enabling the creation of a simplified one-slope calibration for accurate, species-independent measurements of relative water content. Our one-slope calibration serves as a general, species-independent standard calibration for assessing relative water content in woody tissue, offering a valuable tool for quantifying drought responses and stress in trees and forest ecosystems."
1,"Paying attention to land degradation in drylands is of international significance because it plays a crucial role in global food production. This study developed the optimal land degradation index (OLDI) model for arid and semiarid areas. The model utilized a system that assessed soil condition, climate response, human disturbance, and vegetation growth. It was based on a constrained optimization algorithm. Based on the analysis of the distribution pattern of the OLDI in the Hexi Corridor, this study aims to explore the spatial and temporal characteristics of land degradation and the variations in land sensitivity to degradation across different seasons through trend analysis. Furthermore, the main variables that control the environment and are responsible for land degradation or improvement were revealed through the analysis of driving factors. It was found that the oasis areas in the southern part of the Hexi Corridor experienced land improvement due to the combined influence of human activities and climate change, while the northern region underwent continuous land degradation. However, overall, the majority of the study area's land remained stable. The reduction in precipitation and the increase in wind speed were identified as the primary driving forces behind land degradation. Different vegetation types exhibited distinct responses to environmental control factors, and these responses varied significantly with the changing seasons. Based on the regional variations in land degradation and the observed sensitivity characteristics during different seasons, this study proposes a land management strategy that combines natural recovery with artificial restoration to achieve effective prevention, control, and management of land degradation. This study provided an effective tool for monitoring land degradation in arid and semiarid areas, which is of significant importance for land resource management and the sustainable development of the green economy, not only in the northwest region of China but also in arid and semiarid areas worldwide."
1,"The Vertically Generalized Production Model (VGPM) is a standard algorithm of satellite -derived primary production which is widely used to study the effect of climate change on marine ecosystem, but whether it can be accurately applied to regional seas remain questionable. Taiwan is an island and its central is located near the Tropic of Cancer (23.5 N) in the northwest Pacific. The sea surrounding Taiwan is rich in biological resources and biodiversity due to the rugged seabed topography and the fluctuation of three major water masses (Kuroshio, South China Sea and China Coastal Water). In order to study the effect of climate change on marine ecosystem in the sea surrounding Taiwan and assess the applicability of VGPM, seasonal field investigations of primary production were conducted in 2018. Seasonal variation of primary production observed in winter, spring, summer and autumn is between 42-911, 113-456, 124-832, 249-1898 mgC m-2,-1a, respectively. The corresponding sea surface temperature variations were 15.9-25.7, 23.5-28.4, 28.5-30.4 and 21.7-26.5 C, respectively. Comparing the measured data with the VGPM model results (measured values of sea surface chlorophyll concentration, euphotic zoon depth, day length and light intensity were used in the model), the average relative error of measured and model results arc 466 321. 318 252, 4 48 and 98 61 % in winter, spring, summer and autumn, respectively. The high relative error mainly comes from the inaccuracy of the temperature -dependent optimal carbon fixation rate (PoBpt), which is the most important factor affecting the accuracy of the model. Our results show that primary production derived from the VGPM model cannot be used for long-term research on climate change in the seas surrounding Taiwan."
0,"Drought as a natural phenomenon, due to variability of meteorological conditions, strikes worldwide but the severity of its impact depends on the vulnerabilities of water supply systems and economical and sectors as well as on the effectiveness of the adopted mitigation measures. The aim of this paper is to study achieving efficiency and equity in sugar factories and sugar-cropping patterns in Upper and Middle Egypt by focusing on the Strategic Water Shortage Preparedness Plan, introduction methodologies, and specific action to fight drought within the general water-planning framework. The Linear Programming Model was applied to calculate the sugar crops, sugar cane and sugar beet acreage, production, and income of both Upper and Middle Egypt. As a result of an optimal cropping pattern, the cultivation season would lose acreage by 7.260%, farm income increase by 1.774%, water uses decrease by 18.511%, and CO2 emission and energy reduced by 14.96%. Overall, as a result of an optimal sugar-cropping pattern, Egyptian sugar exports would decrease by $130.086 million US. [EconLit classification: Q130 and Q000]."
0,"The consumption of western diets that are often rich in animal-source foods and low in wholesome, plant-based foods, has grave implications for public health. This is expressed in a growing prevalence of obesity as well as high rates of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases and some cancers. At the same time, current global dietary patterns are major contributors to global environmental challenges, i.e. the climate and the biodiversity crisis, and are thereby a major threat to planetary health. Shifting to more plant-based diets, e.g. in line with the Planetary Health Diet, provides a major opportunity to improve individual and planetary health. Plant-based dietary patterns with an increase in the consumption of anti-inflammatory and a decrease in pro-inflammatory substances can also lead to improvements in pain symptoms, especially in inflammatory or degenerative joint diseases. In addition, dietary shifts are a prerequisite to achieve global environmental targets and thereby ensure a livable and healthy future for everyone. Medical professionals therefore have a special responsibility to actively promote this transformation."
1,"Chelonoidis land tortoises are iconic species endemic to the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador. Their populations have been dramatically reduced by human activities in the last three centuries, including indirect effects such as the introduction of invasive species. We investigated the mortality of eggs and hatchlings in 48 nests of Chelonoidis porteri on Santa Cruz Island with regard to various mortality causes such as the occurrence of fire ants and the date of laying. The average mortality rate was 0.56. Tropical Fire Ants (Solenopsis geminata) were present within 1 m of 75% of the C porteri nests, and we encountered fire ants in 12.5% of excavated nests. We found no relationship between Tropical Fire Ant abundance and C porteri egg and hatchling survivorship. We observed no signs of mold inside the nests. We determined that early deposition dates were associated with lower clutch survival and identified egg development as the critical life stage. Finally, we discuss the potential impacts of fire ants and climate change on tortoise survival and reproduction and stress the importance of taking these factors into account for the conservation of the endemic land tortoises of the Galapagos."
1,"The native Yellowstone cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii bouvieri; YCT) of Yellowstone Lake, Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, USA, presents a metapopulation that inhabits an ecologically simple, uniquely pristine, and highly protected environment. Recent investigation of a key YCT spawning stock's 1977-1992 dynamics, before predation from an illegally introduced and growing lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) population measurably affecting YCT population dynamics, showed the new climate regime that began in the 1970s largely explained declining YCT spawning runs, although the concurrent and growing predation effect soon became dominant. The present study's time series analyses of annual (1969-2010) gillnet catches from 11 lake locations showed the metapopulation's age-5 YCT abundance rapidly declined to low levels 7 years after the spawning stock's (median YCT age, 5 years) similar decline. Since the 1980s, the Yellowstone region has experienced increasing drought that has reduced wetlands and associated tributaries used by the lake's spawning YCT. While small tributaries were first to become unsuitable for YCT spawning and early rearing, the spawning stock's tributary was of moderate size and its population persisted later. Two conditions are necessary for YCT metapopulation recovery to historically high levels: (1) climatic conditions must return to those prevalent around 1980 and (2) the lake trout population must be reduced to its mid-1990s levels. The most recent time of YCT metapopulation abundance and broadest spatial extent occurred under those simultaneous conditions. Similarities between the metapopulation's structure and dynamics and those reported for metapopulations of anadromous salmonids are described, including adverse effects of ongoing climate change."
1,"There is growing evidence of the Lilliput effect in the end-Permian mass extinction and its aftermath. However, very little has been published on assessing the Lilliput effect on protozoans in the Early Triassic based on quantitative analysis of a great quantity of samples from outcrop sections. This study investigates foraminiferal test size variations through the Changhsingian to the Olenekian based on fossil records from three outcrop sections in South China. The sharp reduction in foraminifer sizes coincides with the first or main episode of the end-Permian mass extinction. Foraminifers remained small in sizes in the early Induan. Their body sizes increased slowly in the late Induan to Olenekian, but never recovered to the pre-extinction test size levels. The Lilliput effect on foraminifera in the aftermath of the end-Permian crisis is indicated by the extinction of large taxa, decrease in size for surviving taxa and rise of small-sized new forms. Physiological reactions of various foraminifer groups reveal that several defaunation events such as anoxia, ocean acidification, and global warming that prevailed through the Permian-Triassic interval may be responsible for both the end-Permian crisis and the Lilliput effect.

1,"Key message The increase in climate variability is likely to generate an increased occurrence of both frost-induced and drought-induced damages on perennial plants. We examined how these stress factors can potentially interact and would subsequently affect the vulnerability to each other. Furthermore, we discussed how this vulnerability could be modulated by shifts in the annual phenological cycle. Context The edges of plant distribution are strongly affected by abiotic constraints: heat waves and drought at low latitude and elevation, cold and frost at high latitude and elevation. The increase in climate variability will enhance the probability of extreme events and thus the potential interaction of stress factors. The initial exposure to a first constraint may affect the vulnerability to a subsequent one. Aims Although three integrative physiological processes, namely water balance, carbon metabolism and the timing of phenological stages, have largely been studied in the response of trees to a single constraint, their interaction has rarely been investigated. How would the interaction of frost and drought constraints modulate the vulnerability to a subsequent constraint and how vulnerability to a given constraint and phenology interact? Conclusion We suggest that the interaction between frost and drought constraints should in the short-term influence water balance and, in the longer term, carbon metabolism, both consequently affecting further vulnerability. However, this vulnerability can be modulated by shifts in the annual phenological cycle. Significant gaps of knowledge are reported in a mechanistic framework. This framework can help to improve the current process-based models integrating the life history of the individual plant."
1,"Wine is a significant contributor to the economies of many countries. However, the commodity can become contaminated with mycotoxins produced by certain fungi. Most information on mycotoxins in wine is from Spain, Italy and France. Grapes can be infected by mycotoxigenic fungi, of which Aspergillus carbonarius producing ochratoxln A (OTA) is of highest concern. Climate is the most important factor in determining contamination once the fungi are established, with high temperatures being a major factor for OTA contamination: OTA in wine is at higher concentrations in warmer southern Europe than northern. Contamination by fumonisins is a particular concern, related to Aspergillus tiger producing these compounds and the fungus being isolated frequently from grapes. Aflatoxins can be present in wine, but patulin is seldom detected. Altemaria mycotoxins (e.g. alternariol) have been frequently observed. There are indications that T-2 toxin may be common. Also, the combined effects of mycotoxins in wine require consideration. No other mycotoxins are currently of concern. Accurate fungal identifications and mycotoxin detection from the fungi are important and a consideration of practical methods are required. There is a diversity of wines that can be contaminated (e.g. red, white, sweet, dry and fortified). The occurrence of OTA is higher in red and sweet than white wines. Steps to control mycotoxins in wine involve good agriculture practices. The effect of climate change on vines and mycotoxins in wine needs urgent consideration by well-constructed modelling studies and expert interpretation of existing data. Reliable models of the effect of climate change on vines is a priority: the health of vines affects mycotoxin contamination. A modelling study of OTA in grapes at higher temperatures over 100 years is required. Progress has been made in reducing OTA in wine. The other mycotoxins require consideration and the effects of climate change will become crucial."
1,"A modeling framework is formulated and applied to assess the sensitivity of the hydrological regime of two catchments in a convective rainfall environment with respect to projected climate change. The study uses likely rainfall scenarios with high spatiotemporal resolution that are dependent on projected changes in the driving regional meteorological synoptic systems. The framework was applied to a case study in two medium-sized Mediterranean catchments in Israel, affected by convective rainfall, by combining the HiReS-WG rainfall generator and the SAC-SMA hydrological model. The projected climate change impact on the hydrological regime was examined for the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 emission scenarios, comparing the historical (beginning of the 21st century) and future (mid-21st-century) periods from three general circulation model simulations available from CMIP5. Focusing on changes in the occurrence frequency of regional synoptic systems and their impact on rainfall and streamflow patterns, we find that the mean annual rainfall over the catchments is projected to be reduced by 15% (outer range 2-23 %) and 18% (7-25 %) for the RCP4.5 sand RCP8.5 emission scenarios, respectively. The mean annual streamflow volumes are projected to be reduced by 45%(1060 %) and 47% (16-66 %). The average events' streamflow volumes for a given event rainfall depth are projected to be lower by a factor of 1.4-2.1. Moreover, the streamflow season in these ephemeral streams is projected to be shorter by 22% and 26-28% for the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively. The amplification in reduction of streamflow volumes relative to rainfall amounts is related to the projected reduction in soil moisture, as a result of fewer rainfall events and longer dry spells between rainfall events during the wet season. The dominant factors for the projected reduction in rainfall amount were the reduction in occurrence of wet synoptic systems and the shortening of the wet synoptic systems durations. Changes in the occurrence frequency of the two dominant types of the regional wet synoptic systems (active Red Sea trough and Mediterranean low) were found to have a minor impact on the total rainfall."
0,"Acanthocephalans' position in food webs, in close interaction with free-living species, could provide valuable information about freshwater ecosystem health through the viability of the parasites' host populations. We explored Pomphorhynchus laevis cystacanths' and adults' intensities of infection, and the prevalence of infected hosts respectively in their Gammarus pulex intermediate hosts and Squalius cephalus definitive hosts in a Mediterranean river. First, we analysed the relationship between P. laevis intensity of infection, its two hosts populations and the other acanthocephalan species found (Pomphorhynchus tereticollis and Polymorphus minutus). Second, we characterised the influence of bacteriological, physicochemical and biological water parameters on these acanthocephalans, and their intermediate and definitive hosts. This research highlights that P. laevis infection was closely related to their two preferential hosts population in the river. Moreover, P. laevis intensity of infection was positively correlated with organic pollution in the river but negatively correlated with biodiversity and with ecological indexes of quality. Pomphorhynchus laevis could thus benefit from moderate freshwater pollution, which promotes their tolerant intermediate and definitive hosts."
0,"Health, environmental, and animal advocacy organisations emphasise reducing or eliminating high meat consumption due to its adverse effects on health, sustainability, climate change, and animal welfare. Increasingly, people are deciding to reduce their meat consumption frequency. Our study aimed to examine predictors of meat reduction among Slovenian consumers, focusing on gender, age, partner and children status, size of residential settlement, socioeconomic status, and political orientation. We conducted a survey using non-probability sampling. We examined demographic, socioeconomic, and political predictors of individuals' self-assessed intent to reduce meat consumption in the month following the survey. Additionally, we analysed respondents' meat reduction during the three years prior. A correlation analysis revealed that higher age and education levels were significantly positively correlated with meat reduction patterns. An ordinal logistic regression analysis indicated that age was the only significant predictor of meat reduction intentions and past behaviour. Our findings suggest that middle-aged and elderly individuals are more likely than younger adults to report meat reduction behaviours. Future public health interventions should tailor approaches to different age groups, and, in particular, target younger individuals. Educational campaigns should highlight the health and environmental benefits of reducing meat and animal product consumption, particularly in primary and secondary schools."
1,"A change in climate would be expected to shift plant distribution as species expand in newly favorable areas and decline in increasingly hostile locations. We compared surveys of plant cover that were made in 1977 and 2006-2007 along a 2,314-m elevation gradient in Southern California's Santa Rosa Mountains. Southern California's climate warmed at the surface, the precipitation variability increased, and the amount of snow decreased during the 30-year period preceding the second survey. We found that the average elevation of the dominant plant species rose by approximate to 65 m between the surveys. This shift cannot be attributed to changes in air pollution or fire frequency and appears to be a consequence of changes in regional climate."
1,"Central Asia (CA) is one of the most arid places on Earth and climate change threatens to disrupt the natural hydrologic systems that store its limited annual wet-season precipitation in glaciers and release it during the dry season. Warm/Wet and Cold/Dry periods recorded over the last 2000 years using multiple paleoclimate proxy records reflect a local hydrocycle dominated by the Westerlies and moisture recycling within the Aral Sea catchment. The best tool for assessing recent climate trends is modern reanalysis modeling, ground-truthed by weather station data. Using the best-fit reanalysis, we find warming and drying trends have dominated the region over the last 115 years. Continued warming and drying in glacierized eastern CA during the critical spring season when glaciers typically increase in mass increase the likelihood that human infrastructure will be needed to impound wet-season precipitation.

0,"Of the approximately 30 extant species of pika (Ochotona; Ochotonidae; Lagomorpha), at least 23 occur in China. Of these, 8 are endemic, and 3 are classified as Endangered by the IUCN. Research into most Chinese species is scarce, and there is much to learn about basic aspects of their ecology. We reviewed the literature on the 23 Chinese Ochotona species, with the aim of highlighting knowledge gaps and biases in research allocation. Specifically, we identify (1) which pika species receive the most attention from researchers, (2) which topics are the most frequently studied, and (3) how well research satisfies conservation priorities. We covered a total of 879 articles, most of which were written in English or Chinese. Around 75% of all publications focused on the plateau pika Ochotona curzoniae. Seven species were represented by 10 or fewer publications each. Endangered and endemic species were particularly poorly represented. 204 papers treated pikas as a pest, while 13 studied conservation issues. Nine species were considered possible targets for pest control, including some poorly known endemics. We make some recommendations on how research into Chinese Ochotona could be improved, including: (1) recognizing that the current species-level taxonomy may be an ineffective way to prioritize conservation research in Ochotona, (2) directing more research toward threatened and endemic species, subspecies, and populations, (3) researching the ecosystem engineering effects of pikas, (4) collecting basic data on natural history of the many understudied species, and (5) researching threats, including climate change and pest control campaigns."
1,"Water stress is the main risk facing sugar beet production in Europe and is expected to worsen with climate change. Therefore, future production essentially depends on the traits that sustain growth during water shortages. In this study, we investigated the interplay of stomatal conductance and transpiration rate as well as the root characteristics of six sugar beet cultivars in a climate chamber experiment under environmental conditions progressing from a non-stressed initial state toward high atmospheric water demand, followed by reduced soil water supply and then by a combination of high demand and low supply. Stomatal conductance quickly responded to changing conditions, dropping from 406.4 to 42.5 mmol m-2 s-1, one order of magnitude, with the transition to reduced soil water availability. The transpiration rate showed a slightly delayed response compared with stomatal conductance, while we observed an inverse influence on the subsequent stomatal behavior exerted by the depletion/conservation of available soil water. The rooting pattern substantially differed among genotypes, predominantly at depths between 60 and 80 cm, where 50.5% of the root length was allocated. Longer roots buffered the effects of the reduction in stomatal conductance at the onset of water supply limitation, with 5.4 mmol m-2 s-1 higher conductance per 100 cm of root length. Therefore, breeding and/or management measures targeting root system vigor are the key to the growth maintenance of sugar beet during dry periods."
1,"Climate change increases the frequency and intensity of drought events, affecting soil functions including carbon sequestration and nutrient cycling, which are driven by growing microorganisms. Yet we know little about microbial responses to drought due to methodological limitations. Here, we estimate microbial growth rates in montane grassland soils exposed to ambient conditions, drought, and potential future climate conditions (i.e., soils exposed to 6 years of elevated temperatures and elevated CO2 levels). For this purpose, we combined O-18-water vapor equilibration with quantitative stable isotope probing (termed 'vapor-qSIP') to measure taxon-specific microbial growth in dry soils. In our experiments, drought caused >90% of bacterial and archaeal taxa to stop dividing and reduced the growth rates of persisting ones. Under drought, growing taxa accounted for only 4% of the total community as compared to 35% in the controls. Drought-tolerant communities were dominated by specialized members of the Actinobacteriota, particularly the genus Streptomyces. Six years of pre-exposure to future climate conditions (3 degrees C warming and + 300 ppm atmospheric CO2) alleviated drought effects on microbial growth, through more drought-tolerant taxa across major phyla, accounting for 9% of the total community. Our results provide insights into the response of active microbes to drought today and in a future climate, and highlight the importance of studying drought in combination with future climate conditions to capture interactive effects and improve predictions of future soil-climate feedbacks."
1,"Newly measured tree-ring series from 114 living and dead cypress Cupressus gigan-tea were collected from 2 high-elevation sites in the Langxian region in south Tibet, western China. Combined with 2 previous ring-width data sets from southern Tibet, the composite chronology correlated at 0.563 with instrumental precipitation over the 1961-2009 period. The low-frequency component of the chronology shows a higher correlation of 0.77 with instrumental data. We reconstructed the annual precipitation (July-June) from A. D. 1300 to 2010 for southern Tibet based on the scaling method. Wet conditions occurred in 1342-1391, 1383-1387, 1408-1423, 1453-1458, 1473-1492, 1508-1524, 1657-1667, 1701-1731, 1742-1768, 1781-1788, 1854-1868, 1917-1933, and 1994-2006, whereas dry years prevailed during 1388-1407, 1424-1452, 1459-1472, 1493-1507, 1525-1656, 1668-1700, 1732-1741, 1769-1780, 1789-1853, 1869-1916, and 1934-1993. Spatial correlation revealed that the annual precipitation reconstruction contained a strong regional precipitation signal for the southern Tibetan Plateau (TP). Coherent moisture variations on the southern TP over the past 700 yr were identified by comparison with other tree-ring-based drought reconstructions of the nearby regions. The reconstructed series showed that high (low) precipitation periods on the southern TP corresponded with dry (wet) spells on the northern TP during most of the past 500 yr, suggesting the influence of different moisture sources from the Westerlies and the south Asian summer monsoon on the northern and southern TP, respectively. The possible mechanism was related to the shift of the convergence shear line and a teleconnection of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) through controlling moisture via the Westerlies."
1,"Contemporary climate change is characterized both by increasing mean temperature and increasing climate variability such as heat waves, storms, and floods. How populations and communities cope with such climatic extremes is a question central to contemporary ecology and biodiversity conservation. Previous work has shown that species diversity can affect ecosystem functioning and resilience. Here, we show that genotypic diversity can replace the role of species diversity in a species-poor coastal ecosystem, and it may buffer against extreme climatic events. In a manipulative field experiment, increasing the genotypic diversity of the cosmopolitan seagrass Zostera marina enhanced biomass production, plant density, and faunal abundance, despite near-lethal water temperatures due to extreme warming across Europe. Net biodiversity effects were explained by genotypic complementarity rather than by selection of particularly robust genotypes. Positive effects on invertebrate fauna suggest that genetic diversity has second-order effects reaching higher trophic levels. Our results highlight the importance of maintaining genetic as well as species diversity to enhance ecosystem resilience in a world of increasing uncertainty."
1,"Anticipating the effect of climate change on biodiversity, in particular on changes in community composition, is crucial for adaptive ecosystem management(1) but remains a critical knowledge gap(2). Here, we use climate velocity trajectories(3), together with information on thermal tolerances and habitat preferences, to project changes in global patterns of marine species richness and community composition under IPCC Representative Concentration Pathways(4) (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5. Our simple, intuitive approach emphasizes climate connectivity, and enables us to model over 12 times as many species as previous studies(5,6). We find that range expansions prevail over contractions for both RCPs up to 2100, producing a net local increase in richness globally, and temporal changes in composition, driven by the redistribution rather than the loss of diversity. Conversely, widespread invasions homogenize present-day communities across multiple regions. High extirpation rates are expected regionally (for example, Indo-Pacific), particularly under RCP8.5, leading to strong decreases in richness and the anticipated formation of no-analogue communities where invasions are common. The spatial congruence of these patterns with contemporary human impacts(7,8) highlights potential areas of future conservation concern. These results strongly suggest that the millennial stability of current global marine diversity patterns, against which conservation plans are assessed, will change rapidly over the course of the century in response to ocean warming."
1,"Climate change will alter temperature and rainfall patterns over North American agricultural regions and there will be a need to adapt crop production systems to the altered conditions. A set of field experiments were conducted in south-western Quebec, Canada, with soybean (Glycine max L.), corn (Zea mays L.), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) x sudangrass (Sorghum sudanense Piper) hybrid and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) under two tillage and three nitrogen fertility regimes, to study their performance in three successive growing seasons (2001-2003), two of them with unusually warm and dry conditions. The annual crops were established in two tillage systems: conventional and no-till (NT). All crops except soybean were fertilized with three levels of nitrogen: corn - 0, 90 and 180 kg N ha(-1), sorghum-sudangrass - 0, 75 and 150 kg N ha(-1), switchgrass - 0, 30 and 60 kg N ha(-1). The 2001 and 2002 seasons were hotter and drier than the 2003 season, which was the most favourable for crop growth. The capacity of the crops to yield in dry seasons was as follow: switchgrass > sorghum-sudangrass > corn > soybean. The corn and sorghum-sudangrass responses to nitrogen fertilizer were low in 2001 due to the combined effect of dry growing season and coarse soil texture. Soybean did not perform well under NT. Corn yielded better at the highest nitrogen fertilizer rate under NT when the early season was warmer than the normal. Our results show that switchgrass and sorghum-sudangrass could be an option in south-western Quebec if the frequency of hot and dry seasons increase in the future, because of climate change."
1,"Approximately half of the world's ice-free ocean coastline is composed of sandy beaches, which support a higher level of recreational use than any other ecosystem. However, the contribution of sandy beaches to societal welfare is under increasing risk from local and non-local pressures, including expanding human development and climate-related stressors. These pressures are impairing the capacity of beaches to meet recreational demand, provide food, protect livelihoods, and maintain biodiversity and water quality. This will increase the likelihood of social-ecological collapses and regime shifts, such that beaches will sustain neither the original ecosystem function nor the related services and societal goods and benefits that they provide. These social-ecological systems at the land-sea interface are subject to market forces, weak governance institutions, and societal indifference: most people want a beach, but few recognize it as an ecosystem at risk."
1,"Recent reports show ethylene-dependent reductions in stomatal sensitivity to abscisic acid (ABA) under ozone stress. These changes reduce stomatal control of plant water loss in drying soil. Here we review evidence that ABA and ethylene, and interactions between these two stress-induced hormones, control many of the responses of intact plants to drought and ozone stress, with emphasis on effects on stomata and shoot growth. We draw attention to convergent signalling and response pathways induced by ozone and drought that can increase production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and nitric oxide (NO). Stomatal responses to a wider range of stresses and developmental cues may also be controlled via the same sets of signalling pathways. Other hormones, or effectors such as xylem/apoplastic pH or changes in plant water status, also play a role in signalling within and between organs. We discuss the implications, for crops, natural ecosystems and water catchment processes, of ethylene's antagonism of the stomatal response to ABA, against a back-drop of predictions for reduced precipitation and increasing ozone pollution, as part of global climate change and increasing urbanization and industrial development."
1,"Global Land Ice Measurements from Space (GLIMS) is an international consortium established to acquire satellite images of the world's glaciers.. analyse them for glacier extent and changes, and assess change data for causes and implications for people and the environment. Although GLIMS is making use of multiple remote-sensing systems, ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and reflection Radiometer) is optimized for many needed observations, including mapping of glacier boundaries and material facies, and tracking of surface dynamics., such as flow vector fields and supraglacial lake development. Software development by GLIMS is geared toward mapping clean-ice and debris-covered glaciers; terrain classification emphasizing snow, ice, water, and admixtures of ice with rock debris; multitemporal change analysis, visualization of images and derived data; and interpretation and archiving of derived data. A global glacier database has been designed at the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC, Boulder, Colorado); parameters are compatible with and expanded from those of the World Glacier Inventory (WGI). These technology efforts are summarized here, but will be presented in detail elsewhere. Our presentation here pertains to one broad question: How can ASTER and other satellite multispectral data be used to map, monitor, and characterize the state and dynamics of glaciers and to understand their responses to 20th and 21st century climate change? Our sampled results are not yet glaciologically or climatically representative. Our early results, while indicating complexity, are generally consistent with the glaciology community's conclusion that climate change is spurring glacier responses around the world (mainly retreat). Whether individual glaciers are advancing or retreating, the aggregate average of glacier change must be climatic in origin, as nonclimatic variations average out. We have discerned regional spatial patterns in glaciological response behavior; these patterns are best attributed to climate-change variability and to regional differences in glacier size and response times. In many cases, glacier length changes under-represent the magnitude of glacier ablation, because thinning (sometimes without immediate length changes) is also important. An expanded systematic, uniform analysis of many more glaciers is needed to isolate the glacier response components due to climatic and nonclimatic perturbations, to produce quantitative measures of regional variation in glacier changes, and to predict future regional glacier trends relevant to water resources, glaciological hazards, and global sea level. This comprehensive assessment (to be completed in stages) is expected to lend a critically needed filter to identify successful climate models that explain recent glacier changes and change patterns (and hence, are apt to describe future changes) and to eliminate unsuccessful models.

1,"Sea level rise resulting from climate change and land subsidence is expected to severely impact the duration and associated damage resulting from flooding events in tidal communities. These communities must continuously invest resources for the maintenance of existing structures and installation of new flood prevention infrastructure. Tide gates are a common flood prevention structure for low-lying communities in the tidal zone. Tide gates close during incoming tides to prevent inundation from downstream water propagating inland and open during outgoing tides to drain upland areas. Higher downstream mean sea level elevations reduce the effectiveness of tide gates by impacting the hydraulics of the system. This project developed a HECRAS and HECHMS model of an existing tide gate structure and its upland drainage area in the New Jersey Meadowlands to simulate the impact of rising mean sea level elevations on the tide gate's ability to prevent upstream flooding. Model predictions indicate that sea level rise will reduce the tide gate effectiveness resulting in longer lasting and deeper flood events. The results indicate that there is a critical point in the sea level elevation for this local area, beyond which flooding scenarios become dramatically worse and would have a significantly negative impact on the standard of living and ability to do business in one of the most densely populated areas of America."
1,"The coastal zone offers among the world's most productive and valuable ecosystems and is experiencing increasing pressure from anthropogenic impacts: human settlements, agriculture, aquaculture, trade, industrial activities, oil and gas exploitation and tourism. Earth observation has great capability to deliver valuable data at the local, regional and global scales and can support the assessment and monitoring of land- and water-related applications in coastal zones. Compared to optical satellites, cloud-cover does not limit the timeliness of data acquisition with spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors, which have all-weather, day and night capabilities. Hence, active radar systems demonstrate great potential for continuous mapping and monitoring of coastal regions, particularly in cloud-prone tropical and sub-tropical climates. The canopy penetration capability with long radar wavelength enables L-band SAR data to be used for coastal terrestrial environments and has been widely applied and investigated for the following geoscientific topics: mapping and monitoring of flooded vegetation and inundated areas; the retrieval of aboveground biomass; and the estimation of soil moisture. Human activities, global population growth, urban sprawl and climate change-induced impacts are leading to increased pressure on coastal ecosystems causing land degradation, deforestation and land use change. This review presents a comprehensive overview of existing research articles that apply spaceborne L-band SAR data for geoscientific analyses that are relevant for coastal land applications."
1,"Global mean sea level is a sensitive factor of climate change. Global warming will contribute to worldwide sea-level rise from thermal expansion of ocean water, melting of glaciers and polar ice. Consideration of global soil erosion, water vapor cycle, and hydraulic actions suggests that soil erosion is another important factor contributing to sea-level rise in addition to global warming. Much terrestrial sediment flows into the rivers each year but cannot be replenished, resulting in land surface declines. Moreover, sediment flow into rivers and oceans contributes to rising sea level. Ecological protection measure was proposed to prevent rising sea levels caused by soil erosion. This commentary should be useful to attract attention on rising sea levels caused by soil erosion."
0,"We integrate systems of measurement and modeling to improve estimation of uncertainties in above-ground biomass (AGB) derived from remote sensing. The outcome provides a unified starting point for the climate-change carbon community to assess uncertainty and sensitivity data and methodologies, and ultimately supports decision-making about which missions and instruments to develop for a desired cost/benefit ratio. Initial results include fusion of remote-sensing techniques (e. g., radar and lidar), uncertainties associated with measurement and modeling, and the impact of potential uncertainty correlations across aggregated unit areas. Biomass uncertainty estimates are presented at the single-hectare level for the forestlands of California. Using a forest biomass map of California, we calculate changes in variance (e. g., 2 orders of magnitude) as a function of uncertainty correlation assumptions, with correlations extending to spatial scales up to 100 km. Using a variogram formalism to derive the correlation shape and magnitude, we show that the estimated variance for California above-ground biomass is between 1% and 2% (1 standard deviation) for our current best estimate of the correlation range at 5-10 km-i.e., we bound the standard deviation by a factor of 2. This contrasts with 0.025% (1 standard deviation) if one does not include the correlation term. (C) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
1,"Plants in nature are constantly exposed to various stresses resulting from fluctuating environmental conditions which adversely affect their growth and development and may affect the performance of herbivores feeding on them. Drought and salinity are the most serious problems of agriculture due to climatic changes. According to global warming and drying of Urmia salty lake in Northwestern Iran which could result in salinization of agricultural lands nearby, the focus of this study was to examine the effect of two above mentioned stresses on a host plant and its pest population. Three levels of salinity (50 (low), 100 (intermediate) and 150 (high) mM NaCl) and water deficit (40-50% the amount of water given to control plants) were induced to common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) as stress factors and the following characteristics were measured: fresh and dry weight, leaf area, chlorophyll, carotenoid, proline and protein contents and CAT, APX and GPX enzyme activities. The life table parameters of two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch, reared on stress-induced plants were measured and compared with control. The high saline condition caused plant defoliation and was deleted from results. The low saline condition caused an increase in fresh weight and decrease in chlorophyll and protein contents of plant. Intermediate saline condition caused an increase in APX and CAT enzyme activities and decrease of dry weight, chlorophyll, protein and proline contents. Drought condition caused an increase of APX and GPX enzyme activities and proline content and decrease of dry weight and chlorophyll content. Analysis of life table data of T. urticae showed a significant decrease of net reproductive rate (R-0), mean generation time (T) and gross reproductive rate (GRR) of mites reared on plants under both of stresses. The intrinsic rate of increase (r) and finite rate of increase (lambda) decreased significantly only for mites reared on plants under intermediate saline condition."
1,"The aims of the research have been analysed the development vegetation in different elements of the seacoast landscape look for a relations between grassy and woody plan species, to foresee the tendencies of further landscape development. For the reason of deteriorating ecological conditions on the Lithuanian seacoast: i.e. climate change, rise of sea water level, frequent storms and even hurricanes, human economic activity, the flora of grassy and woody plants is getting scarcer, vegetation projections cover is decreasing, risk of wind erosion and seas abrasion is enhancing consequently the man made sand dunes are dwindling at a great rate. It has been established that in locations with intensive flow of holidaymakers a net of trodden paths is formed where the vegetation is disappearing very fast as there are suitable conditions for the springtime and autumn winds to erode the protective dune of the seaside. The trodden paths in a couple of years turn into 2 - 2,5 m wide sand drifting corridors, but the lies of the people become there 3 - 4 m wide pits and hollows. After these formations have interconnected they shape deflations of different size. The drifting sand carried by the prevailing winds swamp the beyond dune plain and the outskirts of the forests. The statistical analysis of projections cover of vegetation shows that during the last 27 years (from 1982) the conditions for flora survival on the mainland seacoast sand dunes are gradually deteriorating."
1,"Crops under climate change will be simultaneously exposed to multiple stresses of biotic and abiotic nature. To control rice bacterial blight (BB), near-isogenic lines carrying Xa genes were previously developed, while rice near isogenic lines (NILs) with drought yield QTLs (qDTY) were selected for rice yield improvement under drought conditions. In this study, the response of 17 rice lines to simultaneous BB and drought stresses were evaluated in screenhouse trials and field trials to evaluate their response to exposure to BB and drought simultaneously. Under drought stress, qDTY NILs with their shorter growing period were less affected, while IR24 and IRBB4 showed growth reduction and inhibition of flowering under field conditions. NILs with BB resistance (R) Xa gene alone showed resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) strains carrying the corresponding avirulence gene, except in genotype IRBB4 with the Xa4 R gene that, although resistant, showed a significant increase in disease severity under drought stress after inoculation with Xoo strain PXO61 (avrXa4) compared to irrigated conditions. IR64 introgression lines (IR87705-6-9-B, IR87707-445-B-B-B, IR87707-446-B-B-B) with the combination of the Xa4 R gene and qDTY showed resistance to Xoo strains PXO61 (avrXa4) and PXO145 (avrXa4) under irrigated conditions but were less resistant under drought. Vandana qDTY NILs were susceptible to all Xoo strains under both irrigated and drought stress conditions, but were more resistant under drought. These results highlight the wide genotypic variation among rice lines in response to BB under drought stress and the advantage of trait combinations (Xa+qDTY) to confer drought tolerance and BB resistance under unfavorable future climate conditions.

1,"Global warming may exacerbate cropland soil drought, affect microbial systems, and decrease grain yield. However, the compensatory effects of supplementary irrigation on winter wheat yield and soil microbial communities under increased temperatures have not been fully studied. Here, a three-year field experiment was conducted, to verify the effects of warming treatments (WS: winter and spring warming; FF: flowering and filling period warming) and irrigation (W0: conventional irrigation; W1: supplemental irrigation) on crop-soil systems during the winter wheat growth stages. The results demonstrated that warming measures have significant negative effects on the net assimilation rate of flag leaves and yield formation, which led to a reduction of wheat yield by 14-40%. However, increasing irrigation can compensate for a yield of 9.7-15%. In addition, warming increases the soil temperature and decreases the soil water content, resulting in decreased soil microbial diversity. The effect size (beta) = -0.23 to -0.53 for index of phylogenetic diversity (PD) under warming, while beta= 0.16 under increased irrigation. The SEM model further showed that supplementary irrigation during anthesis to filling can improve the soil environment and extend the validity of photosynthetic to increase production, which was an important mitigation measure to adapt to the warming climate in wheat production."
1,"Of concern to Colorado River management, as operating guidelines post-2026 are being considered, is whether water resource recovery from low flows during 2000-20 is possible. Here, we analyze new simulations from phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) to determine plausible climate impacts on Colorado River flows for 2026-50 when revised guidelines would operate. We constrain projected flows for Lees Ferry, the gauge through which 85% of the river flow passes, using its estimated sensitivity to meteorological variability together with CMIP6-projected precipitation and temperature changes. The critical importance of precipitation, especially its natural variability, is emphasized. Model projections indicate increased precipitation in the upper Colorado River basin due to climate change, which alone increases river flows by 5%-7% (relative to a 2000-20 climatology). Depending on the river's temperature sensitivity, this wet signal compensates for some, if not all, of the depleting effects of basin warming. Considerable internal decadal precipitation variability (;5% of the climatological mean) is demonstrated, driving a greater range of plausible Colorado River flow changes for 2026-50 than previously surmised from treatment of temperature impacts alone: the overall precipitation-induced Lees Ferry flow changes span from -25% to 140%, contrasting with a range from -30% to -5% from expected warming effects only. Consequently, extreme low and high flows are more likely. Lees Ferry flow projections, conditioned on initial drought states akin to 2000-20, reveal substantial recovery odds for water resources, albeit with elevated risks of even further flow declines than in recent decades."
1,"Under the background of climate change, droughts have occurred widely and frequently in North China in recent years. Using tree-ring to study droughts has advantages such as accurate dating, strong continuity and high resolution. This paper uses the Chinese pine ring-width of Xiaowutai Mountain, China, to analyze the correlations between the ring-width and climatic factors. The results show that the standard and residual chronologies of Chinese pine have significant correlations between spring precipitation, 0 cm ground temperature in May, average relative humidity of April and May, hours of sunshine and percentage of sunshine in May, and Z index of spring. The Chinese pine ring-width is fundamentally affected by the precipitation of the study area. 0 cm ground temperature, average relative humidity and hours of sunshine all affect the ring-width by affecting the soil water content indirectly. The years when the Chinese pine ring-width index of Xiaowutai Mountain falls into 0-0.80 could indicate spring drought years. This paper has demonstrated the feasibility of applying tree-rings to study the spatial and temporal development of drought in the study area. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved."
1,"Gracilariopsis lemaneiformis, one of the principal economical seaweeds in China, has been increasingly threatened by diseases and yield reduction due to heat stress caused by global warming. Reportedly, chitooligosaccharides (COS) can be used as an elicitor to induce the defense response of terrestrial plants. This study aimed to investigate the possibility of using COS as an elicitor to induce the stress resistance of G. lemaneiformis under heat stress. The present results showed that COS can relieve the adverse effects of high temperatures on G. lemaneiformis. After treatment with different concentrations of COS, the relative growth rate (RGR) of G. lemaneiformis was remarkably improved, while its level of lipid peroxidation was significantly decreased under heat stress. To illustrate the response mechanism of G. lemaneiformis to COS, a comparative transcriptome analysis was performed, which revealed COS-responsive differentially expressed genes and metabolic pathways after 24 and 48 h of heat stress treatment. COS elicitation was able to activate signal transduction, particularly in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades and phosphatidylinositol signaling system, which might further regulate the photosynthesis, energy metabolism and antioxidant systems in G. lemaneiformis. Meanwhile, alpha linolenic acid metabolism, associated with the synthesis of jasmonates, was also responsive to COS, indicating that jasmonates may be involved in COS-mediated defense responses in G. lemaneiformis. Furthermore, the transcriptome results were in general consistent with the changes in physiological parameters associated with photosynthesis and antioxidant systems. These findings can facilitate our understanding of the molecular mechanisms on the heat tolerance of G. lemaneiformis and provide a new viewpoint for the future breeding of thermotolerant G. lemaneiformis."
1,"Ocean acidification will likely change the structure and function of coastal marine ecosystems over coming decades. Volcanic carbon dioxide seeps generate dissolved CO2 and pH gradients that provide realistic insights into the direction and magnitude of these changes. Here, we used fish and benthic community surveys to assess the spatio-temporal dynamics of fish community properties off CO2 seeps in Japan. Adding to previous evidence from ocean acidification ecosystem studies conducted elsewhere, our findings documented shifts from calcified to non-calcified habitats with reduced benthic complexity. In addition, we found that such habitat transition led to decreased diversity of associated fish and to selection of those fish species better adapted to simplified ecosystems dominated by algae. Our data suggest that near-future projected ocean acidification levels will oppose the ongoing range expansion of coral reef-associated fish due to global warming. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

1,"The spatial tracking of climatic shifts is frequently reported as a biodiversity response to climatic change. However, species' range shifts are often idiosyncratic and inconsistent with climatic shift predictions. At the community scale, this discrepancy can be measured by comparing the spatial shift in the relative composition of cold-vs. warm-adapted species in a local assemblage [the community temperature index (CTI)] with the spatial shift in temperature isotherms. While the local distribution of climate change velocity is a promising approach to downscaling climate change pressure and responses, CTI velocity has only been investigated on a continental or national scale. In this study, we coupled French Breeding Bird Survey data, collected from 2133 sites monitored between 2001 and 2012, with climatic data in order to estimate the local magnitude and direction of breeding season temperature shift, CTI shift, and their spatiotemporal divergence - the local climatic debt. We also tested whether landscape characteristics that are known to affect climate velocity and spatial tracking of climate change mediated the climatic debt on the local scale. We found a clear spatial structure, together with heterogeneity in both temperature and CTI spatial shifts. Local climatic debt decreased as the elevation, habitat diversity, and the naturalness of the landscape increased. These results suggest the complementary effects of the local topographic patterns sheltering more diverse microclimates and the increasing permeability of natural and diversified landscape. Our findings suggest that a more nuanced evaluation of spatial variability in climatic and biotic shifts is necessary in order to properly describe biodiversity responses to climate change rather than the oversimplified descriptions of uniform poleward shifts."
1,"In the coming decades, ensuring food security is one of the greatest challenges in Ethiopia. Most Ethiopians practice mixed agricultural activity which represents about 33.88% of country's GDP. Therefore, this paper is devoted to reviewing the existing agricultural challenges and future prospects in the country. Majorly, it focused on the shortage of farmland, climate change, fragmentation and degradation of farmland, unevenly distributed constructions and urbanizations, pests, lack of integration among stakeholders, political instabilities, and its prospects. Despite the numerous challenges, Ethiopia has marvelous opportunities like the commercialization of fruit, vegetable, and ornamental plant productions. The country has also ample opportunity in the areas of animal production that ranks first in Africa in the number of livestock heads. The country has a huge labor force and water resources. It is proximity to Middle East markets is valuable to transport fresh products within a short period of time to the needed destination. However, Ethiopia's current fruit, vegetable, and animal production for export are very limited because of fragmented cultivation and lack of quality. The country has also a great variety of climate and soil types that enables it to grow a diversity of horticultural crops. Therefore, emphasizing agriculture in Ethiopia requires the political as well as the economic commitment of all parties concerned."
1,"Drought has large impacts on the vegetation growth of global terrestrial ecosystems, particularly grasslands. Extensive in-situ studies have shown that the impact of drought on vegetation growth has lagged and cumulative effects, but it is not well known how grassland productivity (gross primary production or GPP) responds to drought over time at large scales. Here, we investigated the spatiotemporal patterns of lagged and cumulative effects of drought on global grassland GPP using an OCO-2 solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) based GPP product (GOSIF GPP) and the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). The results showed that globally, 88.37% of the grassland had a lagged response to drought, with a lagged time scale of mainly 1 month. With the increase in soil water availability, the magnitude of the lagged effect gradually weakened. Grasslands in semiarid and semi humid conditions that were adaptable to periodic drought responded fastest to drought. Globally, more than three quarters (78.55%) of the grassland was affected by the cumulative effect of drought. The accumulated months occurred at longer time scales (8 similar to 10 months) for the region at 40 degrees N-55 degrees N, which is relatively arid. The cumulative effect in relatively arid areas was stronger than that in relatively humid areas, indicating that grasslands in more arid areas had stronger tolerance to drought. More importantly, we found that the cumulative effect of drought on grassland GPP was stronger than the lagged effect. This study highlights the great importance of considering the legacy effect, especially the cumulative effect, of drought on grassland productivity, which would advance our understanding of the impact of climate change on the carbon and water cycles of terrestrial ecosystems."
0,"The multi-scale approach to conserving forest biodiversity has been used in Sweden since the 1980s, a period defined by increased reserve area and conservation actions within production forests. However, two thousand forest-associated species remain on Sweden's red-list, and Sweden's 2020 goals for sustainable forests are not being met. We argue that ongoing changes in the production forest matrix require more consideration, and that multi-scale conservation must be adapted to, and integrated with, production forest development. To make this case, we summarize trends in habitat provision by Sweden's protected and production forests, and the variety of ways silviculture can affect biodiversity. We discuss how different forestry trajectories affect the type and extent of conservation approaches needed to secure biodiversity, and suggest leverage points for aiding the adoption of diversified silviculture. Sweden's long-term experience with multi-scale conservation and intensive forestry provides insights for other countries trying to conserve species within production landscapes."
1,"The Kabul River Basin (KRB) in Afghanistan is densely inhabited and heterogenic. The basin's water resources are limited, and climate change is anticipated to worsen this problem. Unfortunately, there is a scarcity of data to measure the impacts of climate change on the KRB's current water resources. The objective of the current study is to introduce a methodology that couples remote sensing and the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) for simulating the impact of climate change on the existing water resources of the KRB. Most of the biophysical parameters required for the SWAT model were derived from remote sensing-based algorithms. The SUFI-2 technique was used for calibrating and validating the SWAT model with streamflow data. The stream-gauge stations for monitoring the streamflow are not only sparse, but the streamflow data are also scarce and limited. Therefore, we selected only the stations that are properly being monitored. During the calibration period, the coefficient of determination (R-2) and Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) were 0.75-0.86 and 0.62-0.81, respectively. During the validation period (2011-2013), the NSE and R-2 values were 0.52-0.73 and 0.65-0.86, respectively. The validated SWAT model was then used to evaluate the potential impacts of climate change on streamflow. Regional Climate Model (RegCM4-4) was used to extract the data for the climate change scenarios (RCP 4.5 and 8.5) from the CORDEX domain. The results show that streamflow in most tributaries of the KRB would decrease by a maximum of 5% and 8.5% under the RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios, respectively. However, streamflow for the Nawabad tributary would increase by 2.4% and 3.3% under the RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios, respectively. To mitigate the impact of climate change on reduced/increased surface water availability, the SWAT model, when combined with remote sensing data, can be an effective tool to support the sustainable management and strategic planning of water resources. Furthermore, the methodological approach used in this study can be applied in any of the data-scarce regions around the world."
1,"Determining the main factors causing urban tree decline is becoming essential for sustaining their health and survival. Understanding responses of tree growth to urban environments and climate change throughout tree life span is thus necessary. To explore these questions, a dendrochronological study exploring past climate-tree growth relationships was conducted on street and park silver lindens in Paris, according to different DBH classes used as a proxy of tree age, and using climatic data for the 1970-2013 period. Younger urban silver lindens presented high sensitivity to climate with highest growth rate. In comparison with park trees, street trees had higher sensitivity to climate and lower growth rates. Climatic and pointer years analysis pointed out the importance of drought characterization in order to understand its potential impact on tree annual growth and functioning. Urban silver lindens growth is mainly and strongly correlated with precipitations and especially in autumn and spring. Finally, our study on temporal evolution between climatic factors and growth through 1970-2013 periods showed a stronger stability between growth and precipitation only in October and revealed quick climatic changes since 40 years impacting the relation between tree growth and climate. Our study highlights that an optimized irrigation management, specifically in respect of tree phenology, could contribute to maximizing silver linden functioning and survival in Paris under climate change."
0,"Artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) is increasingly damaging forest, land, and water resources, and this occurrence is rapidly gaining the attention of interest groups across the globe. Our paper contributes to the global discussion of this mining induced devastation with data from Ghana. Based on Landsat data, ASM degraded sites in seven administrative regions that have a long history of mining in the country are identified, mapped, and digitized. Results show that ASM has degraded more than 78,000 ha of forest and land with an attendant water pollution in the last two decades. The paper further explores the implications of this crucial finding for environmental sustainability and community wellbeing and introduces a conceptual model, ASM-Environmental Vulnerability Web, that describes the various means through which mining induced degradation affects environmental quality, livelihoods, food security, and community sustainability. The paper argues that the current trend of ASM exhibits attributes that are like those of the gold rush era in the 19th century, emphasizing that irresponsible mining practices have significant ramifications for the ecosystem and undermine sustainable development."
1,"The Amazon is Brazil's greatest natural resource and invaluable to the rest of the world as a buffer against climate change. The recent election of Brazil's president brought disputes over development plans for the region back into the spotlight. Historically, the development model for the Amazon has focused on exploitation of natural resources, resulting in environmental degradation, particularly deforestation. Although considerable attention has focused on the long-term global cost of losing the Amazon, too little attention has focused on the emergence and reemergence of vector-borne diseases that directly impact the local population, with spillover effects to other neighboring areas. We discuss the impact of Amazon development models on human health, with a focus on vector-borne disease risk. We outline policy actions that could mitigate these negative impacts while creating opportunities for environmentally sensitive economic activities."
1,"A thorough understanding of the complex response of hydrologic processes to latent factors is of great significance for regional soil erosion and water resources management. However, what kind of mediation effect exists between hydrologic processes and latent factors is not yet clear, especially in heterogeneous karst regions. In this study, the elasticity coefficient method and partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) were used to investigate the mechanism of latent factors on hydrologic processes in karst basins and to explore the mediation effect between latent factors and hydrologic processes. The results show that the runoff of Yeji River Basin decreased during 1997-2004, but increased or stabilized since 2005. On the monthly scale, the runoff in July and December showed an 'inverted V-shaped' change. Both elasticity coefficient method and PLS-SEM showed that climate change contributed the most to runoff (direct effect accounted for 37.94% similar to 61.41%). In PLS-SEM, the total effect sizes of latent factors on runoff were as follows: climate change (0.751 similar to 0.963) > vegetation (0.296 similar to 0.740) > karst characteristics factors (KCF) (-0.454 similar to -0.563) > human activities (-0.036 similar to -0.528) > land use and cover change (LUCC) (-0.036 similar to -0.205). In the typical karst basin, two mediation pathways have been determined: human activities-vegetation/LUCC-runoff, where vegetation and LUCC had a mediation effect of relationships between human activities and runoff; climate change-KCF-runoff, where KCF had a mediation effect of relationships between climate change and runoff. Moreover, PLS-SEM is a preferred method to decouple the complex responses of hydrologic processes in heterogeneous karst basins to climate change and human activities than the elasticity coefficient method. This study conducted further research and exploration on the mechanism of hydrologic processes in heterogeneous karst basins, and provided valuable theoretical references for grassroots water managers to cope with water resources management under the context of future climate change."
1,"The global network of subsea fibre-optic cables plays a critical role in the world economy and is considered as strategic infrastructure for many nations. Sediment density flows have caused significant disruption to this network in the recent past. These cable breaks represent the only means to actively monitor such flows over large oceanic regions. Here, we use a global cable break database to analyse tropical cyclone triggering of sediment density flows worldwide over 25 yrs. Cable breaking sediment density flows are triggered in nearly all areas exposed to tropical cyclones but most occur in the NW Pacific. They are triggered by one of three sets of mechanisms. Tropical cyclones directly trigger flows, synchronous to their passage, as a consequence of storm waves, currents and surges. Cyclones also trigger flows indirectly, with near-synchronous timing to their passage, as a consequence of peak flood discharges. Last, cyclones trigger flows after a delay of days as a consequence of the failure of large volumes of rapidly deposited sediment. No clear relationship emerges between tropical cyclone activity (i.e. track, frequency and intensity) and the number of sediment density flows triggered. This is a consequence of the short period of observation. However, expansion of the cable network and predicted changes to cyclone activity in specific regions increases the likelihood of increasing numbers of damaging flows. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

1,"Mesoamerican biodiversity is increasingly threatened by anthropogenic destruction of natural land cover. Habitat degradation and climate change are primary threats to specialized forest odonate species that are important model organisms for forest health and defining conservation units. The extreme niche specialization of Megaloprepus caerulatus, the world's largest extant odonate, makes it well suited as an indicator for changing environmental conditions. Megaloprepus, which is considered to be a monospecific genus, is highly dependent on old growth forests whose water filled tree holes are limiting reproductive resources for this species. Here, we focus on the question how historical and recent fragmentation events, strong niche conservatism and ecological conditions have affected population dynamics, viability and the species status in this evolutionarily old genus. Two mitochondrial sequence markers (ND1 and 16S rRNA) and a set of microsatellites were used to analyze population structure and genetic diversity of M. caerulatus in the northern part of its distributional range. Results suggested an absence of gene flow and no shared haplotypes among the study populations. Statistical parsimony indicated high sub-structuring among populations with sequence diversity similar to levels found at the species level compared to other odonates. In sum, the genetic data suggest that Megaloprepus may actually consist of more than one species. The taxonomic status of the group should be revised in light of the three distinct genetic clusters found in different forest regions. The results may also allow insights into the impact of recent and historical habitat fragmentation on a strong Neotropical forest restricted insect species."
1,"Climate change impacts on food supply and water use efficiency have become an urgent issue for the agricultural researchers and governments. With climate change, water resources will be a restricting factor for agriculture, especially in arid and semi-arid areas. This paper mainly discusses the changing tendency of water balance components, maize yield and water use indices under rainfed and irrigated conditions in subareas of the Loess Plateau under the A2 and B2 scenarios with the SWAGMAN (R) Destiny model. The results show that evapotranspiration will increase in future for both rainfed and irrigated maize under both scenarios. The water use indices mentioned in this paper have the same tendency under both scenarios in the same subareas, but variability under the A2 scenario is higher than that under B2. The crop yield and water use indices will decrease for rainfed maize production in the whole Loess Plateau. With irrigation, crop yield will increase in Clay Loam-2 and Clay Loam-1 while it will decrease in Light Loam and Sandy Loam under the A2 scenario and B2 scenarios in 2020, 2050 and 2080 respectively. The evapotranspiration efficiency and ratio of evapotranspiration and irrigation under irrigated maize will increase in Clay Loam-2, Clay Loam-1, Light Loam and Sandy Loam under both scenarios. Crop water use efficiency, irrigation water use efficiency and total water use efficiency will decrease under the A2 and B2 scenarios during irrigated maize growth. Therefore, for the rainfed crop, it is necessary to improve water harvesting technology so as to meet the increasing crop water requirements with climate change; while, for the irrigated crop, it is vital to enhance soil water capacity in order to make good use of the irrigated water.

1,"Water development has threatened the ecological integrity of riverine ecosystems. Increasing water demand, persistent drought, and climate change exacerbate the effects of habitat degradation and loss in altered systems such as the Colorado River basin. Today, biologists are challenged to identify management actions that benefit native fishes while not hindering water development or management. Herein, we discuss the importance of the natural flow regime for functioning riverine ecosystems and provide examples from four tributaries to the Green River, a major headwater branch of the Colorado River. These tributaries represent a gradient of impacts ranging from water abstraction to the point of complete seasonal desiccation to a relatively natural flow regime, and consequently have maintained different levels of instream habitat complexity and native fish persistence. Despite decades of management, endangered species lack self-sustaining populations and other native species have been extirpated from over half their ranges, which begs the question: can water development and fish conservation be balanced under current water laws and climate change-driven declines in runoff? Given the continued decline in freshwater biodiversity and abundance occurring across the globe, we contend that immediate designation of rivers with natural flow regimes as freshwater conservation areas will enhance native species recovery."
1,"The Colorado River supplies water to seven southwestern states and Mexico. It is one of the most stressed river systems in the US. To address sustainability in the Lower Colorado River Basin (LCRB), the US Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) organized discussion of river operations and diversions among the LCRB states, eventually leading to the 2007 Interim Guidelines (2007-IG) and then to a revised river management structure, the 2019 Drought Contingency Plan (DCP). Among other features, the DCP increased the severity of reductions, or shortages, in annual water deliveries to the LCRB states (California, Arizona, and Nevada) and Mexico that are triggered by low year-end water levels in Lake Mead. Shortage measures were designed to mitigate the effects of long-term southwestern drought on reservoir levels, perhaps avoiding the worst outcomes for regional water supply while maintaining the energy-generating capability of the Colorado River system. The objective of this study was to evaluate water supply reliability in the LCRB with and without DCP measures and with and without anticipated climate effects. Four combinations of hydrological conditions and management strategies were analyzed. The results show that both 2007-IG and DCP measures will reduce the most severe shortages in Colorado River Water (CRW) supply to the LCRB states and Mexico under historical hydrologic conditions. Neither set of regulating measures insulates the LCRB against drought with anticipated climate change. However, the most distressing low-water projections are predicted to be less frequent and severe with DCP measures in place. The methods used to project the impacts attributable to climate change and the DCP on LCRB water deliveries can be used to anticipate the effects of alternative river management provisions now under consideration for drought mitigation."
1,"Aquaculture has proven to be a vital and very efficient source of animal protein to meet the food demands of the ongoing increase in the global human population. In response to the rising accumulation of atmospheric greenhouse gases (GHG), principally of anthropomorphic origin from use of fossil fuel energy sources, global oceanic and atmospheric temperatures have risen to cataclysmic levels that have produced dramatic changes in climate. Aquaculture, like all animal production systems is a contributor to global GHG, and strategies must be introduced to mitigate current and future threats of climatic disruptions. Important pathways to reduce carbon footprint contributions include increases in efficiency of production and appropriate choice of ingredients for manufacture of sustainable aquafeed. For fed production systems, use of feed grade rather than food grade sources of ingredients must typically predominate. Additionally, use of waste consistent with circular bioeconomy concepts and the guidance provided through results of life cycle assessment (LCA) must be applied to aquafeed production. An integral connection of these efforts with a timely transformation from use of fossil fuel to renewable sources of energy is essential. Achieving sufficient reductions in both aquaculture's carbon footprint and fossil fuel use within the next 25 years should determine whether the projected contribution of aquaculture to global food security is realized."
1,"Extreme weather events pose an immediate threat to biodiversity, but existing conservation strategies have limitations. Advances in meteorological forecasting and innovation in the humanitarian sector provide a possible solution-forecast-based action (FbA). The growth of ecological forecasting demonstrates the huge potential to anticipate conservation outcomes, but a lack of operational examples suggests a new approach is needed to translate forecasts into action. FbA provides such a framework, formalizing the use of meteorological forecasts to anticipate and mitigate the impacts of extreme weather. Based on experience from the humanitarian sector, I suggest how FbA could work in conservation, demonstrating key concepts using the theoretical example of heatwave impacts on sea turtle embryo mortality, and address likely challenges in realizing FbA for conservation, including establishing a financing mechanism, allocating funds to actions, and decision-making under uncertainty. FbA will demand changes in conservation research, practice, and governance. Researchers must increase efforts to understand the impacts of extreme weather at more immediate and actionable timescales and should coproduce forecasts of such impacts with practitioners. International conservation funders should establish systems to fund anticipatory actions based on uncertain forecasts."
1,"Many studies have focused on the impacts of climate change on biological assemblages, yet little is known about how climate interacts with other major anthropogenic influences on biodiversity, such as habitat disturbance. Using a unique global database of 1128 local ant assemblages, we examined whether climate mediates the effects of habitat disturbance on assemblage structure at a global scale. Species richness and evenness were associated positively with temperature, and negatively with disturbance. However, the interaction among temperature, precipitation and disturbance shaped species richness and evenness. The effect was manifested through a failure of species richness to increase substantially with temperature in transformed habitats at low precipitation. At low precipitation levels, evenness increased with temperature in undisturbed sites, peaked at medium temperatures in disturbed sites and remained low in transformed sites. In warmer climates with lower rainfall, the effects of increasing disturbance on species richness and evenness were akin to decreases in temperature of up to 9 degrees C. Anthropogenic disturbance and ongoing climate change may interact in complicated ways to shape the structure of assemblages, with hot, arid environments likely to be at greatest risk."
1,"In the summer of 2003, a heat wave swept Europe and caused more than 70 000 additional fatalities [J.-M. Robine et al., C. R. Biologies331 (2008)]. Global warming and climate change is no longer a prophecy to be fulfilled, as strong heat waves and typhoons, as well as severe rainfalls, are becoming more severe. Extreme weather and climate events in the world, especially over Europe and North America, are widely studied and frequently reported in the media. These events may be related to the ongoing climate change. In this NSR forum, active researchers specialized in this field gather to discuss the climate and weather changes in China. They present the current changes, identify knowledge gaps, discuss the research difficulties, and propose ways forward to better serve the society with climate science."
1,"Tarim River basin is the largest endorheic river basin in China. Due to the extremely arid climate the water supply solely depends on water originating from the glacierised mountains with about 75% stemming from the transboundary Aksu River. The water demand is linked to anthropogenic (specifically agriculture) and natural ecosystems, both competing for water. Ongoing climate change significantly impacts the cryosphere. The mass balance of the glaciers in Aksu River basin was clearly negative since 1975. The discharge of the Aksu headwaters has been increasing over the last decades mainly due to the glacier contribution. The average glacier melt contribution to total runoff is 30-37% with an estimated glacier imbalance contribution of 8-16%. Modelling using future climate scenarios indicate a glacier area loss of at least 50% until 2100. River discharge will first increase concomitant with glacier shrinkage until about 2050, but likely decline thereafter. The irrigated area doubled in the Aksu region between the early 1990s and 2020, causing at least a doubling of water demand. The current water surplus is comparable to the glacial runoff. Hence, even if the water demand will not grow further in the future a significant water shortage can be expected with declining glacial runoff. However, with the further expansion of irrigated agriculture and related industries, the water demand is expected to even further increase. Both improved discharge projections and planning of efficient and sustainable water use are necessary for further socioeconomic development in the region along with the preservation of natural ecosystems."
0,"Outer facade finishes affect the energy balance in buildings and thermal conditions in urban environments. To rise to the challenges presently posed by climate change, strategies must be designed to reduce energy demand, mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and adapt the urban environment. As a substantial part of building envelopes, facades also play a predominant role in consolidated cities, for they impact thermal balance while also defining the outdoor space. Three optical parameters (colour, solar reflectance and emissivity) are studied to characterise the surface properties of enclosures and analyse their effect on three construction systems: the standard enclosure found on buildings in Madrid and two solutions to improve its thermal performance via energy rehabilitation. The findings show that since the surface features of elements govern temperature on outer facade surfaces, suitable design can lower the energy demand for thermal conditioning and improve both indoor and outdoor urban habitability.

1,"Individuals living in every region of the world are increasingly vulnerable to negative health outcomes due to extreme heat exposure. Children, in particular, may face long-term consequences associated with heat stress that affect their educational attainment and later life health and well-being. Retrospective individual-level analyses are useful for determining the effects of extreme heat exposure on health outcomes. Typically, future risk is inferred by extrapolating these effects using future warming scenarios that are applied uniformly over space and time without consideration of topographical or climatological gradients. We propose an alternative approach using a stochastic weather generator. This approach employs a 1 degrees C warming scenario to produce an ensemble of plausible future weather scenarios, and subsequently a distribution of future health risks. We focus on the effect of global warming on fetal development as measured by birth weight in Ethiopia. We demonstrate that predicted changes in birth weight are sensitive to the evolution of temperatures not quantified in a uniform warming scenario. Distributions of predicted changes in birth weight vary in magnitude and variability depending on geographic and socioeconomic region. We present these distributions alongside results from the uniform warming scenario and discuss the spatiotemporal variability of these predicted changes."
1,"Predicted effects of anthropogenic climate change on estuarine and coastal organisms are complex, and early life history stages of calcified ectotherms are amongst the most sensitive groups. Despite the importance of understanding their vulnerability, we lack information on the effects of multiple stressors on the embryonic development of estuarine and burrowing organisms, mainly mangrove-associated species. Here, we determined the combined effects of elevated temperature and decreased pH on the embryonic development of the estuarine fiddler crab Leptuca thayeri. Initially, the microhabitat (burrow) of ovigerous (egg-bearing) females was measured for temperature, pH, and salinity, which provided control values in our laboratory experiment. Embryos at the early stage of development were subjected to cross-factored treatments of predicted temperature and pH and evaluated for development rate, survivorship, and volume until their later embryonic stage. Embryo development was faster at early and later stages of development, and survivorship was lower under elevated temperature. Embryos under reduced pH showed advanced embryonic stages at their late development stage. Higher egg volume was observed in a warmer and acidified environment, and lower volume in warmer and non-acidified conditions, indicating that embryo development is synergistically affected by warming and acidification. More than 70% of embryos developed until late stages under the multiple-stressors treatment, giving insights on the effects of a warm and acidified environment on burrowing estuarine organisms and their early stages of development."
1,"Climate change scenarios predict that an extended period of drought is a real threat to food security, emphasizing the need for new crops that tolerate these conditions. Quinoa is the best option because it has the potential to grow under water deficit conditions. There is considerable variation in drought tolerance in quinoa genotypes, and the selection of drought-tolerant quinoa germplasms is of great interest. The main goal of this work is to evaluate the crop yield and characterize the physiology of 20 quinoa genotypes grown under water deficit in a wirehouse. The experiment was a complete randomized design (CRD) factorial with three replications. Seedling growth, i.e., fresh weight (FW), dry weight (DW), root length (RL), shoot length (SL), relative growth rate of root length (RGR-RL), shoot length (RGR-SL), and physiological performance, i.e., chlorophyll content (a and b), carotenoid, leaf phenolic content, leaf proline content, membrane stability index (MSI), and leaf K+ accumulation were evaluated in a hydroponic culture under different water-deficit levels developed by PEG 6000 doses (w/v) of 0% (control), 0.3%, and 0.6%. Yield attributes were evaluated in a pot at three different soil moisture levels, as determined by soil gravimetric water holding capacity (WHC) of 100 (control), 50% WHC (50 % drought stress) and 25% WHC (75% stress). In both experiments, under the water stress condition, the growth (hydroponic study) and yield traits (pot study) were significantly reduced compared to control treatments. On the drought tolerance index (DTI) based on seed yield, genotype 16 followed by 10, 1, 4, 5, 7, and 12 could be considered drought-tolerant genotypes that produced maximum grain yield and improved physiological characteristics under severe water stress conditions in hydroponic culture. In both studies, genotypes 3, 8, 13, and 20 performed poorly and were considered drought-sensitive genotypes with the lowest DTI values under water-stressed conditions. All the studied agronomic traits (grain yield, root and shoot length, shoot fresh and dry weights) and physiological traits (leaf phenolic, proline content, carotenoid, K+ accumulation, membrane stability index, and relative water content) were firmly inter-correlated and strongly correlated with DTI. They can be regarded as screening criteria, employing a large set of quinoa genotypes in a breeding program."
1,"Future ocean acidification mainly depends on the continuous ocean uptake of CO2 from the atmosphere. The trajectory of future atmospheric CO2 is prescribed in traditional climate projections with Earth system models, leading to a small model spread and apparently low uncertainties for projected acidification, but a large spread in global warming. However, climate policies such as the Paris Agreement define climate targets in terms of global warming levels and as traditional simulations do not converge to a given warming level, they cannot be used to assess uncertainties in projected acidification. Here, we perform climate simulations that converge to given temperature levels using the Adaptive Emission Reduction Algorithm (AERA) with the Earth system model Bern3D-LPX at different setups with different Transient Climate Response to cumulative carbon Emissions (TCRE) and choices between reductions in CO2 and non-CO2 forcing agents. With these simulations, we demonstrate that uncertainties in surface ocean acidification are an order of magnitude larger than the usually reported inter-model uncertainties from simulations with prescribed atmospheric CO2. Uncertainties in acidification at a given stabilized temperature are dominated by TCRE and the choice of emission reductions of non-CO2 greenhouse gases (GHGs). High TCRE and relatively low reductions of non-CO2 GHGs, for example, necessitate relatively strong reductions in CO2 emissions and lead to relatively little ocean acidification at a given temperature level. The results suggest that choices between reducing emissions of CO2 versus non-CO2 agents should consider the economic costs and ecosystem damage of ocean acidification."
1,"Marine calcifiers are considered to be among the most vulnerable taxa to climate-forced environmental changes occurring on continental margins with effects hypothesized to occur on microstructural, biomechanical, and geochemical properties of carbonate structures. Natural gradients in temperature, salinity, oxygen, and pH on an upwelling margin combined with the broad depth distribution (100-1,100 m) of the pink fragile sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus (formerly Allocentrotus) fragilis, along the southern California shelf and slope provide an ideal system to evaluate potential effects of multiple climate variables on carbonate structures in situ. We measured, for the first time, trait variability across four distinct depth zones using natural gradients as analogues for species-specific implications of oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) expansion, deoxygenation and ocean acidification. Although S. fragilis may likely be tolerant of future oxygen and pH decreases predicted during the twenty-first century, we determine from adults collected across multiple depth zones that urchin size and potential reproductive fitness (gonad index) are drastically reduced in the OMZ core (450-900 m) compared to adjacent zones. Increases in porosity and mean pore size coupled with decreases in mechanical nanohardness and stiffness of the calcitic endoskeleton in individuals collected from lower pH(Total) (7.57-7.59) and lower dissolved oxygen (13-42 mu mol kg(-1)) environments suggest that S. fragilis may be potentially vulnerable to crushing predators if these conditions become more widespread in the future. In addition, elemental composition indicates that S. fragilis has a skeleton composed of the low Mg-calcite mineral phase of calcium carbonate (mean Mg/Ca = 0.02 mol mol(-1)), with Mg/Ca values measured in the lower end of values reported for sea urchins known to date. Together these findings suggest that ongoing declines in oxygen and pH will likely affect the ecology and fitness of a dominant echinoid on the California margin."
1,"Climate change and loss of biodiversity are widely recognized as the foremost environmental challenges of our time. Forests annually sequester large quantities of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), and store carbon above and below ground for long periods of time. Intact forests-largely free from human intervention except primarily for trails and hazard removals-are the most carbon-dense and biodiverse terrestrial ecosystems, with additional benefits to society and the economy. Internationally, focus has been on preventing loss of tropical forests, yet U.S. temperate and boreal forests remove sufficient atmospheric CO2 to reduce national annual net emissions by 11%. U.S. forests have the potential for much more rapid atmospheric CO2 removal rates and biological carbon sequestration by intact and/or older forests. The recent 1.5 Degree Warming Report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change identifies reforestation and afforestation as important strategies to increase negative emissions, but they face significant challenges: afforestation requires an enormous amount of additional land, and neither strategy can remove sufficient carbon by growing young trees during the critical next decade(s). In contrast, growing existing forests intact to their ecological potential-termed proforestation-is a more effective, immediate, and low-cost approach that could be mobilized across suitable forests of all types. Proforestation serves the greatest public good by maximizing co-benefits such as nature-based biological carbon sequestration and unparalleled ecosystem services such as biodiversity enhancement, water and air quality, flood and erosion control, public health benefits, low impact recreation, and scenic beauty."
1,"It may be possible to sequester carbon in forests and forest products, but to date global trends in land management have resulted in a release of terrestrial carbon to the atmosphere. Over 100 PgC were released between 1850 and 1980, and during the 1980s global changes in land use (predominantly deforestation) caused a net release of 1.6 PgC yr(-1), about 25% of the total emissions of carbon dioxide from human activities and about 15% of the enhanced radiative forcing. Management practices that could change this release of terrestrial carbon to an accumulation include (i) a halt to deforestation; (ii) an expansion in the land area of forests; (iii) an increase in the stocks of carbon in existing forests; (iv) more efficient harvest and greater use of wood in long-lasting products; and (v) the substitution of wood fuels for fossil fuels. However, the rate of global warming needs management as well. Unless the warming is gradual enough to avoid widespread mortality of forests, the additional releases of carbon caused by the warming itself, through increased respiration, decay, and fires, may cancel the intended effects of forest management."
1,"Palythoa caribaeorum is a zoanthid often dominant in shallow rocky environments along the west coast of the Atlantic Ocean, from the tropics to the subtropics. This species has high environmental tolerance and is a good space competitor in reef environments. Considering current and future scenarios in the global climate regime, this study aimed to model and analyze the distribution of P. caribaeorum, generating maps of potential distribution for the present and the year 2100. The distribution was modeled using maximum entropy (Maxent) based on 327 occurrence sites retrieved from the literature. Calcite concentration, maximum chlorophyll-a concentration, salinity, pH, and temperature range yielded a model with the smallest Akaike information criterion (2649.8), and were used in the present and future distribution model. Data from the HadGEM2-ES climate model were used to generate the projections for the year 2100. The present distribution of P. caribaeorum shows that parts of the Brazilian coast, Caribbean Sea, and Florida are suitable regions for the species, as they are characterized by high salinity and pH and small temperature variation. An expansion of the species' distribution was forecast northward under mild climate scenarios, while a decrease of suitable areas was forecast in the south. In the climate scenario with the most intense changes, P. caribaeorum would lose one-half of its suitable habitats, including the northernmost and southernmost areas of its distribution. The Caribbean Sea and northeastern Brazil, as well as other places under the influence of coastal upwellings, may serve as potential havens for this species."
1,"Extreme hydrologic events are getting more frequent under a changing climate, and a reliable hydrological modeling framework is important to understand their mechanism. However, existing hydrological modeling frameworks are mostly constrained to a relatively coarse resolution, unrealistic input information, and insufficient evaluations, especially for the large domain, and they are, therefore, unable to address and reconstruct many of the water-related issues (e.g., flooding and drought). In this study, a 0.0625-degree (similar to 6 km) resolution variable infiltration capacity (VIC) model developed for China from 1970 to 2016 was extensively evaluated against remote sensing and ground-based observations. A unique feature in this modeling framework is the incorporation of new remotely sensed vegetation and soil parameter dataset. To our knowledge, this constitutes the first application of VIC with such a long-term and fine resolution over a large domain, and more importantly, with a holistic system-evaluation leveraging the best available earth data. The evaluations using in-situ observations of streamflow, evapotranspiration (ET), and soil moisture (SM) indicate a great improvement. The simulations are also consistent with satellite remote sensing products of ET and SM, because the mean differences between the VIC ET and the remote sensing ET range from -2 to 2 mm/day, and the differences for SM of the top thin layer range from -2 to 3 mm. Therefore, this continental-scale hydrological modeling framework is reliable and accurate, which can be used for various applications including extreme hydrological event detections."
1,"The harsh polar environment results in the dominance of mosses and liverworts in tundra communities. To date, very little research has been devoted to the diversity and ecology of these groups in the High Arctic. The aim of this research was to investigate the diversity and community composition of mosses and liverworts in various stages of the ecogenesis of Svalbard ecosystems, and to identify environmental factors affecting species distribution. In 2017, 270 plots were established in a grid in eight glacier forelands and the mature tundra surrounding them. Within these plots, the percentage cover of mosses and liverworts was investigated. In 201 plots, soil samples were taken and environmental data (aspect, bare ground cover, biological soil crust cover, distance from the glacier forehead, rock cover, slope, time elapsed since the glacier's retreat, Topographic Wetness Index, and total insolation) were obtained. In total, 105 species were recorded. Species number and composition depended on effects of both habitat type (foreland and mature tundra) and the geographical locations of glaciers, while species cover was also associated with the interaction between those factors. The following factors affected species distribution: cover of bare ground and vascular plants, distance from the glacier forehead, soil conductivity, contents of total organic carbon and total nitrogen in soil, K+ content, silt and sand contents, soil pH, time elapsed since the glacier's retreat, and total insolation. In the glacier forelands, mosses and liverworts are less exposed to competition from other species. Therefore, in the future, if global warming progresses at its current rate, forelands may serve as important species refugia."
1,"Increasing atmospheric CO2 is raising sea surface temperature (SST) and increasing seawater CO2 concentrations, resulting in a lower oceanic pH (ocean acidification; OA), which is expected to reduce the accretion of coral reef ecosystems. Although sediments comprise most of the calcium carbonate (CaCO3) within coral reefs, no in situ studies have looked at the combined effects of increased SST and OA on the dissolution of coral reef CaCO3 sediments. In situ benthic chamber incubations were used to measure dissolution rates in permeable CaCO3 sands under future OA and SST scenarios in a coral reef lagoon on Australia's Great Barrier Reef (Heron Island). End of century (2100) simulations (temperature +2.7 degrees C and pH -0.3) shifted carbonate sediments from net precipitating to net dissolving. Warming increased the rate of benthic respiration (R) by 29% per 1 degrees C and lowered the ratio of productivity to respiration (P/R; Delta P/R = -0.23), which increased the rate of CaCO3 sediment dissolution (average net increase of 18.9 mmol CaCO3 m(-2) d(-1) for business as usual scenarios). This is most likely due to the influence of warming on benthic P/R which, in turn, was an important control on sediment dissolution through the respiratory production of rho CO2. The effect of increasing CO2 on CaCO3 sediment dissolution (average net increase of 6.5 mmol CaCO3 m(-2) d(-1) for business as usual scenarios) was significantly less than the effect of warming. However, the combined effect of increasing both SST and rho CO2 on CaCO3 sediment dissolution was non-additive (average net increase of 5.6 mmol CaCO3 m(-2) d(-1)) due to the different responses of the benthic community. This study highlights that benthic biogeochemical processes, such as metabolism and associated CaCO3 sediment dissolution respond rapidly to changes in SST and OA, and that the response to multiple environmental changes are not necessarily additive."
1,"Elevated atmospheric [CO2] ('eCO(2)') may alter species composition within vegetation types by favouring the growth of some species over others. However, other related changes in climate conditions, such as increased frequency and severity of drought, may reduce eCO(2) fertilisation effects on plant growth. For many species, it is not known if responses will reflect variability in trait adaptations due to environment. We grew seedlings of nine species of eucalypts indicative of three regional vegetation types (representing a mesic-xeric ecosystem gradient) under two CO2 concentrations (400 parts per million; 640 ppm, i.e. eCO(2)) and two watering regimes (well-watered; drought-like conditions). Elevated CO2 increased biomass accumulation but drought reduced this effect, with mesic species experiencing larger relative reductions. Elevated CO2 increased the size of storage organs used during resprouting, in the absence of drought. Typical drought responses, such as increased leaf mass per unit area and root mass ratio, were more pronounced in xeric species and were reduced under eCO(2). Seedling growth and resprouting may be enhanced by eCO(2), suggesting continued dominance of resprouting species in disturbance-prone ecosystems, although severe drought is likely to offset eCO(2) fertilisation. Xeric species may cope with drought more effectively under eCO(2) than mesic species due to resource acquisition and storage traits that are more responsive.

1,"Mangroves are among the world's most threatened ecosystems. Understanding how these ecosystems responded to past natural and anthropogenic drivers of ecological change is essential not only for understanding how extant mangroves have been shaped but also for informing their conservation. This paper reviews the available paleoecological evidence for Pleistocene and Holocene responses of Caribbean mangroves to climatic, eustatic, and anthropogenic drivers. The first records date from the Last Interglacial, when global average temperatures and sea levels were slightly higher than present and mangroves grew in locations and conditions similar to today. During the Last Glaciation, temperatures and sea levels were significantly lower, and Caribbean mangroves grew far from their present locations on presently submerged sites. The current mangrove configuration was progressively attained after Early Holocene warming and sea level rise in the absence of anthropogenic pressure. Human influence began to be important in the Mid-Late Holocene, especially during the Archaic and Ceramic cultural periods, when sea levels were close to their present position and climatic and human drivers were the most influential factors. During the last millennium, the most relevant drivers of ecological change have been the episodic droughts linked to the Little Ice Age and the historical developments of the last centuries."
1,"Groundwater-the world's largest freshwater resource-is critically important for irrigated agriculture and hence for global food security. Yet depletion is widespread in large groundwater systems in both semi-arid and humid regions of the world. Excessive extraction for irrigation where groundwater is slowly renewed is the main cause of the depletion, and climate change has the potential to exacerbate the problem in some regions. Globally aggregated groundwater depletion contributes to sea-level rise, and has accelerated markedly since the mid-twentieth century. But its impacts on water resources are more obvious at the regional scale, for example in agriculturally important parts of India, China and the United States. Food production in such regions can only be made sustainable in the long term if groundwater levels are stabilized. To this end, a transformation is required in how we value, manage and characterize groundwater systems. Technical approaches-such as water diversion, artificial groundwater recharge and efficient irrigation-have failed to balance regional groundwater budgets. They need to be complemented by more comprehensive strategies that are adapted to the specific social, economic, political and environmental settings of each region."
1,"Global warming is likely to profoundly influence future weather patterns, and one consequence of this is the likelihood of an increase in tropical cyclone intensity. The present paper presents a cost-benefit analysis of introducing significant amounts of green energy in the electricity system in Japan in the light of the economic damage that an increase in tropical cyclone intensity could have on GDP growth between 2010 and 2085. Essentially the passage of a tropical cyclone will result not only in physical damage but also on a decrease in economic productivity due to precautionary cessation of the economic activity, which has an effect on GDP growth. By comparing the economic performance of different electricity system scenarios with the indirect economic damage of tropical cyclones from 2010 to 2085, based on the yearly economic data of green electricity, fossil fuel, GDP and population, it can be seen that the green scenarios are generally a cost-effective way of mitigating the effects of these weather systems, despite the large amount of initial investments necessary.

1,"The last years, Central European forests have suffered from drought as a direct consequence of climate change. All these forests have a long management history and it lies in the landowner's responsibility to replant damaged forests. Hence, landowners and the government are searching currently for species suitable to replant in areas affected by tree die-offs. It is a matter of fact that good knowledge of drought resistance of species is a critical measure for the current replanting efforts. We determined a widely recognized trait for leaf drought tolerance (leaf water potential at turgor loss point at full hydration, pi(tlp)) in 41 woody species native or introduced in Central Europe. The osmometric rapid assessment method was used to measure the leaf osmotic potential at full hydration (pi(osm)) of sun-exposed leaves and converted to pi(tlp). Mean pi(tlp) of the native species was 2.33 +/- 0.33 MPa. The less negative pi(tlp) was found in the introduced species Aesculus hypocastania and was at -1.70 +/- 0.11 MPa. The most negative pi(tlp), and thus the potentially highest drought tolerance, were found in the introduced species Pseudotsuga menzesii and was at -3.02 +/- 0.14 MPa. High or less negative pi(tlp) is associated with lower drought tolerance, whereas low or more negative pi(tlp) stands for higher resistance to drought stress. For example, the two native species Illex aquifolium and Alnus glustinosa are species naturally associated with moist habitats and are characterized by the least negative pi(tlp) of -1.75 +/- 0.02 and -1.76 +/- 0.03 MPa, respectively."
1,"Wetlands are among the most vulnerable and dynamic ecosystems of the world. Any change in the anthropogenic footprint or climate affects the health of these pristine ecologically and socioeconomically important ecosystems. In the present study, land use land cover changes (LULCC) and fragmentation of natural landscape changes in an urban wetland, Khushalsar, located in the heart of the Srinagar City, were assessed using high-resolution satellite data, geospatial modeling approach, and ground observations over the last similar to 5 decades (1965 and 2018). The spatiotemporal changes in LULC of the wetland were assessed for 3 time periods that include 1965-1980, 1980-2018, and 1965-2018. Additionally, landscape fragmentation tool (LFT) was used to quantify fragmentation of land cover. The analysis of LULCC indicated that built-up areas in the vicinity of the wetland increased by 510% between 1965 and 2018. The aquatic vegetation and marshy lands increased by 150% and 33% respectively. The area under agriculture, plantation, open water, and barren lands decreased mostly taken over by built-up areas. Within the wetland, the area under open water spread reduced by 75% while the aquatic vegetation increased by 150% from 1965 to 2018. The built-up areas including roads also showed a substantial increase. The LFT analysis revealed four categories of landscapes i.e., patch, edge, perforated, and core areas. Since the natural land cover types were taken over by land use predominantly built-up areas, the core natural areas and perforated landscapes in the Khushalsar shrunk by 34% and 94% respectively indicating fragmentation of natural environment. The lack of sewage treatment facility, reckless unplanned urbanization within and in the vicinity of the wetland, is responsible for the degradation of the Khushalsar wetland."
0,"The multi-level and multi-actor character of the international climate governance regime, as well as the imminent need for action to combat climate change, stimulates the introduction of new and innovative cross-sectoral policy proposals by policy entrepreneurs. To date, academic literature has extensively studied and discussed the importance of policy entrepreneurs for agenda-setting. The role of policy entrepreneurs in providing continuous support for a new climate policy resulting in its implementation, has on the other hand, so far received only little attention. Taking the Norwegian Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation commitment as an exemplary case, this paper explores the potential of entrepreneurial engagement throughout a country's climate policy-making process. It aims to demonstrate the importance of policy entrepreneurs beyond agenda-setting, namely for the policy formulation phase in which responsibilities for the implementation are designated to governmental bodies. We refer to this step as institutional anchoring. Following an explorative approach, this paper shows that different types of actors - non-governmental organisations and governmental actors act as policy entrepreneurs. It demonstrates the roles and importance of policy entrepreneurs for not only gaining, but also maintaining attention on a new policy by means of coalition building and framing."
1,"The Denitrification-Decomposition (DNDC) model was used to elucidate the role of climate, soil properties, and farming practices in determining spatial and temporal variations in the production and emission of nitrous oxide (N2O) from agriculture in the United States. Sensitivity studies documented possible causes of annual variability in N2O flux for a simulated Iowa corn-growing soil. The 37 scenarios tested indicated that soil tillage and nitrate pollution in rainfall may be especially significant anthropogenic factors which have increased N2O emissions from soils in the United States. Feedbacks to climate change and biogeochemical manipulation of agricultural soil reflect complex interactions between the nitrogen and carbon cycles. A 20% increase in annual average temperature in degrees C produced a 33% increase in N2O emissions. Manure applications to Iowa corn crops enhanced carbon storage in soils, but also increased N2O emissions. A DNDC simulation of annual N2O emissions from all crop and pasture lands in the United States indicated that the value lies in the range 0.9 - 1.2 TgN. Soil tillage and fertilizer use were the most important farming practices contributing to enhanced N2O emissions at the national scale. Soil organic matter and climate variables were the primary determinants of spatial variability in N2O emissions. Our results suggest that the United States Government, and possibly the Intergovernmental Panel on Climatic Change (IPCC), have underestimated the importance of agriculture as a national and global source of atmospheric N2O. The coupled nature of the nitrogen and carbon cycles in soils results in complex feedbacks which complicate the formulation of strategies to reduce the global warming potential of greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture."
1,"Mangroves are found throughout the tropics, providing critical ecosystem goods and services to coastal communities and supporting rich biodiversity. Despite their value, world-wide, mangroves are being rapidly degraded and deforested. Madagascar contains approximately 2% of the world's mangroves, >20% of which has been deforested since 1990 from increased extraction for charcoal and timber and conversion to small to large-scale agriculture and aquaculture. Loss is particularly prominent in the northwestern Ambaro and Ambanja bays. Here, we focus on Ambaro and Ambanja bays, presenting dynamics calculated using United States Geological Survey (USGS) national-level mangrove maps and the first localized satellite imagery derived map of dominant land-cover types. The analysis of USGS data indicated a loss of 7659 ha (23.7%) and a gain of 995 ha (3.1%) from 1990-2010. Contemporary mapping results were 93.4% accurate overall (Kappa 0.9), with producer's and user's accuracies >= 85%. Classification results allowed partitioning mangroves in to ecologically meaningful, spectrally distinct strata, wherein field measurements facilitated estimating the first total carbon stocks for mangroves in Madagascar. Estimates suggest that higher stature closed-canopy mangroves have average total vegetation carbon values of 146.8 Mg/ha (+/- 10.2) and soil organic carbon of 446.2 (+/- 36.9), supporting a growing body of studies that mangroves are amongst the most carbon-dense tropical forests."
1,"Climate change and sustainability are not discipline-specific issues. As the central science, however, chemistry offers students in non-science-major chemistry and society courses a unique opportunity to explore these global issues in an appropriately global context. We journey around planet Earth, stopping at specific locations to explore fundamental topics from the natural sciences. Our journey investigates species extinction in the cloud forests of Costa Rica, receding alpine glaciers in New Zealand and Switzerland, carbon dioxide spewing from the smokestacks of industrial China, terrestrial carbon trapped in the frozen Arctic tundra, polarized ideologies in the committee rooms of Washington DC, and more. At each location, we connect the science with significant social, political, ethical, and economic issues in that region. Our global analysis incorporates interviews with scientists, policy makers, community leaders, and others as we weave scientific climate-change principles within the contextual framework of social issues and ecosystems. This global analysis allows each student to personally assess the momentous challenge and urgency of addressing climate change, as well as the stewardship required of us-the planet's trustees-to provide a habitable world for future generations."
1,"The paradigm that climate change will alter global marine biodiversity is one of the most widely accepted. Yet, its predictions remain difficult to test because laboratory systems are inadequate at incorporating ecological complexity, and common biodiversity metrics have varying sensitivity to detect change. Here, we test for the prevalence of global responses in biodiversity and community-level change to future climate (acidification and warming) from studies at volcanic CO2 vents across four major global coastal ecosystems and studies in laboratory mesocosms. We detected globally replicable patterns of species replacements and community reshuffling under ocean acidification in major natural ecosystems, yet species diversity and other common biodiversity metrics were often insensitive to detect such community change, even under significant habitat loss. Where there was a lack of consistent patterns of biodiversity change, these were a function of similar numbers of studies observing negative versus positive species responses to climate stress. Laboratory studies showed weaker sensitivity to detect species replacements and community reshuffling in general. We conclude that common biodiversity metrics can be insensitive in revealing the anticipated effects of climate stress on biodiversity-even under significant biogenic habitat loss-and can mask widespread reshuffling of ecological communities in a future ocean. Although the influence of ocean acidification on community restructuring can be less evident than species loss, such changes can drive the dynamics of ecosystem stability or their functional change. Importantly, species identity matters, representing a substantial influence of future oceans."
1,"With an approach combining crop modelling and biotechnology to assess the performance of three durum wheat cultivars (Creso, Duilio, Simeto) in a climate change context, weather and agronomic datasets over the period 1973-2004 from two sites, Benatzu and Ussana (Southern Sardinia, Itay), were used and the model responses were interpreted considering the role of DREB genes in the genotype performance with a focus on drought conditions. The CERES-Wheat crop model was calibrated and validated for grain yield, earliness and kernel weight. Forty-eight synthetic scenarios were used: 6 scenarios with increasing maximum air temperature; 6 scenarios with decreasing rainfall; 36 scenarios combining increasing temperature and decreasing rainfall. The simulated effects on yields, anthesis and kernel weights resulted in yield reduction, increasing kernel weight, and shortened growth duration in both sites. Creso (late cultivar) was the most sensitive to simulated climate conditions. Simeto and Duilio (early cultivars) showed lower simulated yield reductions and a larger anticipation of anthesis date. Observed data showed the same responses for the three cultivars in both sites. The CERES-Wheat model proved to be effective in representing reality and can be used in crop breeding programs with a molecular approach aiming at developing molecular markers for the resistance to drought stress."
1,"Desertification (representing soil degradation) is one of the three nature-induced (climate change, hydrological cycle) and of three primarily human-induced challenges (population growth, urbanisation and food) of global environmental change. These six components closely interact and contribute to fatal outcomes: primarily to extreme weather events and hydro-meteorological disasters (drought, flash floods, storms) and envirorimentally-induced migrations. These two fatal outcomes may have - in some cases societal repercussions that may trigger or contribute to domestic, regional and international crisis and conflicts and thus they may become an issue of both human, societal, national and international security. To illustrate the causal linkages: for example in Morocco in the 1980s and 1990s, the following chain of events could be observed: severe drought, increase in food prices, hunger riots, general strikes, the police and armed forces interfered to repress these violent upheavals and subsequently hundreds of casualties could be deplored. These cases were not listed as a conflict in the relevant conflict data bases. The paper is organised in three parts: In the first part, the complex casual interactions among six factors of global environment change, two fatal outcomes and three societal repercussions: crises, conflicts and conflict avoidance, prevention and resolution will be discussed. In the second part, different security concepts will be reviewed that may be of relevance for dealing with desertification as a security issue. In the third part, possible security relevance pro-active political strategies will be considered, to avoid, and prevent that desertification issues can pose security challenges, and to contribute to a resolution of the desertification driven violence."
1,"1 Insect pests, biological invasions and climate change are considered to represent major threats to biodiversity, ecosystem functioning, agriculture and forestry. Deriving hypothesis of contemporary and/or future potential distributions of insect pests and invasive species is becoming an important tool for predicting the spatial structure of potential threats. 2 The western corn rootworm (WCR) Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte is a pest of maize in North America that has invaded Europe in recent years, resulting in economic costs in terms of maize yields in both continents. The present study aimed to estimate the dynamics of potential areas of invasion by the WCR under a climate change scenario in the Northern Hemisphere. The areas at risk under this scenario were assessed by comparing, using complementary approaches, the spatial projections of current and future areas of climatic favourability of the WCR. Spatial hypothesis were generated with respect to the presence records in the native range of the WCR and physiological thresholds from previous empirical studies. 3 We used a previously developed protocol specifically designed to estimate the climatic favourability of the WCR. We selected the most biologically relevant climatic predictors and then used multidimensional envelope (MDE) and Mahalanobis distances (MD) approaches to derive potential distributions for current and future climatic conditions. 4 The results obtained showed a northward advancement of the upper physiological limit as a result of climate change, which might increase the strength of outbreaks at higher latitudes. In addition, both MDE and MD outputs predict the stability of climatic favourability for the WCR in the core of the already invaded area in Europe, which suggests that this zone would continue to experience damage from this pest in Europe."
1,"Natural hazards are naturally occurring physical events that can impact human welfare both directly and indirectly, via shocks to ecosystems and the services they provide. Animal-mediated pollination is critical for sustaining agricultural economies and biodiversity, yet stands to lose both from present exposure to natural hazards, and future climate-driven shifts in their distribution, frequency, and intensity. In contrast to the depth of knowledge available for anthropogenic-related threats, our understanding of how naturally occurring extreme events impact pollinators and pollination has not yet been synthesized. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the potential impacts of natural hazards on pollinators and pollination in natural and cultivated systems. From a total of 117 studies (74% of which were observational), we found evidence of community and population-level impacts to plants and pollinators from seven hazard types, including climatological (extreme heat, fire, drought), hydrological (flooding), meteorological (hurricanes), and geophysical (volcanic activity, tsunamis). Plant and pollinator response depended on the type of natural hazard and level of biological organization observed; 19% of cases reported no significant impact, whereas the majority of hazards held consistent negative impacts. However, the effects of fire were mixed, but taxa specific; meta-analysis revealed that bee abundance and species richness tended to increase in response to fire, differing significantly from the mainly negative response of Lepidoptera. Building from this synthesis, we highlight important future directions for pollination-focused natural hazard research, including the need to: (a) advance climate change research beyond static mean-level changes by better incorporating shock events; (b) identify impacts at higher levels of organization, including ecological networks and co-evolutionary history; and (c) address the notable gap in crop pollination services research-particularly in developing regions of the world. We conclude by discussing implications for safeguarding pollination services in the face of global climate change."
1,"Biodiversity is globally under pressure, and the current decline in insect biomass and diversity is likely caused by human activities. Key drivers of biodiversity loss include agricultural intensification and anthropogenic climate change. Nevertheless, a thorough understanding of potential interactions between both factors and the mechanisms underlying insect declines, in general, is still lacking.Here, the authors investigate the combined effects of nitrogen fertilisation and drought, as applied to host plants, on the preference and performance of the butterfly Lycaena tityrus.Individuals performed best on plants having received medium nitrogen levels, while performance was reduced by either a lack of or strong fertilisation, the former potentially caused by nitrogen limitation and the latter by increased concentrations of toxic allelochemicals. Female oviposition preference though was positively related to nitrogen fertilisation, resulting in a mismatch between preference and offspring performance at high nitrogen levels. Plant drought stress additionally reduced herbivore performance, and females appeared to suffer more from low-quality food than males.Our results indicate that increasing nitrogen fertilisation, as applied in intensive agriculture, may substantially reduce host-plant quality for insect herbivores, which may be exaggerated in the course of climate change due to the more frequent occurrence of droughts. Our study thus contributes to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying human-driven insect declines in agricultural landscapes and beyond."
1,"Whether species can respond evolutionarily to current climate change is crucial for the persistence of many species. Yet, very few studies have examined genetic responses to climate change in manipulated experiments carried out in natural field conditions. We examined the evolutionary response to climate change in a common annelid worm using a controlled replicated experiment where climatic conditions were manipulated in a natural setting. Analyzing the transcribed genome of 15 local populations, we found that about 12% of the genetic polymorphisms exhibit differences in allele frequencies associated to changes in soil temperature and soil moisture. This shows an evolutionary response to realistic climate change happening over short-time scale, and calls for incorporating evolution into models predicting future response of species to climate change. It also shows that designed climate change experiments coupled with genome sequencing offer great potential to test for the occurrence (or lack) of an evolutionary response."
1,"The study aimed to find the significant relations between the dominant plant species of secondary succession of lasting abandonment of agricultural fields on sandy soil in central Poland, and soil water repellency strength. The critical soil moisture content for hydrophobicity for individual sites ranged from 10.7 to 16.7%, and the differences were not statistically significant. After periods of prolonged drought, all abandonment agriculture fields indicated lower soil moisture content than critical threshold (10.7-16.7%) for soil water repellency. The soil water repellency was assessed as extreme class based on Water Drop Penetration Time (WDPT) test. The relationship between the main dominant species cover and WDPT test was diverse, with Agrostis gigantea agg. and Avena sativa as a species reaching highest cover within low values of WDPT. Inexpertly Betula pendula agg. (unexpectely) and Pinus sylvestris dominated sites with the highest values of WDPT test. The conducted research indicates that due to climate change, leaving sandy soils in warm temperate climate without an alternative management plan may pose a significant environmental risk."
1,"Previous research indicates that some important cocoa cultivated areas in West Africa will become unsuitable for growing cocoa in the next decades. However, it is not clear if this change will be mirrored by the shade tree species that could be used in cocoa-based agroforestry systems (C-AFS). We characterized current and future patterns of habitat suitability for 38 tree species (including cocoa), using a consensus method for species distribution modelling considering for the first time climatic and soil variables. The models projected an increase of up to 6% of the potential suitable area for cocoa by 2060 compared to its current suitable area in West Africa. Furthermore, the suitable area was highly reduced (14.5%) once considering only available land-use not contributing to deforestation. Regarding shade trees, 50% of the 37 shade tree species modelled will experience a decrease in geographic rate extent by 2040 in West Africa, and 60% by 2060. Hotspots of shade tree species richness overlap the current core cocoa production areas in Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire, suggesting a potential mismatch for the outer areas in West Africa. Our results highlight the importance of transforming cocoa-based agroforestry systems by changing shade tree species composition to adapt this production systems for future climate conditions."
1,"Climate change is globally recognized as one of the key drivers of degradation of coastal wetland ecosystems, causing considerable alteration of services provided by these habitats. Quantifying the physical impacts of climate change on these services is therefore of utmost importance. Yet, practical work in this field is fragmented and scarce in current literature, especially in developing countries which are likely to suffer most from the adverse climate change impacts. Using a coherent scenario-based approach that combines assessment of physical impacts with economic valuation techniques, here we quantify potential climate change driven losses in the value of wetland ecosystems services due to relative, sea-level rise (RSLR)-induced inundation in the vulnerable Western coastal area of Bangladesh in 2100. The results show a small inundation area in 2100 under the three IPCC climate scenarios of RCP2.6 (with 0.25 m of RSLR), RCP6.0 (with 1.18 m of RSLR), and RCP8.5 (with 1.77 m of RSLR) for the coastal wetland ecosystems including the Sundarbans mangrove forest, neritic system and aquaculture ponds. In all scenarios, RSLR will drive a loss in the total value of ecosystem services such as provision of raw materials, and food provision, ranging from US$ 0-1 million to US$ 16.5-20 million, respectively. The outcomes of this study reveal that RSLR-induced inundation on its own, is unlikely to be a major threat to the wetland ecosystems in Western coast of Bangladesh. This would suggest that other climate change impacts such as coastal erosion, increase in frequency of cyclone events, and sea temperature rise might be the likely primary drivers of change in the value of wetland ecosystems services in this area."

1,"Global warming has become a critical environmental, social, and economic threat, with increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. This study aims to analyse temperature trends and climate indices in the Po Valley, a significant economic and agricultural region in Italy, by examining data from two historical stations: the urban Modena Observatory and the rural Mount Cimone Observatory. The analysis extends previous studies to 2018, assessing the magnitude of climate changes since the 1950s and isolating the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect in Modena. Significant warming trends were confirmed at both sites, with in maximum (TX) and minimum (TN) temperatures trends nearly doubling from 1981 to 2018 compared to 1951-2018. For example, TX trends reached 0.84 degrees Cdecade-1 in Modena and 0.62 degrees Cdecade-1 at Mount Cimone, while TN trends were 0.77 and 0.80 degrees Cdecade-1, respectively. Extreme climate indices showed a substantial increase in warm days and nights (TX90p and TN90p, respectively). Particularly we found TX90p of 27.5 daysdecade-1 in Modena and 15 daysdecade-1 at Mount Cimone while TN90p of 29.5 daysdecade-1 in Modena, 22 daysdecade-1 at Mount Cimone. The UHI effect significantly impacts Modena's temperature trends. Urbanization contributes up to 65% of the rise in warm nights. Specifically, frost days decreased by 1.88 daysdecade-1 (37% of Urban Contribute, UC), tropical nights increased by 5.16 daysdecade-1 (57% UC), warm nights increased by 12.7 daysdecade-1 (65% UC), and cool nights decreased by 3.19 daysdecade-1 (39% UC). Overall, the study underscores the importance of considering both global and local factors in regional climate trend analysis. This paper deals with temperature trend analysis and comparison between an urban and a mountain meteorological station in the Po Valley, Italy. Results show a notable warming trend for the period 1981-2018 with a not negligible contribution of the Urban Heat Island phenomenon. image"
1,"The extinction of species across the globe is accelerating, directly or indirectly due to human activities. Biological impoverishment, habitat fragmentation, climate change, increasing toxification, and the rapid global movement of people and other living organisms have worked synergistically to diminish ecosystem function. This has resulted in unprecedented levels of disease emergence, driven by human-induced environmental degradation, which poses a threat to the survival and health of biodiversity. The emerging discipline of conservation medicine addresses these concerns through the following entities: humans; global climate; habitat destruction and alteration; biodiversity, including wildlife populations; domestic animals; and pathogens, parasites and pollutants. Furthermore, conservation medicine focuses on explicit linkages between these entities. As a crisis discipline, the usefulness of conservation medicine ultimately will depend on its applicability to solving problems. The perspectives and scientific findings of conservation medicine provide input into biomedical education; and policy and management of ecosystems, habitats and imperiled species. A sentinel species is one that has presented itself, or has been selected, to provide insight into the state (health) of an ecosystem, based on user-defined (e. g., researchers, conservationists or policymakers) objectives (e. g., disease, parasites, toxics, climate change, habitat destruction), coupled with the utility and vulnerability of this species to the perceived stress. The scientific information generated by the sentinel species should empower stakeholders and decision-makers to take mitigative action or support predictive capabilities; the utility of the species selected should consider its value and relevance to conservationists and to society at large (e. g., education and outreach; social sciences). Wild canids may serve as excellent sentinel species of emerging canine vector-borne diseases. Several canine vector-borne diseases or antibodies to these pathogens have been identified in wild canids including visceral leishmaniosis, Lyme disease, heartworm, hepatozoonosis and anaplasmosis to name a few. These reports are relatively recent as they relate to wildlife-domestic animal interactions, globalisation, translocations, habitat fragmentation and climate change. These pathogens and their relationship to wild canids are described herein. Further research needs to be performed to elucidate the role of the 36 extant species of wild canids in the epidemiology of canine vector-borne diseases."
0,"Species Distribution Models (SDMs) constitute an important tool to assist decision-making in environmental conservation and planning. A popular application of these models is the projection of species distributions under climate change conditions. Yet there are still a range of methodological SDM factors which limit the transferability of these models, contributing significantly to the overall uncertainty of the resulting projections. An important source of uncertainty often neglected in climate change studies comes from the use of background data (a.k.a. pseudo-absences) for model calibration. Here, we study the sensitivity to pseudo-absence sampling as a determinant factor for SDM stability and transferability under climate change conditions, focusing on European wide projections of Quercus robur as an illustrative case study. We explore the uncertainty in future projections derived from ten pseudo-absence realizations and three popular SDMs (GLM, Random Forest and MARS). The contribution of the pseudo-absence realization to the uncertainty was higher in peripheral regions and clearly differed among the tested SDMs in the whole study domain, being MARS the most sensitive with projections differing up to a 40% for different realizations and GLM the most stable. As a result we conclude that parsimonious SDMs are preferable in this context, avoiding complex methods (such as MARS) which may exhibit poor model transferability. Accounting for this new source of SDM-dependent uncertainty is crucial when forming multi-model ensembles to undertake climate change projections."
1,"Large-scale plantations were established under the Grain for Green project to improve the ecological environment of the Loess Plateau (LP) of China. However, there are increasing concerns regarding the sustainability of plantation ecosystems under climate change. In this study, we developed tree-ring width chronologies of Pinus tabulaeformis at seven sites along a precipitation gradient from south to north in the LP. Correlation analysis was performed to investigate the climate (temperature, precipitation, self-calibrating Palmer Drought Severity Index)-growth relationship. Moreover, the tree resilience components were computed to study the adaptability of trees to extreme drought during the growth periods. The results showed that the differences in radial growth to climate change along the precipitation gradient and the cluster analysis of the tree ring width index (RWI)-scPDSI correlation coefficient illustrated that the climate-growth response pattern along the LP was divided into southern and northern regions. Tree growth in the southern region is limited by humid environment conditions, while tree growth in the early and middle growing seasons of the northern region is limited by warming-induced drought. As the temperature rising over the past fifty years, the growth was found to be negatively correlated with temperature, especially in the spring and autumn seasons of the northern region. In contrast, the effect of precipitation on tree growth became more negative in the southern region, but more positive in the middle and late growing seasons of the northern region. Moreover, tree resilience analysis showed that the high resistance of Pinus tabulaeformis in the southern region, whereas high recovery in the northern region. It was difficult for the growth of Pinus tabulaeformis to recover from drought in the southern region, but stronger adaptability to extreme drought events in the northern region. Our study illustrated that there are different climate response patterns and limiting factors of Pinus tabulaeformis along the precipitation gradient in the LP; thus, different ecological restoration and regional forestry management strategies should be initiated in the LP."
1,"Ocean acidification (OA) driven by sea water uptake of anthropogenic atmospheric CO2 has broad deleterious effects on marine species including modified behavioural interactions such as between predators and prey. Predatory sea stars are key species in many marine ecosystems and often elicit defensive responses in their prey. This study investigated the effect of elevated CO2 on the escape response of the sea star Parvulastra exigua to its sea star predator Meridiastra calcar. In response to touch by M. calcar, P. exigua exhibits a distinct fleeing response. The escape response of P. exigua with respect to velocity and escape trajectory was investigated after both species were acclimated in OA conditions. At pH(T) 7.6 and 7.8 velocity and escape trajectory of the fleeing response of P. exigua did not differ from that seen in the ambient treatment. However, there was a delay in the time that P. exigua started to flee with the initiation time being 2.8 times slower (10 vs 28 s) at pH(T) 7.6. This delay may increase the vulnerability of P. exigua to predation by M. calcar and have ecological effects with respect to the role of this species as an algal grazer on rocky shores of southeast Australia where these sea star species co-occur."
1,"AimsIn subalpine grasslands, litter decomposition controls soil nutrient availability and is highly sensitive to increasing intensity and frequency of extreme climate events, potentially impacting grasslands diversity and functioning. Here, we assessed the effects of early snowmelt and summer drought on decomposition, and how these were modulated by agricultural management.MethodsIn a common garden, conservative and exploitative assembled communities were submitted for two years to combined snow removal and drought, and to cutting and fertilization. We measured decomposition rates of standard and native leaf material from each plant communities on their respective soils.ResultsWe observed relatively weak climatic stress effects on decomposition rates. Management increased decomposition rates and remaining litter N contents through leaf quality improvement rather than changed soil biotic activity. Climate events impacted the decomposer community and limited litter N immobilization in conservative communities. Less recalcitrant litter of exploitative species facilitated decomposition and counterbalanced the negative effects of climate stress.ConclusionOur results suggest that drought and earlier snowmelt could decrease N availability in subalpine grasslands due to reduced litter biomass and decomposition. In the long-term climate change may shift subalpine grasslands towards more conservative plant composition and lower soil fertility."
1,"The Lancang-Mekong River (LMR) is an important transboundary river that originates from the Qinghai- Tibet Plateau, China and flows through six nations before draining into the South China Sea. Knowledge about the past and future changes in climate and water for this basin is critical in order to support regio-nal sustainable development. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the scientific progress that has been made in understanding the changing climate and water systems, and discusses outstanding challenges and future research opportunities. The existing literature suggests that: pt The warming rate in the Lancang-Mekong River Basin (LMRB) is higher than the mean global warming rate, and it is higher in its upper portion, the Lancang River Basin (LRB), than in its lower portion, the Mekong River Basin (MRB); (R) historical precipitation has increased over the LMRB, particularly from 1981 to 2010, as the wet season became wetter in the entire basin, while the dry season became wetter in the LRB but drier in the MRB; (R) in the past, streamflow increased in the LRB but slightly decreased in the MRB, and increases in streamflow are projected for the future in the LMRB; and (R) historical streamflow increased in the dry season but decreased in the wet season from 1960 to 2010, while a slight increase is projected during the wet season. Four research directions are identified as follows: pt investigation of the impacts of dams on river flow and local communities; (R) implementation of a novel water-energy-food-ecology (WEFE) nexus; (R) integration of groundwater and human health management with water resource assessment and management; and (R) strengthening of transboundary collaboration in order to address sustainable development goals (SDGs).(c) 2021 THE AUTHORS.

1,"Background: Though there was the significant decrease in the incidence of malaria in central and southwest China during the 1980s and 1990s, there has been a re-emergence of malaria since 2000. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted amongst the staff of eleven Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in China to gauge their perceptions regarding the impacts of climate change on malaria transmission and its control and prevention. Descriptive analysis was performed to study CDC staff's knowledge, attitudes, perceptions and suggestions for malaria control in the face of climate change. Results: A majority (79.8%) of CDC staff were concerned about climate change and 79.7% believed the weather was becoming warmer. Most participants (90.3%) indicated climate change had a negative effect on population health, 92.6 and 86.8% considered that increasing temperatures and precipitation would influence the transmission of vector-borne diseases including malaria. About half (50.9%) of the surveyed staff indicated malaria had re-emerged in recent years, and some outbreaks were occurring in new geographic areas. The main reasons for such re-emergence were perceived to be: mosquitoes in high-density, numerous imported cases, climate change, poor environmental conditions, internal migrant populations, and lack of health awareness. Conclusions: This study found most CDC staff endorsed the statement that climate change had a negative impact on infectious disease transmission. Malaria had re-emerged in some areas of China, and most of the staff believed that this can be managed. However, high densities of mosquitoes and the continuous increase in imported cases of malaria in local areas, together with environmental changes are bringing about critical challenges to malaria control in China. This study contributes to an understanding of climate change related perceptions of malaria control and prevention amongst CDC staff. It may help to formulate in-house training guidelines, community health promotion programmes and policies to improve the capacity of malaria control and prevention in the face of climate change in China."
1,"Low-lying atoll reef islands host populations who are highly exposed to increasing ocean-related pressures resulting from accelerated sea-level rise, ocean warming and acidification. Since 2010, changes in the position of atoll reef island shoreline were estimated on more than 400 Pacific islands using multi-date image analysis. These studies have emphasized island persistence and highlighted the major role of local controls, i.e., human activities and tropical cyclones, in shoreline change. However, they provide limited knowledge on the ecological-morphological linkages driving island change. In order to contribute filling this gap, will be studied the statistical relationships between multidecadal shoreline change and high-resolution outer slope morphometry of the eastern windward coast of Takapoto Atoll (Tuamotu Archipelago, French Polynesia). Shoreline change was estimated using 1969 airborne and 2013 spacebome imagery, while outer slope morphometry was mapped at 2 m spatial resolution using 2016 spacebome imagery. Nine classes of shoreline changes (N=1 402), ranging from >50 m accretion to >50 m erosion, were compared with averages of depth and slope metrics, derived from satellite-based bathymetry mapping. A strong positive correlation between shoreline erosion versus (i) depth and (ii) slope averages was obtained (R-2=0.93 and R-2=0.96, respectively): the deeper/steeper outer transects are, the more eroded shoreline transects are. Those findings suitably match the theory of wave propagation in shallow/gentle waters describing an increase in cross-shore sediment transfer with shallowness, thus explaining spatial variations in shoreline response. The implications of those original results for reef islands' future under climate change will be discussed."
1,"Drought stress, which causes a decline in quality and quantity of crop yields, has become more accentuated these days due to climatic change. Serious measures need to be taken to increase the tolerance of crop plants to acute drought conditions likely to occur due to global warming. Drought stress causes many physiological and biochemical changes in plants, rendering the maintenance of osmotic adjustment highly crucial. The degree of plant resistance to drought varies with plant species and cultivars, phenological stages of the plant, and the duration of plant exposure to the stress. Osmoregulation in plants under low water potential relies on synthesis and accumulation of osmoprotectants or osmolytes such as soluble proteins, sugars, and sugar alcohols, quaternary ammonium compounds, and amino acids, like proline. This review highlights the role of osmolytes in water-stressed plants and of enzymes entailed in their metabolism. It will be useful, especially for researchers working on the development of drought-resistant crops by using the metabolic-engineering techniques."
1,"Abiotic stresses like drought and salinity are major factors resulting in crop yield losses and soil degradation worldwide. To meet increasing food demands, we must improve crop productivity, especially under increasing abiotic stresses due to climate change. Recent studies suggest that seaweed-based biostimulants could be a solution to this problem. Here, we summarize the current findings of using these biostimulants and highlight current knowledge gaps. Seaweed extracts were shown to enhance nutrient uptake and improve growth performance in crops under stressed and normal conditions. Seaweed extracts contain several active compounds, for example, polysaccharides, polyphenols and phytohormones. Although some of these compounds have growth-promoting properties on plants, the molecular mechanisms that underly seaweed extract action remain understudied. In this paper, we review the role of these extracts and their bioactive compounds as plant biostimulants. The targeted application of seaweed extract to improve crop performance and protein accumulation is also discussed."
1,"Marine heatwaves can cause coral bleaching and reduce coral cover on reefs, yet few studies have identified bright spots, where corals have recently shown a capacity to survive such pressures. We analyzed 7714 worldwide surveys from 1997 to 2018 along with 14 environmental and temperature metrics in a hierarchical Bayesian model to identify conditions that contribute to present-day coral cover. We also identified locations with significantly higher (i.e., bright spots) and lower coral cover (i.e., dark spots) than regionally expected. In addition, using 4-km downscaled data of Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5, we projected coral cover on reefs for the years 2050 and 2100. Coral cover on modern reefs was positively associated with historically high maximum sea-surface temperatures (SSTs), and negatively associated with high contemporary SSTs, tropical-cyclone frequencies, and human-population densities. By 2100, under RCP8.5, we projected relative decreases in coral cover of >40% on most reefs globally but projected less decline on reefs in Indonesia, Malaysia, the central Philippines, New Caledonia, Fiji, and French Polynesia, which should be focal localities for multinational networks of protected areas."
1,"Fire is a key ecosystem driver in savannahs and it can have large impacts on species distribution and density. A re-examination of fire management in Kruger National Park is currently under review with the objective to maintain natural ecosystem dynamics and favour tourists' ability to observe animals. We used data on location, intensity and frequency of fires and census data on three species considered as rare and of conservation concern in the park, tsessebe, roan and sable antelope to estimate the relationship between fire occurrence and species occurrence and density. We also investigated the impacts of different environmental predictors on antelope populations. The model predictors that most affected the density and presence of antelopes were mean fire return period, the type of geological substrate and the presence of water-points. We then used our models to evaluate different fire management scenarios and make recommendations for an optimal fire management strategy for the conservation of these rare antelopes. We also tested our scenarios under different precipitation conditions, in order to investigate the likely response of species to climate change. Roan antelope is the most sensitive species to climatic variations, while sable seems to be the most resilient. The approach described here can also be used to improve the conservation of locally rare species in other regions and habitats. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
1,"Earlier research largely ignored the effects of climate change on the growth of agricultural total factor productivity (TFP) in Africa. This study shows how climate inputs impact TFP growth in addition to other productivity growth indicators and metrics, as well as how they can impact overall input efficiency as productivity drivers. We use a panel of 42 African nations from 1999 to 2019 and a nonparametric data envelopment analysis-Malmquist technique. The non-parametric analysis revealed that the average growth rate of the non-climate-induced TFP estimates was 1.9%, while the average growth rate of the climate-induced TFP estimates was 2.4%. Accounting for temperature and precipitation separately, TFP grew by 2.3% on average. This growth rate (2.3%) is slightly less than the combined effect of temperature and precipitation (2.4%) but higher than the typical TFP growth rate (1.9%) that ignores climate variables, indicating that TFP growth in African agriculture risks being underestimated when climate inputs are ignored. We also find the distribution of the climate effects to vary across regions. In northern Africa, for example, the temperature-induced TFP growth rates were negative due to rising temperature in the region. Evidence from the decomposed TFP estimates indicates that climate variables also influence productivity determinants. However, technology improvement is fundamental to mitigating the effects of extreme weather inputs on TFP growth in Africa's agriculture. As a result, a few policy suggestions are provided to help policymakers deal with the effects of climate change on TFP growth in Africa's agriculture and ensure food security. The study advocated for a reevaluation of the climate-agriculture effect in order to fully comprehend the role of climate factors and their contributions to agricultural TFP growth in Africa."
1,"Conventional engine test-cycles usually do not represent real driving emissions. Due to their relevance for human health and their effect on climate change, determination of real driving emissions by portable emission measurement systems (PEMS) becomes increasingly important. The purpose of this work is to measure real world gaseous and particulate emission components of diesel and vegetable oil fuel operated mobile agricultural machinery with PEMS. Variation and comparison of machine work types as well as operating conditions will show the range of fluctuation and are basis for optimisation processes. Additionally, this work will support the development of propulsion systems that are more efficient and have lower impacts on air quality and climate change. First results show that real driving emissions of tractors fulfill related proposed limits easily. The results however, have to be verified within ongoing measurements."
1,"Global warming threatens ecosystem functions, biodiversity, and rangeland productivity in Mongolia. The study analyzes the spatial and temporal distributions of the Net Primary Production (NPP) and its response to climatic parameters. The study also highlights how various land cover types respond to climatic fluctuations from 2003 to 2018. The Boreal Ecosystem Productivity Simulator (BEPS) model was used to simulate the rangeland NPP of the last 16 years. Satellite remote sensing data products were mainly used as input for the model, where ground-based and MODIS NPP were used to validate the model result. The results indicated that the BEPS model was moderately effective (R-2 = 0.59, the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) = 13.22 g C m(-2)) to estimate NPP for Mongolian rangelands (e.g., grassland and sparse vegetation). The validation results also showed good agreement between the BEPS and MODIS estimates for all vegetation types, including forest, shrubland, and wetland (R-2 = 0.65). The annual total NPP of Mongolia showed a slight increment with an annual increase of 0.0007 Pg (0.68 g C per meter square) from 2003 to 2018 (p = 0.82) due to the changes in climatic parameters and land cover change. Likewise, high increments per unit area found in forest NPP, while decreased NPP trend was observed in the shrubland. In conclusion, among the three climatic parameters, temperature was the factor with the largest influence on NPP variations (r = 0.917) followed precipitation (r = 0.825), and net radiation (r = 0.787). Forest and wetland NPP had a low response to precipitation, while inter-annual NPP variation shows grassland, shrubland, and sparse vegetation were highly sensitive rangeland types to climate fluctuations."
1,"The agro-food system needs a genuine sustainability transition to achieve sustainable food and nutrition security in the face of climate change, population growth, ecosystem degradation and increasing resource scarcity. Agro-food sustainability transitions refer to transformation processes needed to move towards sustainable agriculture and food systems. There is a broad range of theoretical and conceptual frameworks that have been used to understand and promote transition towards sustainability. These include the multi-level perspective (MLP) on socio-technical transitions, transition management (TM), strategic niche management (SNM), technological innovation system (TIS) and social practice approach (SPA). The paper analyses the use of these heuristic frameworks in research on agro-food sustainability transitions. A search carried out in March 2018 on Scopus yielded 791 documents, and 127 research articles underwent a systematic review. Results show that more than three-fifths of research papers dealing with sustainability transitions in agriculture, food processing, distribution and consumption use at least one of the five heuristic frameworks (MLP, TM, SNM, TIS and SPA). The MLP is the most prominent framework in research on agro-food sustainability transitions, followed by TM, SPA, SNM and then TIS. Nevertheless, MLP is increasingly complemented with frameworks that focus on human-related and social factors (SPA), management and governance (TM, SNM) or agency and interactions between actors (TIS) in sustainability transitions processes. Therefore, the paper makes the case for more integration of transition frameworks in order to better nurture and foster transitions towards sustainable agro-food systems."
1,"Indigenous Solomon Islanders, like many living in Pacific Small Island Developing States (PSIDS), are currently experiencing the global syndemic-the combined threat of obesity, undernutrition, and climate change. This mixed-method study aimed to assess nutrition transitions and diet quality by comparing three geographically unique rural and urban indigenous Solomon Islands populations. Participants in rural areas sourced more energy from wild and cultivated foods; consumed a wider diversity of foods; were more likely to meet WHO recommendations of >400 g of non-starchy fruits and vegetables daily; were more physically active; and had significantly lower body fat, waist circumference, and body mass index (BMI) when compared to urban populations. Urban populations were found to have a reduced ability to self-cultivate agri-food products or collect wild foods, and therefore consumed more ultra-processed foods (classified as NOVA 4) and takeout foods, and overall had less diverse diets compared to rural populations. Clear opportunities to leverage traditional knowledge and improve the cultivation and consumption of underutilized species can assist in building more sustainable and resilient food systems while ensuring that indigenous knowledge and cultural preferences are respected."
1,"Mediterranean hurricanes, also known as medicanes, can cause significant damage to coastal communities. Consequently, they have been the subject of intense study in recent decades. Geographic Information Systems (GISs) and Web-GIS applications are essential for processing and analyzing geographic data from various sources, particularly in the field of spatial planning. Due to their ability to integrate heterogeneous information, these tools can provide experts with a comprehensive overview of relevant geospatial data. Here, we present ARCHIMEDE, a relational geodatabase connected to an open-source Web-GIS platform focused on Mediterranean hurricanes that contains data from recent research on these extreme weather phenomena. These datasets comprise climatic and oceanographic data obtained from remote sensing techniques as well as seismic and geomorphological data obtained from field observations. Consequently, this Web-GIS platform can enhance our understanding of Mediterranean cyclones by relating the physical properties of these natural phenomena with their impacts on coastal regions. ARCHIMEDE is an innovative tool for the dissemination of geographic information to stakeholders, researchers, and decision-makers, offering valuable support for the development of robust coastal management strategies aimed at mitigating the challenges posed by Mediterranean hurricanes."
1,"Italy is experiencing the negative effects of climate change, which is causing considerable damage. Evidence of the damage is increasing citizens' concern about climate change. According to many researchers, investigating the factors that drive and shape risk perception of climate change is of paramount importance to predicting public willingness to help combat it. Recently, the Climate Change Risk Perception model (CCRPM) was validated, showing its efficacy. However, the CCRPM does not consider some psychological variables related to people's confidence that climate change can be mitigated. The purpose of the present study is to replicate CCRPM in the Italian context and to shed light on whether the addition of the Climate Change Hope variable can improve the explanatory power of this model. Results indicate that the CCRPM explains 49% of the variance of climate change risk perception and the addition of Climate Change Hope improves the model. Knowledge of impacts of climate change, social norms, value orientations, affect, and personal experience with extreme weather events were all identified as significant predictors. Affective and social norms factors explained significantly more variance in risk perception than other variables. These results suggest that climate change risk perception is a complex and multidimensional construct and that risk communicators should take an integrative approach by stimulating citizens' affective and experiential processing mechanisms."
1,"Better constraining the continental climate response to anthropogenic forcing is essential to improve climate projections. In this study, pattern scaling is used to extract, from observations, the patterned response of sea surface temperature (SST) and sea ice concentration (SICE) to anthropogenically dominated long-term global warming. The SST response pattern includes a warming of the tropical Indian Ocean, the high northern latitudes, and the western boundary currents. The SICE pattern shows seasonal variations of the main locations of sea ice loss. These SST-SICE response patterns are used to drive an ensemble of an atmospheric general circulation model, the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Atmosphere Model, version 5 (CAM5), over the period 1980-2010 along with a standard AMIP ensemble using observed SST-SICE. The simulations enable attribution of a variety of observed trends of continental climate to global warming. On the one hand, the warming trends observed in all seasons across the entire Northern Hemisphere extratropics result from global warming, as does the snow loss observed over the northern midlatitudes and northwestern Eurasia. On the other hand, 1980-2010 precipitation trends observed in winter over North America and in summer over Africa result from the recent decreasing phase of the Pacific decadal oscillation and the recent increasing phase of the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation, respectively, which are not part of the global warming signal. The method holds promise for near-term decadal climate prediction but as currently framed cannot distinguish regional signals associated with oceanic internal variability from aerosol forcing and other sources of short-term forcing."
1,"Climate change can affect tree recruitment altering post-dispersal seed fates and impairing seedling development, and these effects will be stronger at man-disturbed areas than beneath forest canopies. Seed biomass, however, positively influences tree recruitment processes and its relevance increases with environmental harshness. Therefore, this seed trait may become critical for forest regeneration under climate change scenarios. We experimentally tested these hypotheses with two Mexican oaks that dominate forests at sites where temperature will increase and rainfall will decrease in the next 20 years. At both experimental sites, we sowed acorns of varying biomass at forest understories and deforested areas under the current climate and simulated climate change conditions. We measured microclimate, incidence of seed parasitism by insects and fungi, germination, shoot emergence, and seedling survival and growth over a year. Temperature in climate change simulations was increased 2 degrees C and rainfall was reduced 17-18%, and this concurred with the near-term changes expected for both variables at the experimental sites. Climate change conditions intensified insect parasitism and decreased fungal infestation on seeds, but these effects were only found within forests and they did not relate with propagule size. Increased warming and drought reduced germination, shoot emergence, and seedling survival and growth at forests and deforested areas, but all these processes were positively related with seed biomass. Indeed, in an oak species, these relationships displaced towards bigger-sized seeds under climate change conditions. Our findings suggest that climate change can alter the intensity of seed-parasite interactions and impair tree establishment processes, also suggesting that this phenomenon will favor large-sized over small-sized seeds during recruitment of some tree species."
1,"Nowadays, the most significant consequence of climate change is drought stress. Drought is one of the important, alarming, and hazardous abiotic stresses responsible for the alterations in soil environment affecting soil organisms, including microorganisms and plants. It alters the activity and functional composition of soil microorganisms that are responsible for crucial ecosystem functions and services. These stress conditions decrease microbial abundance, disturb microbial structure, decline microbial activity, including enzyme production (e.g., such as oxidoreductases, hydrolases, dehydrogenase, catalase, urease, phosphatases, beta-glucosidase) and nutrient cycling, leading to a decrease in soil fertility followed by lower plant productivity and loss in economy. Interestingly, the negative effects of drought on soil can be minimized by adding organic substances such as compost, sewage slugs, or municipal solid waste that increases the activity of soil enzymes. Drought directly affects plant morphology, anatomy, physiology, and biochemistry. Its effect on plants can also be observed by changes at the transcriptomic and metabolomic levels. However, in plants, it can be mitigated by rhizosphere microbial communities, especially by plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) and fungi (PGPF) that adapt their structural and functional compositions to water scarcity. This review was undertaken to discuss the impacts of drought stress on soil microbial community abundance, structure and activity, and plant growth and development, including the role of soil microorganisms in this process. Microbial activity in the soil environment was considered in terms of soil enzyme activities, pools, fluxes, and processes of terrestrial carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles. A deep understanding of many aspects is necessary to explore the impacts of these extreme climate change events. We also focus on addressing the possible ways such as genome editing, molecular analysis (metagenomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics) towards finding better solutions for mitigating drought effects and managing agricultural practices under harsh condition in a profitable manner."
1,"Paleoecological evidence and paleoclimatic records indicate that there was a plant poleward migration in latitude and an upward shift in elevation with increased temperatures after the last glaciation. Recent studies have shown that global warming over the past 100 years has been having a noticeable effect on living systems. Current global warming is causing a poleward and upward shift in the range of many plants and animals. Climate change, in connection with other global changes, is threatening the survival of a wide range of plant and animal species. This raises the question: can existing reserves really preserve current levels of biological diversity in the long term given the present rapid pace of climate change? The present paper deals with this question in the context of the responses of plants and animals to global climate change, based on a literature review. Consequently, we recommend expanding reserves towards the poles and/or towards higher altitudes, to permit species to shift their ranges to keep pace with global warming."
1,"The Ranger uranium mine is surrounded by the World Heritage Kakadu National Park, Australia, and is upstream of the Ramsar-listed wetlands of the Magela Creek floodplain. We present the results of a Quantitative Ecological Risk Assessment (QERA) for the floodplain that combines both point source mining risks and diffuse non-mining landscape-scale risks. A high level of protection for the biodiversity of aquatic ecosystems was used as the assessment endpoint. Mining risks in the surface water pathway were assessed for four key mine-associated solutes (uranium, manganese, magnesium, and sulphate), and non-mining landscape-scale risks were assessed for weeds, feral pig damage, unmanaged dry season fire, and saltwater intrusion from potential sea-level rise due to climate change. Results show that non-mining landscape-scale risks are currently several orders of magnitude greater than risks from mine water contaminants. A weed (Para grass; Urocloa mutica) is the major ecological risk because of its extent, effect, and rapid spread rate. The QERA was incorporated into a Bayesian Belief Network to help evaluate different management strategies. We conclude that non-mining landscape-scale risks to the floodplain should receive the same level of close scrutiny and investment as that applied to uranium mining risks."
1,"Agriculture contributes significant volumes of livestock faeces to land. Understanding how faecal microbes respond to shifts in meteorological patterns of contrasting seasons is important in order to gauge how environmental (and human health) risks may alter under a changing climate. The aim of this study was to: (i) quantify the temporal pattern of E. coli growth within dairy faeces post defecation; and (ii) derive E. coli seasonal population change profiles associated with contrasting environmental drivers. Evaluation of the die-off dynamics of E. coli revealed that a treatment mimicking drought and warming conditions significantly enhanced persistence relative to E. coli in faeces that were exposed to field conditions, and that this pattern was consistent across consecutive years. The internal temperature of faeces was important in driving the rate of change in the E. coli population in the immediate period post defecation, with most E. coli activity (as either die-off or growth) occurring at low dry matter content. This study highlighted that the use of seasonal E. coli persistence profiles should be approached with caution when modelling environmental and human health risks given the increased likelihood of atypical seasonal meteorological variables impacting on E. coli growth and die-off."
1,"The Sultanate of Oman overlooks three water bodies: The Arabian Sea, the Sea of Oman and the Arabian Gulf with a coastal face of more than 3000 km. Due to the recent global climate change, storm intensity has increased and inundation of coastal areas is inevitable. The pattern of coastal flooding depends on the geomorphologic and oceanographic characteristics of the coastal zone. The current research aims to delineate the susceptibility of Omani coast to the sudden sea level rise from cyclones and tsunamis using the coastal vulnerability index (CVI). Five physical parameters were implemented to perform the CVI, namely: The coastal geomorphology, elevation, slope, tidal range and bathymetry of the nearshore zone. Data were extracted from remotely sensed images and government resources assisted by field surveying. Geospatial analysis using geographical information system (GIS) was performed to manipulate and process the CVI from the collected data. Results showed that high vulnerable coastal regions to sea level rise account for 805 km of the coast, mostly along Al-Batinah plain in the north and along some scattered sectors at the eastern coast of the country. Major settlements and infrastructures are located at high CVI category. Moderate vulnerable coasts total 695 km mostly at the headlands along the Arabian Sea, whereas the low vulnerability coasts include the remaining shores along Musandam Peninsula and the eastern coast. This study provides a national map of the coastal vulnerability to the sea level rise, which is important for urban planning and decision supports for a sustainable management of Omani coastal zone."
1,"Among natural disasters, hurricanes pose significant threat to port infrastructure in the United States, especially to those along the coasts of the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. The operational continuity of ports is critical because of the growing reliance of domestic and international businesses on ports and their significance in the growth of national and regional economies. While direct physical damages to ports are not rare, a shutdown of port operations is more likely declared by authorities as a precautionary and preparatory measure during hurricanes. Considering the enormous economic importance of ports and their vulnerability to hurricanes, the current study proposes a framework and methodology to analyze the economic risks of such hurricane-related shutdowns using hurricane- and port-related determinants. The risks of shutdowns are modeled using regression analysis based on historical port shutdown data and are combined with extensions of the well-known input-output model to predict the operational and economic risks of ports to hurricanes. The application of the methodology is demonstrated by conducting a case study based on the Texas Port System to evaluate the economic risks of hurricane-related port disruptions on the U.S. economy."
1,"A synthesis is presented highlighting the importance of hydrologic variables and dynamics to biodiversity patterns. The focus of this paper is the key hydrologic controls crucial towards quantifying the impacts of climate changes on the distribution of species. Specifically, we highlight the hydrologic controls operating on the carrying capacity, niche formation, and dispersal dynamics. This synthesis will facilitate avenues of future research and is connected to issues of major practical importance, such as the integration of the structure of river networks into conservation strategies and the evaluations of the impacts of climate change on biodiversity.

1,"This paper describes the potential impacts of warming temperatures and changing precipitation on plants, wildlife, invasive species, pests, and agricultural ecosystems across the multi-state region centered on Chicago, Illinois. We examine a geographic area that captures much of Lake Michigan, including a complex mosaic of urbanization and agriculture surrounding southern Lake Michigan. We consider species currently present within this broad region as well as species that are expected to move into or out of the area as climate zones shift northward through the coming century. Our analysis draws upon disparate data sources to compile projections. We conclude that a complex mixture of land use poses particular challenges to natural ecosystems in this region under climate change. Dispersal is likely to be limited for some species, and some populations of native taxa may already be reduced due to habitat loss. Other species can persist, even thrive, within a mixed landscape mosaic, provided natural areas and green spaces are available. If such spaces are somehow connected, they can provide opportunities for native species to inhabit and move through the metropolitan region (perhaps even better than the landscapes previously dominated by agriculture). Strategies for adapting regional agriculture and minimizing pest outbreaks also call for creative management intervention. With additional research, Chicago and its surrounding environs have an opportunity to provide leadership on effective management of natural resources under climate change. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

0,"The projected change in intense extratropical cyclones in the Northern Hemisphere winter due to global warming is investigated using 11 climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). In many models, the number of intense surface cyclones (sea-level pressure below 980 hPa) increases on the polar and downstream side of the storm tracks, and the mean growth rate of the cyclones is enhanced in areas upstream of these regions, especially in the North Pacific. Around these regions, the mean growth rate is highly correlated with the upper-level zonal wind on a monthly time scale, and its projected change can be largely explained by the zonal wind change. An enhanced polar jet over the North Pacific seen in many models leads to an enhanced mean growth rate of surface cyclones, while less agreement between the models is seen over the North Atlantic. Citation: Mizuta, R. (2012), Intensification of extratropical cyclones associated with the polar jet change in the CMIP5 global warming projections, Geophys. Res. Lett., 39, L19707, doi:10.1029/2012GL053032."
1,"Chytridiomycosis, caused by the pathogenic fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), has contributed to amphibian declines globally, but drivers of outbreaks vary locally. Here, we explore the role of drought in population and host-disease dynamics of the endangered stream-breeding foothill yellow-legged frog (Rana boylii). In central California (USA) where severity of seasonal drought is increasing, we observed the non-native, Bd-tolerant and lentic-adapted North American bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus) extend into streams when flood disturbance was minimal. Analysis of skin swabs revealed that prevalence and load of Bd infection among bullfrogs was low. Yet, among the native frogs, prevalence and load intensified as the seasonal drought progressed and surface flow became intermittent. When temperatures decreased in autumn and frogs concentrated at a reduced number of water points, we found dozens of dead foothill yellow-legged frogs (2018-2019). Necropsies suggested chytridiomycosis as the likely cause of death. Despite recent lethal outbreaks, foothill yellow-legged frog population abundance appeared resilient based on comparison to prior decades when no die-offs were observed. Wet-dry mapping of the stream channel and retrospective analysis of hydrologic records revealed that the native frogs spawn away from perennial pools, a behaviour that may allow them to avoid bullfrogs and predatory fish. In an ecological trade-off, tadpoles face the risk of the stream drying before metamorphosis. Fluctuations in population size thus corresponded to extremes of inter-annual variation in streamflow that limit recruitment rather than disease outbreaks. We conclude that hydrologic constraints, which climate change may exacerbate, appear to override the stressors of non-indigenous species and chytridiomycosis."
1,"A deeper understanding of past vegetation dynamics is required to better assess future vegetation responses to global warming in the Alps. Lake sediments from Lac de Bretaye, a small subalpine lake in the Northern Swiss Alps (1780 m a.s.l.), were analysed to reconstruct past vegetation dynamics for the entire Holocene, using pollen, macrofossil and charcoal analyses as main proxies. The results show that timberline reached the lake's catchment area at around 10,300 cal. BP, supporting the hypothesis of a delayed postglacial afforestation in the Northern Alps. At the same time, thermophilous trees such as Ulmus, Tilia and Acer established in the lowlands and expanded to the altitude of the lake, forming distinctive boreo-nemoral forests with Betula, Pinus cembra and Larix decidua. From about 5000 to 3500 cal. BP, thermophilous trees declined because of increasing human land use, mainly driven by the mass expansion of Picea abies and severe anthropogenic fire activity. From the Bronze Age onwards (c. 4200-2800 cal. BP), grazing indicators and high values for charcoal concentration and influx attest an intensifying human impact, fostering the expansion of Alnus viridis and Picea abies. Hence, biodiversity in alpine meadows increased, whereas forest diversity declined, as can be seen in other regional records. We argue that the anticipated climate change and decreasing human impact in the Alps today will not only lead to an upward movement of timberline with consequent loss of area for grasslands, but also to a disruption of Picea abies forests, which may allow the re-expansion of thermophilous tree species."
1,"As part of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), the Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison Project for CMIP6 (ISMIP6) was devised to assess the likely sea-level-rise contribution from the Earth's ice sheets. Here, we construct an ensemble of climate forcings for Antarctica until the year 2300 based on original ISMIP6 forcings until 2100, combined with climate indices from simulations with the MIROC4m climate model until 2300. We then use these forcings to run simulations for the Antarctic ice sheet with the SICOPOLIS model. For the unabated warming pathway RCP8.5/SSP5-8.5, the ice sheet suffers a severe mass loss, amounting to similar to 1.5 m SLE (sea-level equivalent) for the fourteen-experiment mean, and similar to 3.3 m SLE for the most sensitive experiment. Most of this loss originates from West Antarctica. For the reduced emissions pathway RCP2.6/SSP1-2.6, the loss is limited to a three-experiment mean of similar to 0.16 m SLE. The means are approximately two times larger than what was found in a previous study (Chambers and others, 2022, doi:10.1017/jog.2021.124) that assumed a sustained late-21st-century climate beyond 2100, demonstrating the importance of post-2100 climate trends on Antarctic mass changes in the 22nd and 23rd centuries."
1,"Expansion of oil palm plantations is under intense public scrutiny as it causes tropical deforestation and biodiversity loss in Southeast Asia. Despite the fact that extensive studies exploring topics related to palm oil land use, climate change, and deforestation, little is known regarding the international public's perceptions of palm oil's impacts on environmental issues. The objective of this study is to identify trends and patterns and categorize relevant themes of public opinions in this regard. With a large dataset of 4260 online posts gleaned from YouTube and Reddit, we apply the Institutional theory and social movements to analyze palm oil discussions in the social media context. Our major findings are: (1) the public has negative views on palm oil. Several drivers of environmental destruction are greed, corruption, profit, and capitalism; (2) social media campaigns against palm oil are highly successful. However, negative sentiments from consumers reveal ongoing institutional failures; (3) public opinion is polarized in terms of viewpoints on socioeconomics and the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil; (4) global consumers' response to boycott palm oil products and seek for other solutions are driven by corporations' profit-driven malpractice and weak governmental legislation and governance. This study is the first attempt to apply big data of social media accounts to analyze consumers' perceptions of palm oil and its environmental impacts. It also proposes a predictive model for understanding factors and mechanisms of how social media applications can potentially stimulate and influence an international sustainability debate over palm oil.

1,"The divergence of total alkalinity (TA) from conservation with salinity (S) and relatively acidic conditions (pH) in surface seawater was suggested to explain the high prevalence of lightning superbolts in the Mediterranean sea, North sea and upwelling regions of the oceans. In this study we tested the combined effects of changes in S, TA and pH of Mediterranean sea surface water on the intensity of laboratory generated electrical sparks, which are considered to be analogous to cloud to sea-surface intensity of lightning discharges. The experimental results were used to develop a multivariate linear equation (MLE) of Lightning Flash Intensity (LFI) as a function of S, TA/S and pH. This relation was validated with wintertime (DJF) LFI measurements along a Mediterranean sea zonal profile during the period 2009-2020 compared to corresponding climate model outputs of S, TA and pH. Based on the resulting MLE, the combined effects of climate change, ocean acidification and the damming of the Nile, may have increased LFI in the Levantine Sea by 16 +/- 14% until now relative to the pre-Aswan Dam period. Furthermore, assuming that salinization and acidification of the Levantine Sea will continue at current trends, the LFI is predicted to increase by 25 +/- 13% by the year 2050."
1,"Increased anthropogenic pressures on coastal marine ecosystems in the last century are threatening their biodiversity and functioning. Global warming and increases in nutrient loadings are two major stressors affecting these systems. Global warming is expected to increase both atmospheric and water temperatures and increase precipitation and terrestrial runoff, further increasing organic matter and nutrient inputs to coastal areas. Dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) concentrations frequently exceed those of dissolved inorganic nitrogen in aquatic systems. Many components of the DON pool have been shown to supply nitrogen nutrition to phytoplankton and bacteria. Predictions of how global warming and eutrophication will affect metabolic rates and dissolved oxygen dynamics in the future are needed to elucidate their impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Here, we experimentally determine simultaneous DON additions and warming on planktonic community metabolism in the Baltic Sea, the largest coastal area suffering from eutrophication-driven hypoxia. Both bacterioplankton community composition and metabolic rates changed in relation to temperature. DON additions from wastewater treatment plant effluents significantly increased the activation energies for community respiration and gross primary production. Activation energies for community respiration were higher than those for gross primary production. Results support the prediction that warming of the Baltic Sea will enhance planktonic respiration rates faster than it will for planktonic primary production. Higher increases in respiration rates than in production may lead to the depletion of the oxygen pool, further aggravating hypoxia in the Baltic Sea."
1,"A 2-degree global warming is likely to affect the production, deposition, and transport of air pollutants, leading to impacts on air quality and health. In the present study we use an ensemble of four regional chemistry-transport models, driven by meteorological data from different climate models, to assess such changes and their uncertainties for PM2.5 and SOMO35. Changes and uncertainties are compared to the inter-model variability. We find that the impact of regional climate change on PM2.5, averaged over the model ensemble, ranges from -0.5 mu g.m(-3) to +1.3 mu g.m(-3) over Europe. It mainly results from changes in natural and biogenic emissions, such as desert dust, sea salt and biogenic VOCs. Statistically significant decreases in PM2.5 are found over southwestern Russia and Ukraine as well as an increase over Southern Spain. Modeled changes in summer ozone levels range from -1.7 to 1.6 ppbv. We find a smaller ensemble-mean evolution of SOMO35 as compared to inter-model variability. We also investigate the uncertainty due to inter-decadal variability and find that 10-year periods may not be sufficient to allow the detection of statistically significant change signals."
1,"Vector-borne diseases (VBDs) are caused by infectious pathogens that spread from an infected human or animal reservoir to an uninfected human via a vector (mosquito, tick, rodent, others) and remain an important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Pregnant individuals and their fetuses are especially at risk, as certain pathogens, such as Zika virus, have specific implications in pregnancy and for neonatal health. Global climate change is affecting the incidence and geographic spread of many VBDs. Thus, it is important for clinicians in the fields of obstetrics/gynecology and newborn medicine, regardless of geographic location, to familiarize themselves with a basic understanding of these conditions and how climate change is altering their distributions. In this chapter, we review the incidence, clinical presentation, implications during pregnancy and intersection with climate change for four of the most important VBDs in pregnancy: malaria, Zika, dengue and Chagas disease. Although not exhaustive of all VBDs, a more extensive table is included for reference, and our discussion provides a helpful framework for understanding other vector-borne pathogens and perinatal health."
1,"Heat waves give rise to order of magnitude higher mortality rates than other weather-related natural disasters. Unfortunately both the severity and amplitude of heat waves are predicted to increase worldwide as a consequence of climate change. Hence, meteorological services have a growing need to identify such periods in order to set alerts, whilst researchers and industry need representative future heat waves to study risk. This paper introduces a new location-specific mortality risk focused definition of heat waves and a new mathematical framework for the creation of time series that represents them. It focuses on identifying periods when temperatures are high during the day and night, as this coincidence is strongly linked to mortality. The approach is tested using observed data from Brazil and the UK. Comparisons with previous methods demonstrate that this new approach represents a major advance that can be adopted worldwide by governments, researchers and industry. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

1,"Climate change involves warmer temperatures, altered precipitation patterns, increased climatic variability and, in Mediterranean regions, increased frequency and severity of droughts. Tree species may show different growth responses to these components of climatic change, which may trigger changes in forest composition and dominance. We assessed the influence of recent climatic changes on secondary growth of mature trees from four species co-occurring in a Mediterranean continental forest: Quercus ilex, Quercus faginea, Pinus nigra and Juniperus thurifera. We used dendrochronology to relate radial-growth variables [earlywood and latewood widths, basal area increment (BAI)] to annual and seasonal climatic variables for the period 1977-2007. Our results showed that Q. faginea BAI has declined, whereas J. thurifera BAI has increased over time while Q. ilex and P. nigra have maintained their growth rates. Growth was mainly favored by higher precipitations and tree size for all species. Reduced growth during extremely dry years was observed for all study species, but all of them except Q. faginea recovered their growth levels 2 years after drought. Our findings illustrate how the effects of climatic changes on growth should include analyses of seasonal climatic trends and extreme events such as severe droughts. We conclude that the seasonal timing of warming and precipitation alterations leading to drought events caused contrasting effects on growth of co-occurring Mediterranean tree species, compromising their future coexistence."
1,"The quantitative and qualitative evaluations of long-term trends and spatial distribution of heatwaves (HW) are carried out in Southern Armenia (Syunik province). For this purpose, the daily average maximum air temperature data (T-max) from four meteorological stations (Sisian, Goris, Kapan, and Meghri) are studied for the 1936-2019 period. The HW catchment algorithm and a new concept of HW (which is called potential HWs [PHWs]) are developed. The presence of trends and their significance for different HW measures are assessed utilizing linear and exponential trends, Sen's slope, and Mann-Kendall (MK) trend test. The results show that HWs become increasingly frequent and intense. Moreover, they have extended duration, as they emerge earlier and fade later in Syunik province. Significant variation trends of HW are observed (e.g., the frequency of HWs increased up to five times), especially after the 1990s in southern and central parts of the province. Contrary to this, relatively weaker or no trends occurred in the northern parts. Our methodological approach successfully determines the HW measures' trends in the province based on the relief features and altitude differences. The outcomes highlight their notable impact on the progression of HW. Overall, this study provides significant insights into understanding HW's variations and their transformation in the mountainous areas."
1,"As climate change brings about hotter and often drier summers, an improved understanding of how irrigation requirements vary according to climatic conditions is of increasing importance. Within Germany, temperate conditions have historically enabled most agriculture to be supplied solely by green water, but recent crop yield reductions and crop failures have demonstrated its increased vulnerability to climatic conditions. The raster -based mGROWA hydrological water balance model was implemented over all agricultural areas in Germany for the period 1961-2020 at a high spatial (200 m) and temporal (daily) resolution. Grid-cells were each assigned one of 10 major crop classes, which account for 86.7 % of all agricultural areas in Germany, and effectively all irrigated areas. Using crop-specific irrigation rules that reflect actual practices, irrigation requirements were simulated for all crop areas. To investigate the relationship between climatic water balance over the crop growing season and irrigation requirements, the simulated annual irrigation requirements were compared with the standardised precipitation-evapotranspiration index (SPEI-6), calculated at the end of September. Through this comparison, irrigation requirements could be characterised for near-normal and dry conditions, and results were aggregated to the district level. Additionally, using district-level data on the areas with irrigation infra-structure, the actual water used for irrigation was estimated. The results highlight marked increases in irrigation requirements in dry conditions compared to near-normal conditions (median increase of 72 %), which are more pronounced over crops in silty soils than in sandy soils. The results also demonstrate how the increased irrigation requirements in dry years are in many cases higher than what is suggested by guidelines for irrigation man-agement in Germany. This study provides important information for actors related to the agricultural sector and water management and is based on a robust and transferable framework to quantify how irrigation requirements vary according to climatic variability and local soil conditions."
1,"Potatoes have emerged as a key non-grain crop for food security worldwide. However, the looming threat of climate change poses significant risks to this vital food source, particularly through the projected reduction in crop yields under warmer temperatures. To mitigate potential crises, the development of potato varieties through genome editing holds great promise. In this study, we performed a comprehensive transcriptomic analysis to investigate microtuber development and identified several differentially expressed genes, with a particular focus on ribosomal proteins-RPL11, RPL29, RPL40 and RPL17. Our results reveal, by protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analyses, performed with the highest confidence in the STRING database platform (v11.5), the critical involvement of these ribosomal proteins in microtuber development, and highlighted their interaction with PEBP family members as potential microtuber activators. The elucidation of the molecular biological mechanisms governing ribosomal proteins will help improve the resilience of potato crops in the face of today's changing climatic conditions."
1,"Probable impacts of climate change on water resources are a great concern for hydrologists, water managers and policy makers. Global warming and climate change is expected to change the water availability. Using physically based hydrological model Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), this study assessed the sensitivity of streamflow to individual and combined changes in temperature and rainfall for the Yass River catchment of south eastern Australia. This study also predicted the change in streamflow based on three climate scenarios (B1, A1B, A2) of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Emission Scenarios and average of four general circulation models (CNRM-CM3, CSIRO-MK3.5, ECHam5 and MIROC3.2) for three future periods (2030, 2050 and 2090). Streamflow of the Yass River was found to be highly sensitive to both temperature and rainfall changes where 1 % change in rainfall might cause 3-5 % change in streamflow and flow might be reduced up to 16 % for 1 degrees C rise in temperature. Simulation results based on General Circulation Models (GCM) outputs predicted that the Yass River will likely experience huge change in streamflow due to the impact of climate change. However, due to associated uncertainties regarding climate change scenarios and climate models outputs, the results need to be evaluated carefully before making decisions in future water management and planning."
1,"Data sets designed for operational use are now being employed to monitor the earth on decadal time scales, an application outside of their original purpose. One data set, from the Microwave Sounding Unit, measures atmospheric temperature in deep layers since late 1978. Procedures for verifying and validating these data by two tests are presented: one by comparison with an independent satellite and one by comparison with radiosonde data. The results show that data from such an instrument are precise and therefore ideal for global studies. Temperatures measured by surface thermometers have considerable error for long-term studies because of various factors. Widely varying results are shown for California stations, where the few sites chosen for global temperature trend estimation are shown not to be representative of the average trend measured by over 100 stations in the state. Such a result calls into question the ability of scattered, selected surface networks to provide a true picture of long-term trends. The global temperature trend of the lower troposphere measured by the Microwave Sounding Units from January 1979 to March 1994 is -0.06 degrees C per decade."
1,"For consideration of structural design of buildings and infrastructure in Australia, this paper presents hazard modelling and mapping of extreme wind gusts under the current climate and likely future climate change. Statistical and probabilistic approaches are applied to analyse the daily extreme wind gust data recorded between 1939 and 2007 at 545 anemometer stations around Australia. The estimated hazards are compared with the regional design wind speeds specified by the structural design standard, AS/NZS 1170.2:2011. Our results indicate that, under the current climate, structures in the areas on the west of and around Brisbane, Queensland and Newcastle, New South Wales, may be under higher gust hazard than they are designed for. Sensitivity study shows that these areas are also sensitive to the projected synoptic wind intensity changes. When subjected to +/- 20 % intensity change and +/- 50 % occurrence frequency change of tropical cyclones, the northwest coast of Western Australia, the northern part of Northern Territory, and the northeast coast between Cairns and Townsville, Queensland, will experience around +/- 10 m/s changes in extreme wind gust speeds of 500-year return period."
1,"A shallow unconfined low-lying coastal aquifer in southern Finland surrounded by the Baltic Sea is vulnerable to changes in groundwater recharge, sea-level rise and human activities. Assessment of the intrinsic vulnerability of groundwater under climate scenarios was performed for the aquifer area by utilising the results of a published study on the impacts of climate change on groundwater recharge and sea-level rise on groundwater-seawater interaction. Three intrinsic vulnerability mapping methods, the aquifer vulnerability index (AVI), a modified SINTACS and GALDIT, were applied and compared. According to the results, the degree of groundwater vulnerability is greatly impacted by seasonal variations in groundwater recharge during the year, and also varies depending on the climate-change variability in the long term. The groundwater is potentially highly vulnerable to contamination from sources on the ground surface during high groundwater recharge rates after snowmelt, while a high vulnerability to seawater intrusion could exist when there is a low groundwater recharge rate in dry season. The AVI results suggest that a change in the sea level will have an insignificant impact on groundwater vulnerability compared with the results from the modified SINTACS and GALDIT. The modified SINTACS method could be used as a guideline for the groundwater vulnerability assessment of glacial and deglacial deposits in inland aquifers, and in combination with GALDIT, it could provide a useful tool for assessing groundwater vulnerability to both contamination from sources on the ground surface and to seawater intrusion for shallow unconfined low-lying coastal aquifers under future climate-change conditions."
1,"Coastal ecosystems influenced by river discharges are subjected to important environmental changes. Understanding how marine biota cope with its environment is relevant in predicting the responses to future conditions imposed by climate change. To date, a large number of studies have addressed the role of pH on shell and biomineralization properties on multiple calcifying species; however the role of salinity in combination with other stressors has been poorly studied. In particular, the edible mussel Mytilus chilensis, an important marine resource of the Chilean coasts, inhabits estuarine areas which show high natural variability in terms of pH and salinity. Here, we studied how M. chilensis shell peri-ostracum, shell organic matrix and crystal orientation are affected by different pH (8.1 and 7.7) and salinity conditions (30, 25 and 20 psu), isolated and in combination, at different time intervals. Our results show differences in the plasticity of the different biomineralogical properties studied during the experiment under the different pH and salinity treatments. While the periostracum thickness and the total shell organic matter were not affected by pH and salinity, the periostracum organic composition did. Higher amounts of polysaccharides were observed under low pH conditions after 20 days of experiment, while after 60 days, low salinity was responsible for the decrease of the polysaccharides and proteins in the periostracum. Low salinity also produced a major disorder in crystal organization at the outer shell surface. Finally, total shell weight was only affected by low pH conditions under lower salinity conditions (20 psu). From the results, in the majority of the shell properties observed we did not observe any combined effect of pH and salinity. Also, we detected that the magnitude of the impacts of salinity and pH are variable and time-dependent. This would be suggesting some level of acclimatization of M. chilensis to lower pH and salinity conditions. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
1,"Sea turtles are one of the most significant groups of marine species, playing a key role in the sustainability and conservation of marine ecosystems and the food chain. These emblematic species are threatened by several natural and anthropogenic pressures, and climate change is increasingly reported as one of the most important threats to sea turtles, affecting sea turtles at all stages of their life cycle and at both their marine and coastal habitats. The effect of climate change is expressed as global warming, sea -level rise, extreme storms, and alterations in predation and diseases' patterns, posing a potentially negative impact on sea turtles. In this systematic review, the author presented the current knowledge and research outcomes on the impact of climate change on sea turtles. Moreover, this study determined trends and hotspots in keywords, country collaborations, authors, and publications in the field through a scientometric analysis. Finally, this article reviewed proposed mitigation strategies by researchers, marine protected area (MPA) managers, and non -governmental organizations (NGOs) to reduce the impact of climate change on the conservation of sea turtles."
1,"The impacts of climate change are expected to be generally detrimental for agriculture in many parts of Africa. Overall, warming and drying may reduce crop yields by 10-20% to 2050, but there are places where losses are likely to be much more severe. Increasing frequencies of heat stress, drought and flooding events will result in yet further deleterious effects on crop and livestock productivity. There will be places in the coming decades where the livelihood strategies of rural people may need to change, to preserve food security and provide income-generating options. These are likely to include areas of Africa that are already marginal for crop production; as these become increasingly marginal, then livestock may provide an alternative to cropping. We carried out some analysis to identify areas in sub-Saharan Africa where such transitions might occur. For the currently cropped areas (which already include the highland areas where cropping intensity may increase in the future), we estimated probabilities of failed seasons for current: climate conditions, and compared these with estimates obtained for future climate conditions in 2050, using downscaled climate model output for a higher and a lower greenhouse-gas emission scenario. Transition zones can be identified where the increased probabilities of failed seasons may induce shifts from cropping to increased dependence on livestock. These zones are characterised in terms of existing agricultural system, current livestock densities, and levels of poverty. The analysis provides further evidence that climate change impacts in the marginal cropping lands may be severe, where poverty rates are already high. Results also suggest that those likely to be more affected are already more poor, on average. We discuss the implications of these results in a research-for-development targeting context that is likely to see the poor disproportionately and negatively affected by climate change.

1,"Various forest declines and forest health conditions have been described for forest ecosystems throughout the world. The connection to global warming and air pollution is clear in some area, but not in others. In this study, some evidences that support or contradict air pollution and global warming being causal factors in reported cases of decline in Eastern North America, Central Europe and Republic of Korea. Many studies suggested that forest decline phenomenon seems to be strongly associated to air pollution and global warming."
1,"Workers are uniquely susceptible to the health hazards imposed by environmental changes. Occupational and environmental medicine (OEM) providers are at the forefront of emerging health issues pertaining to working populations including climate change, and must be prepared to recognize, respond to, and mitigate climate change-related health effects in workers. This guidance document from the American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine focuses on North American workers health effects that may occur as a result of climate change and describes the responsibilities of the OEM provider in responding to these health challenges."
1,"Predicted climate change extremes, such as severe or prolonged drought, may considerably impact carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling in water-limited ecosystems. However, we lack a clear and mechanistic understanding of how extreme climate change events impact ecosystem processes belowground. This study investigates the effects of five years of reoccurring extreme growing season drought (66% reduction, extreme drought treatment) and two-month delay in monsoon precipitation (delayed monsoon treatment) on belowground productivity and biogeochemistry in two geographically adjacent semi-arid grasslands: Chihuahuan Desert grassland dominated by Bouteloua eriopoda and Great Plains grassland dominated by B. gracilis. After five years, extreme drought reduced belowground net primary productivity (BNPP) in the Chihuahuan Desert grassland but not in the Great Plains grassland. Across both grasslands, extreme drought increased soil pH and available soil nutrients nitrate and phosphate. The delayed monsoon treatment reduced BNPP in both grasslands. However, while available soil nitrate decreased in the Chihuahuan Desert grassland, the delayed monsoon treatment overall had little effect on soil ecosystem properties. Extreme drought and delayed monsoon treatments did not significantly impact soil microbial biomass, exoenzyme potentials, or soil C stocks relative to ambient conditions. Our study demonstrates that soil microbial biomass and exoenzyme activity in semi-arid grasslands are resistant to five years of extreme and prolonged growing season drought despite changes to soil moisture, belowground productivity, soil pH, and nutrient availability."
0,"To what extent did large-scale thermodynamic climate change contribute to the intensity and unusual track of Hurricane Sandy, which affected the U.S. mid-Atlantic region in late October 2012? How much of an impact would projected future climate change have on a storm such as Sandy? These questions are investigated using an ensemble of high-resolution numerical simulations in conjunction with analyzed and projected changes from a suite of general circulation models (GCMs). Simulations initialized with current analyses from the midpoint of Sandy's life cycle, while the system was centered near the Bahamas, adequately replicate the observed intensity and track of Sandy. Initial and boundary condition data are then altered with thermodynamic change fields obtained from a five-member GCM ensemble, allowing hypothetical replication of the synoptic weather pattern that accompanied Hurricane Sandy, but for large-scale thermodynamic conditions corresponding to the 1880s and for projections to the twenty-second century. The past ensemble produces a slightly weaker storm that makes landfall south of the observed location. The future ensemble depicts a significantly more intense system that makes landfall farther north, near Long Island, New York. Within the limitations of the methods used, it is suggested that climate change to date exerted only a modest influence on the intensity and track of Sandy. The strengthening in the simulations run with projected future warming is consistent with increased condensational heating; changes in the synoptic steering flow also appear to result from diabatic processes. The questions of how climate change affected Sandy's genesis and early life cycle, changes in the frequency of this type of synoptic pattern, and changes in impacts related to coastal development and sea level rise are not considered here."
1,"The Antarctic pteropod, Limacina helicina antarctica, is a dominant member of the zooplankton in the Ross Sea and supports the vast diversity of marine megafauna that designates this region as an internationally protected area. Here, we observed the response of respiration rate to abiotic stressors associated with global change-environmentally relevant temperature treatments (-0.8 degrees C, 4 degrees C) and pH treatments reflecting current-day and future modeled extremes (8.2, 7.95 and 7.7 pH at -0.8 degrees C; 8.11, 7.95 and 7.7 pH at 4 degrees C). Sampling repeatedly over a 14-day period in laboratory experiments and using microplate respirometry techniques, we found that the metabolic rate of juvenile pteropods increased in response to low-pH exposure (pH 7.7) at -0.8 degrees C, a near-ambient temperature. Similarly, metabolic rate increased when pteropods were exposed simultaneously to multiple stressors: lowered pH conditions ( pH 7.7) and a high temperature (4 degrees C). Overall, the results showed that pCO(2) and temperature interact additively to affect metabolic rates in pteropods. Furthermore, we found that L. h. antarctica can tolerate acute exposure to temperatures far beyond its maximal habitat temperature. Overall, L. h. antarctica appears to be susceptible to pH and temperature stress, two abiotic stressors which are expected to be especially deleterious for ectothermic marine metazoans in polar seas."
1,"The proposed lesson, a model active-learning activity designed to give college students experience in synthesizing information and developing a solution, can be used to address socioscientific issues across fields. As a consequence of climate change, global temperatures are anticipated to rise. This rise in temperature is expected to have a negative impact on agricultural systems due in part to increased disease incidence and decrease in crop yields. This activity is written in the context of plant pathology and agricultural systems to emphasize the importance of collaboration and communication among scientists or experts in different fields to address global agricultural issues. Students will gain an understanding of the importance of agriculture on a global scale and work together to develop a solution through the development of an agricultural policy."
1,"How precipitation responds to global warming has drawn much interest from the scientific community. However, as one of the important properties of precipitation, changes in the precipitation system scale have rarely been studied. The latest retrospective merged satellite precipitation product has provided a great opportunity to investigate quasi-global precipitation system scale changes. This study uses the Integrated Multi-satellitE Re-trievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG) data during 2001-2020 to investigate quasi-global precipitation system scale changes. Our results indicate that, generally, quasi-global precipitation system scales exhibit a significant increasing trend, which is more significant in winter and spring than that in summer and autumn over both hemispheres. The scale of nearly all precipitation systems over land regions has increased over the last two decades. In oceanic regions, precipitation system scales increase over tropical oceans but decrease over subtropical oceans. Medium-scale precipitation systems (100-1000 km) significantly increase in scale and decrease in frequency, while large-scale precipitation systems significantly increase in frequency, which both lead to a quasi-global increase in the precipitation system scale. Diagnostic investigation based on atmospheric analysis reveals that an increase in atmospheric stability tends to suppress local convective pre-cipitation, while an increase in the total column water vapor could help maintain and enhance precipitation system scale, which jointly contribute to quasi-global precipitation system scale increase."
1,"The understanding of protection initiatives' effects on the delivery of Ecosystem Services (ESs) is of paramount importance to attain sustainable management in Protected Areas (PAs). Protected floodplains provide important ESs to local populations such as water flow regulation and climate regulation through carbon storage. This study investigates the effects of biodiversity protection initiatives (i.e. declaration of Protected Areas - PAs) and the related spatio-temporal land use/land cover (LULC) changes on ecosystem services (ESs) in the Nature Reserve of Paul do Boquilobo - NRPB (Central Portugal). Special focus was made on climate mitigation (i.e. carbon storage and sequestration) and water-related (flood mitigation, water regulation and supply) ESs. The analysis was performed using InVEST model. Three dates of past LULC conditions were considered in the analysis (1967, 1990 and 2015). Moreover, two future alternative LULC scenarios for 2050 were designed (a Business- BUS and a Naturalization- NAT scenario). The BUS scenario considers a LULC distribution towards high productive agricultural systems, considering only a restricted central core of natural areas, while the NAT scenario considers full coverage of natural areas. The two future extreme LULC scenarios were analyzed considering both no climate change and climate change effects on water-related services based on the pessimistic rcp8.5 climatic scenario. The results showed that PA declaration of NRPB after 1980 increased carbon storage-sequestration and flood mitigation (higher water storage, lower recharge and runoff). The analysis of future LULC scenarios demonstrated that the complete renaturing in combination with climate change (reduction of precipitation, increase of temperature) may lead to severe reduction of recharge and runoff. These results indicate that conflicts may appear between specific water regulation services by the application of PA initiatives in places where ground-water resources are limited or minimum ecological flows in surface waters are difficult to be preserved."
1,"Being a mountainous country, Armenia has undergone different kinds of natural disasters, such as droughts, floods, and storms, which have a direct influence on economy and are expected to occur more frequently in terms of climate change, raising the need to estimate economic vulnerability especially in agricultural sector. Agriculture plays a great role in national economy of Armenia, with 21% share in Gross Domestic Production (GDP). For this reason, the estimation of agricultural resources of the country, their vulnerability towards current and future climate, and assessment of economical loss of the agricultural crop production due to climate change are the main goals of the given study. Crop productivity in dependence on climatic elements temperature, radiation, precipitation, wind field, etc. has been estimated, further on interpolating these relations for future climate conditions using climate projections in the region for the time period of 2011-2040. Data on air temperature, precipitation, relative humidity, wind speed and direction for the period of 1966-2011 have been taken from 30 stations from the measuring network of Armenian State Hydrometeorological Service. Other climatic parameters like potential and actual evapotranspiration, soil temperature and humidity, field capacity, and wilting point have been calculated with the help of an AMBAV/AMBETTI (agroclimatic) model (German Weather Service). The results showed that temperature increase accompanied with evapotranspiration increase and water availability decrease especially in low and mid-low altitudes (where the main national crop production is centralized) caused a significant shift in the phenological phases of crops, which is very important information for effective farming dates, giving an opportunity to raise efficiency of agricultural production through minimizing the yield loss due to unfavorable climatic conditions. With the help of macroeconomical analysis of the crop market, it was estimated that the economical loss of the wheat production due to even drier conditions in the future climate (2011-2040) will be more than doubled, causing essential problems in irrigation systems with sparse water resources.

1,"This paper assesses the status of coastal zones in the context of expected climate change and its related impacts, as well as current and future socioeconomic pressures and impacts. It is argued that external stresses and shocks relating to sea-level rise and other changes will tend to exacerbate existing environmental pressures and damage in coastal zones. Coastal zones are under increasing stress because of an interrelated set of planning failures including information, economic market, and policy intervention failures. Moves towards integrated coastal zone management are urgently required to guide the coevolution of natural and human systems. Overtly technocentric claims that assessments of vulnerability undertaken to date are overestimates of likely future damages from global warming are premature. While it is the case that forecasts of sea-level rise have been scaled down, much uncertainty remains over, for example, combined storm, sea surge, and other events. In any case, within the socioeconomic analyses of the problem, resource valuations have been at best only partial and have failed to incorporate sensitivity analysis in terms of the discount rates utilized. This would indicate an underestimation of potential damage costs. Overall, a precautionary approach is justified based on the need to act ahead of adequate information acquisition, economically efficient resource pricing and proactive coastal planning."

In this paper the authors, taking Veumdalen catchment in Fredrikstad as an example, simulated the possible consequences in the sewer system, in the present, predicted and artificial climate scenarios. Indicators that describe (1) surface flooding, (2) surcharging sewers, (3) basement flooding and (4) combined sewer overflow (CSO) are defined to represent the adverse effects of climate change. It is concluded from the annual-based simulation that the total volume of water spilling from the flooding manholes will increase 2-4-times the increase in precipitation, and the total CSO will increase 1.5-3-times as much as the increase in precipitation. The simulation results also show that the number of flooding manholes and number of surcharging sewers may change dramatically and irregularly with a slight change of precipitation, and vary with events and durations."
1,"Improving the climate resilience of crops is particularly important in the semi-arid tropics (SAT) where variability and uncertainty of precipitation is expected to increase under climate change with detrimental impacts on the vulnerability of livelihoods of small farm holders. This study analyses a long-term strategic experiment datasets from fifteen experiments (1981-1995) managed under different fertility levels at International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), Patancheru and on-farm balanced nutrition management trials (2010-2012) in Karnataka, India to evaluate the pearl millet performance in contrasting seasons with improved agronomic management. Long-term climate variability and yield trends were analyzed using ICRISAT's weather datasets. On-farm data analysis revealed that majority of farmers' field soils were deficient in organic carbon, available phosphorous, sulphur, zinc and boron at all the locations studied. Pearl millet grain yield and above ground dry matter was improved significantly with balanced nutrient application (NPK+S+Zn+B) in farmers' field which were critically deficient in the soil nutrients. Even in comparatively drier years, application of balanced nutrient significantly increased grain yield and aboveground dry matter which provides resilience against drought through enhanced water productivity. Long-term experiments conducted in ICRISAT showed that nitrogen application increased grain yield and above ground dry matter in pearl millet however seasonal variability had a greater effect on yield than cultivars and applied N. Pearl millet yield was positively associated with August maximum temperature and negatively with seasonal precipitation. September precipitation >125 mm which coincided with grain filling stage reduced grain yield. Benefit:cost analysis showed that balanced nutrient application of pearl millet is an economically sustainable option across the seasons. Pearl millet can be an important component of climate resilient agriculture in low production environments when managed with improved agronomic practices. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

1,"It is recognized that biodiversity changes across the planet latitudinally; however, the timing of and reasons for diversity loss at higher latitudes are not well understood. Meseguer and Condamine investigate phylogenies and fossil evidence of reptilian species and determine that global warming and cooling events allowed asymmetric extinction and dispersion across latitudes, suggesting a hypothesis where climate profoundly shapes the latitudinal diversity gradient in certain taxa."
1,"In recent years, climate change has caused extreme weather all over the world, including in Taiwan. Rainfall in Taiwan is distributed unevenly in both time and space, leading to a shortage of water resources which has become a pressing issue for the island. Groundwater plays a vital role as a backup and supplementary water resource. This study proposes a method that combines the seepage theorem, field observations, and a numerical simulation to identify high-potential groundwater resource regions to meet the demand for water supplies in future development. The Taichung Chingshui Coastal Plain (TCCP) was selected as a study area for testing the method. Two new wells were drilled in the area to obtain additional information to supplement the analysis of groundwater levels (GLs). Results indicate that the hydrological and hydrogeological parameters (e.g., Manning's coefficients, hydraulic conductivity, and formation thickness) can be obtained reasonably by comparing the numerical simulation with the observed GLs. It was found that the Dadu, Waipu, and Qingshui districts are the top three areas with higher potential groundwater resources in the TCCP. Data from the observations wells and in situ pumping stations verified our simulation results, which showed that our proposed methodology is advantageous. The research results can help improve the effective use of existing groundwater resources and assist with water resource development and sustainable usage."
1,"The Sixth Assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change describes negative effects of climate change on animals occurring on a larger scale than previously appreciated. Animal species are increasingly experiencing more frequent and extreme weather in comparison with conditions in which the species evolved. Individual variation in behavioural and physiological responses of animals to stimuli from the environment is ubiquitous across all species. Populations with relatively high levels of individual variation are more likely to be able to survive in a range of environmental conditions and cope with climate change than populations with low levels of variation. Behavioural and physiological responses are linked in animals, and personality can be defined as consistent individual behavioural and physiological responses of animals to changes in their immediate environment. Glucocorticoids (cortisol and corticosterone) are hormones that, in addition to metabolic roles, are released when the neuroendocrine stress system is activated in response to stimuli from the environment perceived to be threatening. The size of a glucocorticoid response of an animal is an indication of the animal's personality. Animals with reactive personalities have relatively high glucocorticoid responses, are relatively slow and thorough to explore new situations, and are more flexible and able to cope with changing or unpredictable conditions than animals with proactive personalities. Animals with reactive personalities are likely to be better able to cope with environmental changes due to climate change than animals with proactive personalities. A reaction norm shows the relationship between phenotype and environmental conditions, with the slope of a reaction norm for an individual animal a measure of phenotypic plasticity. If reaction norm slopes are not parallel, there is individual variation in plasticity. Populations with relatively high individual variation in plasticity of reaction norms will have more animals that can adjust to a new situation than populations with little variation in plasticity, so are more likely to persist as environments change due to climate change. Future studies of individual variation in plasticity of responses to changing environments will help understanding of how populations of animals may be able to cope with climate change."
1,"Quantification of rainfall intermittency via. interevent time distribution, series of continuous wet spells (burst size) and variability in interevent times between rainfall events is essential for planning and management of water resources and hydrologic extremes. However, their structure, quantification and association with long-term climatology are less explored. In this paper, a complex system-based measure - burstiness - is used to quantify the variability of interevent times across six meteorologically homogenous zones of India. It is observed that burstiness is related to the burst size as well as long-term rainfall climatology. The existence of unimodal and bimodal structure in burstiness distribution reveals the uniqueness and differences in the rainfall patterns. The differences in sensitivity of rainfall to burstiness highlight the role of interplay between climate-landscape and reveals the importance of the intermittent structure of rainfall. The study provides an approach to model intermittency by preserving the temporal structure of the interevent time distribution."
1,"Mountainous regions are vital biodiversity hotspots with high heterogeneity, providing essential refugia for vegetation. However, climate change threatens this diversity with the potential homogenization of the distinct environmental conditions at different elevations. Here, we used a time-series (1985-2023) of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Landsat archives (30 m) to quantify vegetation changes across an elevation gradient on Himalaya Mountain. Our analysis revealed that over the past 40 years, the Himalayas have experienced widespread greening, accompanied by homogenization of vegetation across elevations. This homogenization, characterized by a reduction in the differences between high and low elevations, can be attributed to two main factors: (1) increased warming and a higher snowmelt rate at high elevations, facilitating rapid changes in high-elevation vegetation activities; and (2) higher anthropogenic disturbance at low and mid elevations, thus inhibiting low-elevation vegetation. These factors have resulted in a reduction of habitat differentiation along the mountain slopes, homogenizing vegetation and potentially threatening the unique biodiversity adapted to specific elevational zones. Our findings emphasize the urgent need for conservation strategies that prioritize the protection of heterogeneous mountain habitats to preserve their rich biodiversity in the face of climate change."
1,"The projection of future water resources in the previous decades from the climate change impact assessment should have large uncertainties essentially. In addition, it is necessary to study the uncertainty of climate change because the projections from emission scenarios or GCMs as the beginning of impact assessment are very diverse. However, until now, the process for quantifying climate change uncertainties in previous studies is similar to the sensitivity analysis instead of the uncertainty analysis. In other words, all most studies estimated the variation range of output scenarios according to the variation of input scenarios. Therefore, this study quantifies the total uncertainty in the whole process of impact assessment that consists of a serial combination of several models (GCM, downscaling, hydrological model, and others) and the uncertainty and the ratio in each step (or model) using the maximum entropy. Furthermore, this study proposes the framework of uncertainty propagation in climate change. The methodology of this study was as follows: The first was that this study proposed the uncertainty propagation as well as the method for estimating the uncertainty in each step and classified the total uncertainties to emission scenario uncertainties and model uncertainties using the concept of uncertainty propagation from the IPCC 3rd Assessment Report. The second was that a process of climate change assessment including 2 emission scenarios, 4 GCMs, 2 downscaling techniques, and 2 hydrological models was conducted to estimate uncertainties in the impact assessment. The existing method using sensitivity analysis was also considered to compare the results from the uncertainty propagation method proposed in this study. In results, the existing method proposed that the GCMs were recognized as the largest contributor to total uncertainty (89.34 %) and this result was identical to existing results. The uncertainty propagation method proposed the uncertainty increased gradually through the process of climate change impact assessment because it was propagated step-by-step. Especially, emission scenarios in all uncertainty sources significantly contributed to the total uncertainties (larger than 50 %). The GCMs were also main contributor in model uncertainties (26.50 % of overall uncertainties). Accordingly, the future water resources will be projected very differently, depending on which emission scenarios and GCMs are selected. Therefore, it has been proven that the uncertainty propagation method can explain the entire cascade of uncertainties in the process of climate change impact assessment and quantify the uncertainties in each step."
1,"We propose a composite drought vulnerability indicator (DVI) that reflects different aspects of drought vulnerability evaluated at Pan-African level for four components: the renewable natural capital, the economic capacity, the human and civic resources, and the infrastructure and technology. The selection of variables and weights reflects the assumption that a society with institutional capacity and coordination, as well as with mechanisms for public participation, is less vulnerable to drought; furthermore, we consider that agriculture is only one of the many sectors affected by drought. The quality and accuracy of a composite indicator depends on the theoretical framework, on the data collection and quality, and on how the different components are aggregated. This kind of approach can lead to some degree of scepticism; to overcome this problem a sensitivity analysis was done in order to measure the degree of uncertainty associated with the construction of the composite indicator. Although the proposed drought vulnerability indicator relies on a number of theoretical assumptions and some degree of subjectivity, the sensitivity analysis showed that it is a robust indicator and hence able of representing the complex processes that lead to drought vulnerability. According to the DVI computed at country level, the African countries classified with higher relative vulnerability are Somalia, Burundi, Niger, Ethiopia, Mali and Chad. The analysis of the renewable natural capital component at sub-basin level shows that the basins with high to moderate drought vulnerability can be subdivided into the following geographical regions: the Mediterranean coast of Africa; the Sahel region and the Horn of Africa; the Serengeti and the Eastern Miombo woodlands in eastern Africa; the western part of the Zambezi Basin, the southeastern border of the Congo Basin, and the belt of Fynbos in the Western Cape province of South Africa. The results of the DVI at the country level were compared with drought disaster information from the EM-DAT disaster database. Even if a cause-effect relationship cannot be established between the DVI and the drought disaster database, a good agreement is observed between the drought vulnerability maps and the number of persons affected by droughts. These results are expected to contribute to the discussion on how to assess drought vulnerability and hopefully contribute to the development of drought early warning systems in Africa."
1,"Water management and particularly flood defence have a long history of collective action in low-lying countries like the Netherlands. The uncertain but potentially severe impacts of the recent climate change issue (e.g. sea level rise, extreme river discharges, salinisation) amplify the wicked and controversial character of flood safety policy issues. Policy proposals in this area generally involve drastic infrastructural works and long-term investments. They face the difficult challenge of framing problems and solutions in a publicly acceptable manner in ever changing circumstances. In this paper, we analyse and compare (1) how three key policy proposals publicly frame the flood safety issue, (2) the knowledge referred to in the framing and (3) how these frames are rhetorically connected or disconnected as statements in a long-term conversation. We find that (1) framings of policy proposals differ in the way they depict the importance of climate change, the relevant timeframe and the appropriate governance mode; (2) knowledge is selectively mobilised to underpin the different frames and (3) the frames about these proposals position themselves against the background of the previous proposals through rhetorical connections and disconnections. Finally, we discuss how this analysis hints at the importance of processes of powering and puzzling that lead to particular framings towards the public at different historical junctures.

1,"Water availability is driven by external forces, including climate change and human population growth. Inland fisheries are one of many social and economically important sectors that utilize inland waters. Increasingly, the competition for water leads to tough decisions and trade-offs are often made between water resource sectors. However, decisions that consider multiple sectors can lead to synergies in management approaches (i.e., win-win scenarios), which benefit multiple sectors. Ultimately, in searching for sustainable solutions for fish, these ecologically and socially responsible approaches can contribute to improved health, well-being, and prosperity for all water resource sectors."
0,"The study employed high-resolution atmospheric general circulation models (AGCM) to simulate tropical cyclones (TCs) and evaluated two TC genesis potential indices in reflecting projected TC changes in the western North Pacific (WNP) under a warming scenario. Both indices accurately represented the seasonal variation of TC genesis frequency (TCGF) and its spatial distribution in historical simulations and observation data. The widelyused TC genesis potential index (chi GPI) projected a significant increase in TCGF in response to a warmer ocean surface. However, this projection conflicted with the significant reduction in the model projection due to the dominant control of SST on the chi GPI. Higher SST in remote ocean basins often over dominated the destabilization effect of in-situ warmer SST and caused more stable atmospheric conditions in the WNP, resulting in fewer TC occurrences. By contrast, the revised index (chi MqGPI), which considers gross moisture condensation, projected a TCGF decrease that more accurately reflected the decreasing trend of TCGF in the warming simulations by AGCM, although the degree of reduction was smaller than that derived directly from TC detection scheme. The results suggest the plausibility of using chi MqGPI, based on the results of multimodel coarse-resolution CMIP6 climate models, to project future changes in TCGF in the WNP."
1,"Future environmental change is expected to modify the global hydrological cycle, with consequences for the regional distribution of freshwater supplies. Regional precipitation projections, however, differ largely between models, making future water resource projections highly uncertain. Using two representative concentration pathways and nine climate models, we estimate 21st century water resources across Australia, employing both a process-based dynamic vegetation model and a simple hydrological framework commonly used in water resource studies to separate the effects of climate and vegetation on water resources. Weshow surprisingly robust, pathway-independent regional patterns of change in water resources despite large uncertainties in precipitation projections. Increasing plant water use efficiency (due to the changing atmosphericCO(2)) and reduced green vegetation cover (due to the changing climate) relieve pressure on water resources for the highly populated, humid coastal regions of eastern Australia. By contrast, in semi-arid regions across Australia, runoff declines are amplified byCO(2)-induced greening, which leads to increased vegetation water use. These findings highlight the importance of including vegetation dynamics in future water resource projections."
1,"Background: This paper considers energy as a social and commercial determinant of health. Stable access to clean and sustainable energy is integral for human wellbeing yet public health rarely considers its importance.Methods: Using Nvivo qualitative analysis software we analysed all Australian federal, state and territory strategic energy policies covering varying periods between 2016-2030. We defined strategic policy as including the goals, objectives and strategies of the department regarding a specific area of policy responsibility. This criterion excluded documents such as operational guidelines. 36 energy-related policies were analyzed.Results: While the nature of energy supply is crucial to determining the impact of human and environmental health, our analysis showed that health and wellbeing are only rarely considered in policy. We developed a conceptual framework to guide our work linking energy policy with health. Australia's continued reliance on fossil fuels evident in the policies poses health risks, especially as climate change threatens physical and mental health. Yet health considerations were mainly absent from the policies. However, some jurisdictions (South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory) had policies encouraging a fast move to renewables. Energy pricing was a key focus in each jurisdiction and had become highly politicalized in the past decade. Little attention was paid to equity considerations in the policies.Conclusion: Energy policy would be more health promoting if public health perspectives were considered during its development. On the basis of our policy analysis and literature review we conclude with recommendations for healthy energy policy."
1,"Cropping system diversification is a key factor in developing more sustainable cropping and food systems. The agroecological practice of intercropping, meaning the simultaneous cultivation of two or more species in the same field, has recently gained renewed interest as a means of ecological intensification in European agricultural research. We discuss some recent research developments regarding 1) intercropping for ecological intensification in agroecological and conventional cropping systems, 2) studies on nitrogen resource use by cereal-grain legume intercropping cultivation, 3) the role of intercropping in the management of biotic stressors, especially weeds, and 4) intercropping as a means of creating cropping systems that are more resilient to the abiotic and biotic stress associated with climate change. Finally, we propose methods for the greater adoption of intercropping in European agriculture by unlocking farming systems from upstream and downstream barriers, with the aim of developing more sustainable agricultural and food systems."
1,"There are numerous geo-climatic and human factors that contribute to the occurrence of natural disasters in the real-world scenario. Besides the study of causes and preconditions of such calamities, post-disaster analysis is essential for the efficient management of the disaster situation. This process needs timely and accurate data in light of the increasing frequency and severity of climate change-related extreme weather events. The analysis of disaster data involves the challenging task of integrating multiple heterogeneous sources, data ingestion and visualization. This paper aims at providing a three-dimensional analytical view of disaster data as time-series charts and a statistical model to evaluate the correlation between the occurrence of disasters, climate change and the corresponding economic damages (as a percentage of GDP). The created corpus consists of two unified heterogeneous datasets. The first one forms the basis for exploratory data analysis involving visualization charts for disaster-related factors. The second dataset involves temperature anomaly information which allows for climate change analysis. The integration of the above datasets provides scope for correlation analysis using three different variations of coefficients. Therefore, statistical methodologies are leveraged to play important role in managing disasters, from preparation to recovery and reporting. The graphical representations provide insights on regional trends that follow, related to factors such as the proportion of each type of disaster in the various losses incurred. Therefore, obtaining reliable information about the population, the economy and climate are crucial both for risk management and preparedness and for responding to disasters. The research puts forth a detailed statistical methodology with a spatial dimension to study the impacts on the economy and infrastructure in the aftermath of a disaster thereby ensuring specialized assistance. The inference of the analysis confirmed a positive correlation between climate change and occurrence of natural disasters. Therefore, statistical evidence of an important phenomenon like climate change affecting natural disasters brings awareness among the population in the society to be more environmentally responsible."
1,"The positioning of federal fire brigades in the Brazilian Amazon is based on an oversimplified prediction of fire occurrences, where inaccuracies can affect the policy's efficiency. To mitigate this issue, this paper attempts to improve fire prediction. Firstly, a panel dataset was built at municipal level from socioeconomic and environmental data. The dataset is unparalleled in both the number of variables (48) and in geographical (whole Amazon) and temporal breadth (2008 to 2014). Secondly, econometric models were estimated to predict fire occurrences with high accuracy and to infer statistically significant predictors of fire. The best predictions were achieved by accounting for observed and unobserved time-invariant predictors and also for spatial dependence. The most accurate model predicted the top 20% municipal fire counts with 76% success rate. It was over twice as accurate in identifying priority municipalities as the current fire brigade allocation procedure. Of the 47 potential predictors, deforestation, forest degradation, primary forest, GDP, indigenous and protected areas, climate and soil proved statistically significant. Conclusively, the current criteria for allocating fire brigades should be expanded to account for (i) socioeconomic and environmental predictors, (ii) time-invariant unobservables and (iii) spatial auto-correlation on fires."
1,"Earth is currently undergoing a global increase in atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (VPD), a trend which is expected to continue as climate warms. This phenomenon has been associated with productivity decreases in ecosystems and yield penalties in crops, with these losses attributed to photosynthetic limitations arising from decreased stomatal conductance. Such VPD increases, however, have occurred over decades, which raises the possibility that stomatal acclimation to VPD plays an important role in determining plant productivity under high VPD. Furthermore, evidence points to more far-ranging and complex effects of elevated VPD on plant physiology, extending to the anatomical, biochemical, and developmental levels, which could vary substantially across species. Because these complex effects are typically not considered in modeling frameworks, we conducted a quantitative literature review documenting temperature-independent VPD effects on 112 species and 59 traits and physiological variables, in order to develop an integrated and mechanistic physiological framework. We found that VPD increase reduced yield and primary productivity, an effect that was partially mediated by stomatal acclimation, and also linked with changes in leaf anatomy, nutrient, and hormonal status. The productivity decrease was also associated with negative effects on reproductive development, and changes in architecture and growth rates that could decrease the evaporative surface or minimize embolism risk. Cross-species quantitative relationships were found between levels of VPD increase and trait responses, and we found differences across plant groups, indicating that future VPD impacts will depend on community assembly and crop functional diversity. Our analysis confirms predictions arising from the hydraulic corollary to Darcy's law, outlines a systemic physiological framework of plant responses to rising VPD, and provides recommendations for future research to better understand and mitigate VPD-mediated climate change effects on ecosystems and agro-systems."
0,"This article explores a form of knowledge politics played out within and between universities and research institutes as sites of certified disciplinary expertise in the agro-food domain. It investigates the openness of this domain to the expertise of the agro-food social sciences particularly when challenge-led research programmes require collaboration across disciplines. A case study is provided by the multi-discipline field of food security research in the UK involving interviews with key stakeholders. The article examines how this research fieldfield's disciplinary diversity is understood is understood by key stakeholders. Interview data are analysed thematically in terms of the current and potential contribution of social science disciplines, the different ways in which stakeholders imagine social science research, and whether social scientists themselves recognise and align with these different imaginaries. The article concludes by arguing that the field of food security research in the UK is open only selectively to agro-food social science knowledges and that this is likely to have negative implications for addressing the challenges of food security. Further, if the promise of collaborative working between disciplines in agro-food research fields is to be made good then the emphasis of agro-food knowledge politics scholarship and the governance of knowledge-making needs to change."
1,"Tree-dominated, forest gardens (FGs) are an ancient, tropical agricultural land use that farmers continue to practice and value. Knowing why farmers value FGs is important because this can increase livelihood security and the skillful governance of land. We chose Sri Lanka to investigate farmers' values for land, contextual factors that effect valuation, stressors that impact agriculture, and farmers' current and future response strategies. Mixed methods were used to collect data from 85 farming households in landholdings across nine locations of the Intermediate agroecological zone (1750-2500 mm). Landholdings comprise land uses with short-term, annual, and semi-perennial crops (paddy, swidden, and cash crop plots) and long-term, perennial or tree crops (FGs, plantations). Farmers' values were categorised, ranked, and aligned with Utility, Environmental, Aesthetic, Intrinsic, Option and Bequest themes of the Total Economic Value framework (TEV). Farmers give the highest importance to Utility (income, food) and Environmental (friendly biodiversity, leaf litter and soil fertility) values mainly from tree crops. Timber and fuelwood are biological assets that can be optionally converted to cash. Farmers have Intrinsic values (contentment, tranquility, pride) for land bequeathed to future generations. Nevertheless, since livelihoods are stressed by climate variability and extreme events, animal and insect pests, and labour scarcities, farmers adopt diverse response strategies. Of these, farmers favour long-term crop cultivation because trees are relatively resilient to droughts, floods, animal, and insect pests, and require less labour. This study validates why farmers' pluralistic values for land, trees, and biodiversity must be integrated into national decision-and policy-making for agriculture, forest and biodiversity conservation."
1,"Digital agriculture is an application of the digital earth concept proposed in the 1990s and is an expansion of the concept of precision farming which emphasizes on agricultural production procedures. A digital agricultural system is a database that includes not only various kinds of data relevant to agriculture, ranging from soil conditions to market assessment, but also optimal decision functions that help make best decisions in a series of agricultural production and marketing processes. Such a system is an important agricultural risk management tool, which can help assess risks due to climate change, develop a revenue protection plan for producers, and generate a soil quality management plan. This paper describes a structure that was originally proposed to the Canadian digital agriculture system: National Land and Water Information Service. The agroclimate database structure is described in detail, including data error estimation methods and guidance for generating optimal decision functions. The crop insurance under the future climate change scenarios require a strategic plan to deal with the altered tail probability distribution of the unfavourable weather events, such as drought, flooding, extreme wind, and extreme temperature. The digital agriculture system is an effective tool for insurance industry to use to develop a dynamical business plan for the changing climate. This paper includes two examples of the climate changes over Alberta Province, Canada, and over the contiguous United States for over 100 years. Alberta, six agroclimate parameters were considered for the period of 1901-2001. For the US, two warm periods in 1895-2008 were identified: the 1930s Dust Bowl drought and the recent warmth of the last two decades. The United States agriculture suffered a catastrophic loss in the Dust Bowl period. Because of the effective insurance plans and the critical governmental assistance, the agricultural loss due to drought and other disasters weather events in the last two decades was not catastrophic but still serious. Nine of the ten warmest winters according to the seasonal daily-minimum SAT and nine of the ten hottest years according the annual daily-mean SAT were in these two periods. The exception occurred during a short-lived period of anomalous warmth from 1953-1957. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B. V."
1,"Pomacea canaliculata is widely distributed in the Chinese provinces south of the Yangtze River, causing serious damage to aquatic ecosystems, rice cultivation, and human health. Predicting the potential geographic distributions (PGDs) of P. canaliculata under current and future climate conditions in China is crucial for developing effective early warning measures and facilitating long-term monitoring. In this study, we screened various species distribution models (SDMs), including CTA, GBM, GAM, RF, and XGBOOST, to construct an ensemble model (EM) and then predict suitable habitats for P. canaliculata under current and future climate scenarios (SSP1-26, SSP2-45, SSP3-70, SSP5-85). The EM (AUC = 0.99, TSS = 0.96) yielded predictions that were more precise than those from the individual models. The Annual Mean Temperature (Bio1) and Precipitation of the Warmest Quarter (Bio18) are the most significant environmental variables affecting the PGDs of P. canaliculata. Under current climate conditions, the highly suitable habitats for P. canaliculata are primarily located south of the Yangtze River, collectively accounting for 17.66% of the nation's total area. Unsuitable habitats predominate in higher-latitude regions, collectively covering 66.79% of China's total land area. In future climate scenarios, the total number of suitable habitats for P. canaliculata is projected to expand into higher latitude regions, especially under SSP3-70 and SSP5-85 climate conditions. The 4.1 degrees C contour of Bio1 and the 366 mm contour of Bio18 determine the northernmost geographical distribution of P. canaliculata. Climate change is likely to increase the risk of P. canaliculata expanding into higher latitudes."
0,"In the Amazon Basin, large-scale problems, such as deforestation, over-fishing, climate change and large hy-droelectric dams, are now recognized. However, many small-scale activities could exert significant cumulative, negative environmental impacts. We conducted a spatial analysis of small-scale dams used for hydropower and aquaculture in the central and southwestern portions of the Brazilian Amazon Basin. We found a very high density of small dams in these areas, and suggest that these dams, in the aggregate, are in fact pernicious because they are likely to have large impacts on the aquatic environment of these sub-basins in the Amazon. We recommend increasing the size and number of protected areas where dams are not allowed, and restricting the number of licenses for dams in order to reduce future intensification of their impacts."
1,"In an agrarian economy like Ghana, the need to understand climate change is as paramount as finding solutions to address the challenges of climate change. While a large body of literature has focused on exploring the impact of climate change, very few studies in Ghana have attempted to expand our knowledge on the extent of climate change across ecological zones in Ghana. This study used Ghana Meteorological Agency's climate data from 1989 to 2015, to assess the characteristics and trends of rainfall and temperature across the six ecological zones in Ghana. With the aid of descriptive statistics, Mann-Kendall test, linear regression, analysis of variance and posthoc comparison using Tukey HSD test, the study found increasing trend of temperature and decreasing rainfall across ecological zones and provided policy recommendations essential to offset the adverse impact of climate change particularly on agriculture."
0,"In recent decades, Malaysia has become one of the world's most urbanized nations, causing severe flash flooding. Urbanization should meet the population's needs by increasing the development of paved areas, which has significantly changed the catchment's hydrological and hydraulic characteristics. Therefore, the frequency of flash flooding in Malaysia's urban areas has grown year after year. Numerous techniques have been used, including the statistical approach, modeling, and storm design methods, in flood simulation. This research integrated hydrology and hydraulic models to simulate the urban flood events in the Aur River catchment. The primary objective is to determine water level and forecast peak flow based on hydrological assessment in the drainage system using XPSWMM software. The rainfall data for 60 min was used for this study in the hydrological analysis by obtaining an intensity-duration-frequency curve and peak flow value (Q peak). XPSWMM is used to simulate the response of a catchment to rainfall events in which runoff, water depth profile, and outflow hydrograph are obtained. Peak runoff is also obtained from the modified rational method for validation purposes. The proposed method was verified by comparing the result with the standard method. This is essential to identify flash flooding, which can lead to efficient flood mitigation planning and management in the urban catchment. The increase in residential areas results in the alteration of time of concentration, water quantity, and flow rate. Thus, to mitigate present and future problems, the effects of urbanization on water resources and flood should be analyzed."
1,"In a context of global warming characterized by a mean sea level rise and extreme meteorological events, the study of the causes for coastal flooding is essential to protect communities and ecosystems. Densely urbanized, and rather unprotected cities in developing countries such as the historic Saint Louis city in Senegal are particularly vulnerable to coastal flooding and sea hazards. From satellite-derived high resolution DEM and global ocean reanalyses, here we quantify the extreme coastal water level in order to identify the neighborhoods and places of particular socio-economical interest of Saint-Louis potentially vulnerable to flooding. The results reveal that the most severe levels have the potential to flood up to almost half of this low-lying river mouth plain. Social, economic and heritage stakes are exposed, and the artisanal fisherman district of Gueth Ndar, is particularly vulnerable to coastal flooding because of its low elevation and situation on the sand barrier. The co-occurrence of high tides and wave-induced runup contributes most to ECWL but they do not present a significant trend over the study period. The results show that over the period 1994-2015, potential flood risk increased by nearly one day per year, primarily due to sea level rise, sounding a warning signal to take countermeasures to protect communities and infrastructure."
1,"This hands-on lab allows students to explore concepts and quantify effects of ocean acidification. Many laboratory activities simplify ocean acidification through computer simulations or dripping acid on nonliving materials (e.g., sea shells) but do not provide adequate opportunities for students to measure, inquire, or see real consequences for living organisms. Thus, we developed this low-cost, easily accessible experiment to imitate ocean acidification on living, calcifying organisms."
1,"In this study, we assessed the impact of sea level rise, one of the most ascertained consequences of global climate change, for water levels in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD). We used a hydraulic model to compute water levels from August to November-when flooding is presently critical-under sea level rise scenarios of 20 cm (= Delta20) and 45 cm (= Delta45), respectively. The outputs show that the contour lines of water levels will be shifted up to 25 km (Delta20) and 50 km (Delta45) towards the sea due to higher sea levels. At the onset of the flood season ( August), the average increment in water levels in the Delta is 14.1 cm (Delta20) and 32.2 cm (Delta45), respectively. At the peak of the flood season ( October), high discharge from upstream attenuates the increment in water level, but average water level rise of 11.9 cm (Delta20) and 27.4 cm (Delta45), respectively, still imply a substantial aggravation of flooding problems in the VMD. GIS techniques were used to delineate areas with different levels of vulnerability, i.e., area with high (2.3 mio ha = 60% of the VMD), medium (0.6 mio ha = 15%) and low (1 mio ha = 25%) vulnerability due to sea level rise. Rice production will be affected through excessive flooding in the tidally inundated areas and longer flooding periods in the central part of the VMD. These adverse impacts could affect all three cropping seasons, Mua (main rainfed crop), Dong Xuan (Winter-Spring) and He Thu (Summer-Autumn) in the VMD unless preventive measures are taken."
1,"Climate change is a pervasive threat to biodiversity. While range shifts are a known consequence of climate warming contributing to regional community change, less is known about how species' positions shift within their climatic niches. Furthermore, whether the relative importance of different climatic variables prompting such shifts varies with changing climate remains unclear. Here we analysed four decades of data for 1,478 species of birds, mammals, butterflies, moths, plants and phytoplankton along a 1,200 km high latitudinal gradient. The relative importance of climatic drivers varied non-uniformly with progressing climate change. While species turnover among decades was limited, the relative position of species within their climatic niche shifted substantially. A greater proportion of species responded to climatic change at higher latitudes, where changes were stronger. These diverging climate imprints restructure a full biome, making it difficult to generalize biodiversity responses and raising concerns about ecosystem integrity in the face of accelerating climate change. The authors analyse four decades of distribution data for various taxonomic groups to understand the shift of species within their climatic niches and the changing influences of different climate factors. The diverse and diverging climate imprints raise concerns about future ecosystem integrity."
1,"1.In the Northern Hemisphere, an increase in both the frequency and magnitude of violent flooding events has been reported due to climate change. According to life history theory, one might postulate that in slow' species: (i) environmental canalisation may act as a selective force that minimises to some extent adult survival variations caused by catastrophic flood and (ii) extreme flooding events would cause important variations in recruitment and young survival. Hence, it may be hypothesised that (iii) the population growth rate of slow' species might be relatively insensitive to changes in the frequency of extreme climatic events if adult survival remains largely unaffected. 2.In this study, we investigated how extreme rainfall events resulting in severe flood impact population dynamics of a long-lived endangered amphibian, the yellow-bellied toad (Bombina variegata: Bombinatoridae). To address this issue, we used capture-recapture (CR) data collected on two populations (768 and 1154 individuals identified) in southern France and developed multi-event CR models. 3.Our results indicated that extreme flooding did not cause any variation in sub-adult or adult survival, whereas recruitment and juvenile survival were negatively impacted. Furthermore, our simulations indicated that the population growth rate was only marginally sensitive to potential changes in the frequency of extreme flooding in the future. 4.Hence, we suggest that extreme flooding does not appear to be a proximal factor of extinction risk for this endangered amphibian species."
1,"Fire regimes often vary at fine spatial scales in response to factors such as topography or fuels while climate usually synchronizes fires across broader scales. We investigated the relative influence of top-down and bottom-up controls on fire occurrence in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests in a highly fragmented landscape at Mount Dellenbaugh, in northwestern Arizona. Our study area of 4,000 ha was characterized by patches of ponderosa pine forest in drainages that were separated by a matrix of pinyon-juniper woodlands, sagebrush shrublands, and perennial grasslands. We reconstructed fire histories from 135 fire-scarred trees in sixteen 25-ha sample sites placed in patches of mature ponderosa forest. We found that, among patches of ponderosa forest, fires were similar in terms of frequency but highly asynchronous in terms of individual years. Climate synchronized fire but only across broader spatial scales. Fires occurring at broader scales were associated with dry years that were preceded by several wet years. The remarkable level of asynchrony at finer scales suggests that bottom-up factors, such as site productivity and fuel continuity, were important in regulating fire at Mount Dellenbaugh. Understanding where bottom-up controls were historically influential is important for prioritizing areas that may best respond to fuel treatment under a warming climate."
1,"Climate change is altering consumer- plant interactions in ecosystems worldwide. How consumers alter their spatial distribution, grazing activities, and functional morphology in response to climate stress can determine whether their effects on plants intensify or relax. Few studies have considered multiple consumer response metrics to elucidate the mechanisms underpinning the resulting changes in consumer- plant interactions. Here, we tested how drought stress influences the interaction between the dominant consumer, the fungal-farming periwinkle snail Littoraria irrorata, and a foundational plant, cordgrass Spartina alterniflora, in a southeastern US salt marsh. In a 4 mo field experiment, we maintained moderate snail densities in mesh control chambers and clear plastic climate chambers that simulated drought by elevating temperatures and drying soils. Monitoring revealed that snails more often congregated on cordgrass stems than leaves in climate chambers than in controls. Image analyses indicated that this behavioral shift corresponded to snails inflicting shorter, but more numerous, fungal-infested scars on cordgrass leaves, and causing less plant damage in climate chambers than controls. Coincident with their net reduction in grazing, snails maintained longer radulae, whose central teeth were blunter and lateral teeth were sharper, in climate chambers compared to controls. These results suggest that under drought, snail radulae may experience less frictional wear and that, at intermediate densities, snail-cordgrass interactions relax. Together with prior research showing that at high densities, snails can denude cordgrass during drought, we conclude that consumer density, behavior, and morphological responses must be integrated in predictions of how climate change will affect the direction, strength, and stability of consumer-plant interactions."
1,"Groundwater is a vital resource for freshwater supply during extended droughts and also a key storage governing drought propagation through the hydrological cycle. Current drought monitoring lacks large-scale estimates of groundwater droughts, but progress of country-to-global-scale models in the last years suggests that they could now be valuable tools to study and monitor water availability during extended droughts. As a prerequisite the models would need to be able to depict the diverse groundwater response to precipitation well enough to distinguish spatial differences. Here we developed a high-resolution transient groundwater model for Germany and tested its ability for representing the groundwater system dynamics with a focus on droughts. Validation of model results against streamflow-separated baseflow and groundwater head observation confirmed the model's ability to generally represent the groundwater head dynamics over 40 years with lower model performance in mountainous regions where model resolution was too low to capture local valley aquifers. The precipitation accumulation time that has the highest correlation with groundwater anomalies increases with hydraulic conductivity and specific yield from few months in the Central German Uplands to several years in the porous aquifers of northern Germany. Corresponding to these differences, distinct meteorological drought types led to different simulated groundwater reactions across Germany. Given the importance of groundwater as a resource, large-scale groundwater models are important tools for future studies on drought propagation as well as groundwater drought under climate change."
1,"Recent assessments from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) imply that global mean sea level is unlikely to rise more than about 1.1 m within this century but will increase further beyond 2100. Even within the most intensive future anthropogenic greenhouse gas emission scenarios, higher levels are assessed to be unlikely. However, some studies conclude that considerably greater sea level rise could be realized, and a number of experts assign a substantially higher likelihood of such a future. To understand this discrepancy, it would be useful to have scenario-independent metrics that can be compared between different approaches. The concept of a transient climate sensitivity has proven to be useful to compare the global mean temperature response of climate models to specific radiative forcing scenarios. Here, we introduce a similar metric for sea level response. By analyzing the mean rate of change in sea level (not sea level itself), we identify a nearly linear relationship with global mean surface temperature (and therefore accumulated carbon dioxide emissions) both in model projections and in observations on a century scale. This motivates us to define the transient sea level sensitivity as the increase in the sea level rate associated with a given warming in units of meters per century per kelvin. We find that future projections estimated on climate model responses fall below extrapolation based on recent observational records. This comparison suggests that the likely upper level of sea level projections in recent IPCC reports would be too low."
1,"Protected area systems and conservation corridors can help mitigate the impacts of climate change on Amazonian biodiversity. We propose conservation design criteria that will help species survive in situ or adjust range distributions in response to increased drought. The first priority is to protect the western Amazon, identified as the 'Core Amazon', due to stable rainfall regimes and macro-ecological phenomena that have led to the evolution of high levels of biodiversity. Ecotones can buffer the impact from climate change because populations are genetically adapted to climate extremes, particularly seasonality, because high levels of habitat diversity are associated with edaphic variability. Future climatic tension zones should be surveyed for geomorphological features that capture rain or conserve soil moisture to identify potential refugia for humid forest species. Conservation corridors should span environmental gradients to ensure that species can shift range distributions. Riparian corridors provide protection to both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Multiple potential altitudinal corridors exist in the Andes, but natural and anthropogenic bottlenecks will constrain the ability of species to shift their ranges and adapt to climate change. Planned infrastructure investments are a serious threat to the potential to consolidate corridors over the short and medium term."
1,"The Terminal Classic Period (AD 750-1000) collapse of lowland Maya social, economic, and political systems has been temporally correlated with severe and extended drought in regional paleoclimate records. Ancient Maya society also experienced a protracted multicentury drought earlier during the end of the Late Preclassic Period (AD 100-300). While some large Preclassic polities declined, many more flourished through the Early Classic. Why were the effects of the Terminal Classic drought more dramatic? What allowed some earlier Maya communities to be more resilient in the face of climate change? Accelerator mass spectrometry radiocarbon dating and stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses of human skeletal remains from 50 individuals at the ancient Maya community of Cahal Pech from this critical time period suggest that more diverse diets may have promoted resilience in the face of changing socioecological systems at the end of the Preclassic. During the Late Classic Period (AD 600-800), isotopic data indicate that high-status individuals had a narrow and highly specialized diet, which may have created a more vulnerable socioeconomic system that ultimately disintegrated as a result of anthropogenic landscape degradation and severe drought conditions during the Terminal Classic."
1,"Fleshy macroalgae may increase photosynthesis with greater CO2 availability under ocean acidification (OA) and outcompete calcifying macroalgae important for tropical reef accretion. Macroalgae use energy-dependent carbon concentrating mechanisms (CCMs) to take up HCO3-, the dominant inorganic carbon for marine photosynthesis, but carbon-use strategies may depend on the pCO(2), pH and irradiance. We examined photosynthesis in eight tropical macroalgae across a range of irradiances (0-1200 mu mol photon m(-2) s(-1)) pH levels (7.5-8.5) and CO2 concentrations (3-43 mu mol kg(-1)). Species-specific CCM strategies were assessed using inhibitors and delta C-13 isotope signatures. Our results indicate that the log of irradiance is a predictor of the photosynthetic response to elevated pCO(2)(R-2 > 0.95). All species utilized HCO3-, exhibited diverse C-use pathways and demonstrated facultative HCO3- use. All fleshy species had positive photosynthetic responses to OA, in contrast to a split amongst calcifiers. We suggest that shifts in photosynthetically-driven tropical macroalgal changes due to OA will most likely occur in moderate to high-irradiance environments when CCMs are ineffective at meeting the C-demands of photosynthesis. Further, facultative use of HCO3- allows greater access to CO2 for photosynthesis under OA conditions, particularly amongst fleshy macroalgae, which could contribute to enhance fleshy species dominance over calcifiers."
1,"The global decline in invertebrate diversity requires urgent conservation interventions. However, identifying priority conservation areas for invertebrates remains a significant challenge. We hypothesized that aligning the conservation of invertebrate biodiversity with climate change mitigation ofer offers a solution. As both soil carbon storage and invertebrate biodiversity are positively influenced by plant diversity and productivity, a positive correlation can also be expected between SOC and invertebrate biodiversity. Drawing on >10,000 invertebrate observations organized into functional groups, and site-specific soil organic Carbon (SOC) measurements from Patagonia, the Peruvian Andes, and montane tropical rainforest, we examined the role of climate, soil, topographical position and land use for prediction of invertebrate biodiversity. We found that taxonomic and functional invertebrate diversity and abundance closely correlate with SOC stocks within ecosystems. Topographical position of sites, which was partly associated with SOC, was also important, whereas land use was of subordinate importance. We conclude that recent advances in predicting and mapping SOC can guide the identification of habitats within landscapes with high biodiversity and conservation value for invertebrates. Our findings stress the importance of linking global climate change mitigation initiatives that aim to preserve and restore SOC to efforts aimed at improving the conservation of invertebrates and the ecosystem services they provide, for the realization of mutual climate and biodiversity benefits."
1,"Croplands, especially rice paddies, are important anthropogenic sources of methane (CH4) emission. Currently, the effects of extreme weather events, which are occurring more frequently with climate warming, on CH4 emissions from croplands still remain uncertain. In this study, we calibrated the CLM5BGC-Crop model and implemented it to nine cropland sites and global simulations, in order to a) analyze the spatial and temporal variations of CH4 emissions from different crop and climate types, b) identify corresponding environmental controlling factors, and c) investigate the effects of extreme weather events on CH4 emissions. The results show that parameterized CLM5BGC-Crop could simulate CH4 emissions from croplands well at both site and global scales. The simulated CH4 emissions from rice paddies (44.35 Tg CH4 yr(-1)) are 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than those from corn (0.38 Tg CH4 yr(- 1)) and wheat (2.57 Tg CH4 yr(- 1)) fields. Soil water content is the key factor affecting global CH4 emissions from croplands under present and future climate. Extreme high-temperature events occurring during the rice booting-flowering stage could reduce the CH4 emissions by 28%, while the CH4 emissions could be increased by 12-16% when extreme high-temperature events occurred during the rice milky-maturity stage. Extreme precipitation events increased CH4 emissions by 7% at the rice paddy site. At the global scale, extreme high temperature increased CH4 emissions from rice paddies by 8% at middle latitudes, in contrast, extreme high temperature reduced corresponding emissions by 12% at low latitudes, but the decrease in CH4 emissions from rice paddies at low latitudes will be reversed to a 9% increase in 2081-2100. Overall, the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events in future may lead to increased global CH4 emissions from croplands."
1,"Documenting geographic distribution and spatial linkages between CO2 sources and potential sinks in areas with significant levels of CO2 emissions is important when considering carbon-management strategies such as geologic sequestration or enhanced oil recovery (EOR). For example, the US Gulf Coast overlies a thick succession (> 6,000 m [> 20,000 ft]) of highly porous and permeable sandstone formations separated by thick, regionally extensive shale aquitards. The Gulf Coast and Permian Basin also have a large potential for EOR, in which CO2 injected into suitable oil reservoirs could be followed by long-term storage of CO2 in nonproductive formations below reservoir intervals. For example, > 6 billion barrels (Bbbl) of oil from 182 large reservoirs is technically recoverable in the Permian Basin as a result of miscible-CO2 flooding(.) The Gulf Coast also contains an additional 4.5 Bbbl of oil that could be produced by using miscible CO2. Although the CO2 pipeline infrastructure is well-developed in the Permian Basin, east Texas and the Texas Gulf Coast may have a greater long-term potential for deep, permanent storage of CO2 because of thick brine-bearing formations near both major subsurface and point sources of CO2."
0,"Over the last three decades, behavioural economics has been gaining ground in the research on a wide range of agriculture-related themes. This is due to the diversity of the agents involved in the production systems and the agro-food value chains in which opposing interests must be reconciled. The main objective of this study is to examine the dynamics of the research on the application of behavioural economics in agriculture across the world. To do this, a bibliometric analysis has been carried out through a literature review of the period between 1991 and 2020. The results of the study show that the use of behavioural economics has increased in the research on agriculture, particularly over the last five years. The application of behavioural economics in agriculture has focused on analysing consumers, producers, management, marketing, development, environmental issues, climate change, food and health."
1,"To improve the agricultural environment, utilization of biochar and organic materials from paddy fields gaining importance. This is because the long-term use of inorganic fertilizers aggravates the soil environment, and also because rice paddy is a major source of CH4 and N2O emissions during rice cultivation which involves continuous flooding. Recently, the application of organic materials and biochar to the soil has received increasing attention due to their potential benefits related to soil quality, crop growth, and greenhouse gas emission. This study examines the influence of biochar and straw treatments on rice growth, soil physicochemical properties, and global warming potential in the paddy field. Five treatments were applied for the study: control (Cn), inorganic fertilizer (IF), barley straw biochar (BC), barley straw (BS), and BC + BS. Soil quality after rice harvesting improved in the BC treated group. The yield components of rice were also improved in the BC + BS, compared to other treatments. These effects resulted in increased rice yield and uptake of nutrient contents in the BC + BS treatment. Total fluxes of CH4 and N2O relative to global warming significantly decreased by 37.3% and 65.2% in the BC + BS group than in the IF treatment, respectively. Consequentially, a cropping system with BC and BS is an effective strategy to improve rice productivity and soil quality and also reduce GHG emissions from paddy fields, thereby alleviating global warming."
1,"Jakarta is a capital city of Indonesia located in the delta of Ciliwung river. This city suffers annual flooding with some serious damage for certain extreme rainfall events, especially occurring at the upper parts of the Ciliwung watershed. In 1992 rainy season, flooding in Jakarta was scattered in 61 sites. In 1996, the flooding increased to 90 sites, and further increased in the rainy season of 2002 to be 159 sites. Jakarta experienced a major flooding on 9-10 February 2015 after having seen two occurrences of major flooding in the two preceding years 2013 and 2014 (Siswanto et al., 2017). Such extreme flooding events might become more frequent in the future due to the impacts of land use and climate change (Kure et al., 2014). To reduce the magnitude and frequency of further flooding, on-site as well as off-site program actions need to be taken comprehensively. This paper is specifically aimed at, firstly understanding the main problems causing flooding in the coastal area of Jakarta, and secondly proposing medium and long-term solutions from the perspective of an integrated watershed management approach. The proposed solution will also include institutional and financial arrangements in a cross-administrative boundary situation."
1,"More intense and frequent hurricanes may lead to long-lasting effects to tropical ecosystems. Here, we describe the immediate impact on the butterfly community of a lowland forest in Belize, following Hurricane Earl. Species richness and abundance increased posthurricane, likely driven by convergence of the organization between the canopy and understory communities. Resumen Los huracanes mas intensos y frecuentes pueden provocar efectos persistentes en los ecosistemas tropicales. Aqui describimos el impacto inmediato en la comunidad de mariposas de una selva de tierras bajas en Belice, posterior al huracan Earl.

1,"This study conducts a comprehensive analysis of hurricane trajectories and their variabilities in categories 1-5 over several decades for the North Atlantic Basin. Utilizing HURDAT2 data from 1961 to 2021, the analysis categorizes hurricanes based on the rate of pressure drop within a 6-h interval, revealing distinct patterns of intensification and weakening among different categories. The K-means clustering method synthesizes hurricane trajectories into representative paths, illustrating significant variations across decades. The research indicates that hurricanes in categories 1 and 2 predominantly originate from tropical depressions, with this trend slightly intensifying in categories 3 and 4. In contrast, Category 5 displayed variation, revealing an increased frequency in the subsequent decades. Additionally, the study analyzes the monthly distribution of hurricanes, identifying September as the peak month across all categories. The analysis further detects significant interannual variability with a noticeable intensification in hurricane activity since the 1990s, albeit with some reductions in the early 2010s. The Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) is used to summarize cyclonic activities, with results indicating a decrease from 1970 to 1995, followed by a consistent surge over the last 15 years. This aligns with previous research suggesting an approximately 60% increase in ACE since the 1980s. Furthermore, an analysis of North Atlantic Basin data reflects a progressive increase in the frequency of named storms (NS) and hurricanes, particularly from 1991 onwards. In conclusion, the study highlights not only an escalating frequency of hurricanes, but also increased variability and unpredictability, necessitating further research to comprehend the underlying causes and evaluate potential socioeconomic and environmental consequences."
1,"Biodiversity is the basis of human survival. Affected by the environment and climate change, the decrease in global biodiversity is becoming increasingly serious. Therefore, the study of regional biodiversity has great significance in protecting endangered species' habitat, planning and utilising the regional resources reasonably. Three dynamic habitat indices (DHI) of cumulative, minimum and difference were constructed by datasets of NDVI, EVI, FPAR, LAI and GPP of multispectral remote sensing vegetation products from 2002 to 2018. The multiple regression analysis was used to study (1) the applicability of DHIs constructed by different multispectral remote sensing indices (NDVI, EVI, FPAR, LAI and GPP); (2)the complementarity of species diversity expressed by cumulative, minimum and difference DHI models; (3)the impact of climate change on biodiversity in China; (4) the ability of cumulative, minimum and difference DHIs to express species richness. The research shows that (1) there is a strong correlation between corresponding DHIs based on the same MODIS multispectral vegetation indices (correlation coefficient from 0. 77 to 0. 98), so they can substitute for each other; There is a certain correlation among these three DHIs, while they cannot replace each other. (2)Compared with DHIs constructed by NDVI, EVI, FPAR and LAI product data, GPP-DHIs have the strongest ability to monitor biodiversity in China and have a good correlation with species richness (correlation coefficient from 0.32 to 0.84). (3) Continuous climate change will affect the total productivity of vegetation significantly in the large region, and extreme climate has little impact on the large region; Evapotranspiration has a more significant impact on the total productivity of vegetation in large - scale regions than temperature, and precipitation. (4) Environmental change has the greatest impact on amphibian species richness, followed by birds and mammals. (5) The cumulative DHI and minimum DHI in China gradually increase from the northwest inland to the southeast coastal area. The minimum DHI in the northwest, north China, high altitude area, high latitudes, and northwest desert areas are very small, which indicate the ecological environment in the southeast coastal area is more suitable for biological survival, and the harsh environment affects biodiversity seriously. The difference in DHI shows a higher spatial pattern in Northeast and North China, and a lower spatial pattern in Central and South China, which indicates that the living environment of species in Northeast and North China changed greatly, and the living environment of species in Central and South China was relatively stable."

1,"Biodiversity is in global decline during the Anthropocene. Declines have been caused by multiple factors, such as habitat removal, invasive species, and disease, which are often targets for conservation management. However, conservation interventions are under threat from climate change induced weather extremes. Weather extremes are becoming more frequent and devastating and an example of this was the 2019/2020 Australian drought and mega-fires. We provide a case study the impacts of these extreme weather events had on a population of the threatened frog Litoria aurea that occurs in a constructed habitat which was designed to reduce the impact of introduced fish and chytrid-induced disease. We aimed to determine what factors influenced persistence so that the design of wetlands can be further optimised to future-proof threatened amphibians. We achieved this with 4 years (2016-2020) of intensive capture-recapture surveys during austral spring and summer across nine wetlands (n = 94 repeat surveys). As hypothesized, drought caused a sharp reduction in population size, but persistence was achieved. The most parsimonious predictor of survival was an interaction between maximum air temperature and rainfall, indicating that weather extremes likely caused the decline. Survival was positively correlated with wetland vegetation coverage, positing this is an important feature to target to enhance resilience in wetland restoration programs. Additionally, the benefits obtained from measures to reduce chytrid prevalence were not compromised during drought, as there was a positive correlation between salinity and survival. We emphasize that many species may not be able to persist under worse extreme weather scenarios. Despite the potential for habitat augmentation to buffer effects of extreme weather, global action on climate change is needed to reduce extinction risk."
1,"This final paper in the Special Issue on Latin America summarizes the contributions of the 15 previous and more specialized papers under the themes of 1) defining characteristics of Latin American forestry and its comparison with forestry in other parts of the world, 2) policies that make a difference specifically for Latin America and 3) Latin America's developing forest industry. We observe, in particular, the region's position within Mather's wellknown Forest Transition and what this suggests for the future of Latin American forest development and for the important effect of aggregate economic development on forest use, for agriculture's role in deforestation and policies to control it, and for the need for more information about the forest industry and its impact on forestdependent human communities and on the forest itself. More or better information about each of these themes would lend confidence to our findings. More importantly, it would enable improved market and policy adjustments for the large changes that we anticipate both economic development and global climate change will bring to Latin America's forests and forest sector in the years ahead. Finally, we finish by noting the rapidly growing demands for non-consumptive uses of Latin America's forests and the importance of information about those as well."
1,"Climate change and its social, environmental, economic and ethical consequences are widely recognized as the major set of interconnected problems facing human societies. Its impacts and costs will be large, serious, and unevenly spread, globally for decades. The main factor causing climate change and global warming is the increase of global carbon emissions produced by human activities such as deforestation and burning of fossil fuels. In this special volume, the articles mainly focus on investigations of technical innovations and policy interventions for improved energy efficiency and carbon emissions reduction in a wide diversity of industrial, construction and agricultural sectors at different scales, from the smallest scales (firm or household), cities, regional, to national and global scales. Some articles in this special volume assess alternative carbon emissions reduction approaches, such as carbon capture and storage and geoengineering schemes. Given the high cost and internal/external uncertainties of carbon capture and storage and risks and side effects of various geoengineering schemes, improved energy efficiency and widespread implementation of low fossil-carbon renewable-energy based systems are clearly the most direct and effective approaches to reduce carbon emissions. This means that we have to radically transform our societal metabolism towards low/no fossil-carbon economies. However, design and implementation of low/no fossil-carbon production will require fundamental changes in the design, production and use of products and these needed changes are evolving but much more needs to be done. Additionally, the design and timing of suitable climate policy interventions, such as various carbon taxation/trading schemes, must be integral in facilitating the development of low fossil carbon products and accelerating the transition to post-fossil carbon societies.

1,"Aim To review the insights that palaeoecology can offer on the threat posed to Andean communities by global climate change. Location The geographical focus is the eastern flank of the tropical Andes, with particular reference to Peru. Method The article presents a synthetic review of the problem. Results Species-rich communities of the eastern Andean flank are threatened both by development and climate change. If, as predicted, the cloudbase and frost line lifts 600 in elevation this century, there will be a substantial loss of cloud forest habitat. Palaeoecology provides insights on the location and nature of past ecotones, the continuity of niche availability, and estimates for rates and modes of migration. With further warming and drying of lower montane regions, upslope migration of species will be individualistic: a new equilibrium with the altered climate is unlikely to be attained. The zone of agriculture will move upslope faster than the migrating trees and so landscape conversion will negate the ability of some species to respond to the new conditions. Conservation of the lower reaches of modern cloud forest is advocated as a means to limit this foreseeable extinction event. Main Conclusions Climate change will induce changes in plant and animal communities. Human disturbance will invade climatically marginal agricultural lands at the pace of climate change. Rapid migratory response such as that witnessed at the onset of the Holocene may not be evident as climates warm, because Holocene climatic stability has reduced outlying upslope populations that may have served as expansion nuclei. Conservation must aim to maintain plant and animal niches, rather than particular communities of species."
1,"Nepal, a Himalayan country, is often chosen by global scientists to study climate change and its impact on the Himalayan environment. The changes in temperature, precipitation, glaciers, and glacial lakes over Nepal are comprehensively reviewed based on published literature and compared with regional studies. Furthermore, the published glacier datasets were used to calculate and analyze the changes in area, equilibrium line of altitude (ELA) and ice reserves to show the response of glaciers to climate change. We find that the warming trend (0.02 to 0.16 degrees C yr-1) is being more pronounced over Nepal, and heterogeneous changes in precipitation amount, pattern, and frequency are observed with no significant trend. Concurrently, the glaciers are found to be responding with heterogeneous shrinkage in area (- 1 to - 5 km(2) yr(-1)), possessing negative mass balance (- 0.3 to - 0.8 m w.e. yr(-1)), decrease in ice volume (- 4.29 km(3) yr(-1)) and upward shift of the ELA (similar to 20.66 m decade(-1)). The total decrease in ice reserve (- 128.84 km(3)) of Nepal has resulted in similar to 0.32 mm of sea level rise in past 30 years. Moreover, the formation and surface area expansion (0.83 % yr(-1)) of glacial lakes over Nepal have been accelerated. Additionally, we note that Nepal is highly susceptible to glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) events and document a total of 45 reliable reported and unreported historical GLOF events from 39 glacial lakes across Nepal. This review will facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the current state of climate change and the identification of existing knowledge gaps in Nepal."
1,"Climate change is a complex environmental problem that is adversely affecting the different sectors of the economy in both developed and developing world. Malaysia is experiencing rapid changes in climate factors over the past few decades. The mean surface temperature for Malaysia increased with the ranges from 0.6 degrees C to 1.2 degrees C during the period of 40 years (1969-2009). It was projected that the surface temperature would increase from 1.5 degrees C to 2.0 degrees C by 2050. Rainfall and river flows are projected to experience greater fluctuations. Changes in climate factors are likely to affect adversely the agriculture production and consequently food security of the country. This paper aims to focus on the potential threats and effects of climate change on agriculture and food security in Malaysia. The paper reviews currently available information on climate change, agriculture and food security issues in Malaysia. Available literatures demonstrate the potential threat of climate change to the production of grains and export earnings from industrial products. It was reported that changes in climate factors could decrease yields of rice, the main staple food in Malaysia, from 13% to 80%. On the other hand, production of industrial crops, particularly oil palm, rubber and cocoa would decline with a range of 10-30% due to negative impacts of climate variability. Moreover, population of the country is expected to increase in the next few decades which will cause increased domestic demand of food. The country would require to increase significantly the production of food commodities in order to meet increased domestic demand of food. However, it is unlikely that a significant increase in food production will be achieved in the short to medium term due to the limited resources in agriculture sector. This might cause the risk of food crises and consequently threaten food security in the country. Therefore, urgent action is very much needed to preserve agriculture sector and sustain production of food in the face of inevitable climate change."
0,"Global warming has escalated the frequency of extreme climate events. Considering the escalating severity of air pollution, investigating its potential to cause operational problems is of value. Some studies have explored air pollution's effects from individual perspectives, including emotions, attitudes, and decision-making behaviors. Yet, the influence of heavy haze weather on firm performance from an operations management viewpoint remains uninvestigated. This study seeks to address this research gap. Utilizing a longitudinal dataset from 2255 manufacturing firms between 2014 and 2020, this study empirically examines heavy haze weather's impact on operational efficiency. Three contingency categories are identified: strategic positioning, structural contingency, and institutional factors. The findings suggest that heavy haze weather adversely impacts operational efficiency, notably for firms with cost leadership strategies and high labor productivity, whereas such effect can weaken in the firms with process standardization and governmental environment inspection. Enhancing the understanding about the effect of heavy haze weather on operational performance, these findings offer strategic insights for firms to mitigate heavy haze weather and provide empirical support for government to make environmental policymaking."
1,"The Mekong River, which has high economic and ecological importance, has an extensive floodplain and delta plain that extends from Cambodia to Vietnam. Understanding the Holocene evolution of the fluvial system is needed in order to predict the future development of the system and develop a strategy to guide the sustainable management. This paper reconstructs the Holocene sedimentary evolution of the Mekong River floodplain, Cambodia, from 12 auger cores and 69 optically stimulated luminescence ages, and compares the reconstructed floodplain history with that of other large river systems. Rapid deposition of thick crevasse splays implies floodplain aggradation in response to sea-level rise before 6.5 ka. After 6.5 ka, when the sea-level reached a stillstand, the rapid aggradation ceased and levee and crevasse-splay deposition were localized near the anastomosing river channels. The rate of levee accretion was very low in the anastomosing river system (<1 m/kyr), which implies that the riverbed aggradation caused by sea-level rise before 6.5 ka outpaced levee accretion and led to avulsion by diversion into the floodbasin. Some distributary channels were abandoned around 4 ka, corresponding to a shift from an anastomosing to a single-channel river system. This shift might be attributed to an abrupt decrease in precipitation caused by weakening of the East Asian and Indian summer monsoons. Downstream of Phnom Penh, rapid levee deposition started on the uppermost delta plain after 1 ka while rapid lateral migration of the river channel occurred upstream. These increased fluvial activities correspond to accelerated mud accretion of the Mekong delta coast and potentially reflect an increase in sediment supply caused by human activities. The evolution of the Mekong River floodplain might be comparable with other large river systems in the EASM, ISM, and African monsoon regions, where a substantial weakening of the summer monsoon and hence a decrease in precipitation occurred in response to declining summer insolation in the middle to late Holocene.

1,"The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (Jingjinji) region is the most densely populated region in China and suffers from severe water resource shortage, with considerable water-related issues emerging under a changing context such as construction of water diversion projects (WDP), regional synergistic development, and climate change. To this end, this paper develops a framework to examine the water resource security for 200 counties in the Jingjinji region under these changes. Thus, county-level water resource security is assessed in terms of the long-term annual mean and selected typical years (i.e., dry, normal, and wet years), with and without the WDP, and under the current and projected future (i.e., regional synergistic development and climate change). The outcomes of such scenarios are assessed based on two water-crowding indicators, two use-to-availability indicators, and one composite indicator. Results indicate first that the water resources are distributed unevenly, relatively more abundant in the northeastern counties and extremely limited in the other counties. The water resources are very limited at the regional level, with the water availability per capita and per unit gross domestic product (GDP) being only 279/290 m(3) and 46/18 m(3) in the current and projected future scenarios, respectively, even when considering the WDP. Second, the population carrying capacity is currently the dominant influence, while economic development will be the controlling factor in the future for most middle and southern counties. This suggests that significant improvement in water-saving technologies, vigorous replacement of industries from high to low water consumption, as well as water from other supplies for large-scale applications are greatly needed. Third, the research identifies those counties most at risk to water scarcity and shows that most of them can be greatly relieved after supplementation by the planned WDP. Finally, more attention should be paid to the southern counties because their water resources are not only limited but also much more sensitive and vulnerable to climate change. This work should benefit water resource management and allocation decisions in the Jingjinji region, and the proposed assessment framework can be applied to other similar problems."
0,"Disappearing islands and climate refugees have become signifiers of the scale and urgency of uneven impacts of climate change. This paper offers a critical account of how sea level rise debates reverberate around Western mythologies of island laboratories. I argue that representations of low-lying Oceania islands as experimental spaces burden these sites with providing proof of a global climate change crisis. The emergence of Tuvalu as a climate change 'canary' has inscribed its islands as a location where developed world anxieties about global climate change are articulated. As Tuvalu islands and Tuvaluan bodies become sites to concretize climate science's statistical abstractions, they can enforce an eco-colonial gaze on Tuvalu and its inhabitants. Expressions of 'wishful sinking' create a problematic moral geography in some prominent environmentalist narratives: only after they disappear are the islands useful as an absolute truth of the urgency of climate change, and thus a prompt to save the rest of the planet."
1,"Scenarios modeling can be a useful tool to plan for climate change. In this study, we help Everglades restoration planning to bolster climate change resiliency by simulating plausible ecosystem responses to three climate change scenarios: a Baseline scenario of 2010 climate, and two scenarios that both included 1.5 degrees C warming and 7% increase in evapotranspiration, and differed only by rainfall: either increase or decrease by 10%. In conjunction with output from a water-use management model, we used these scenarios to drive the Everglades Landscape Model to simulate changes in a suite of parameters that include both hydrologic drivers and changes to soil pattern and process. In this paper we focus on the freshwater wetlands; sea level rise is specifically addressed in prior work. The decreased rainfall scenario produced marked changes across the system in comparison to the Baseline scenario. Most notably, muck fire risk was elevated for 49% of the period of simulation in one of the three indicator regions. Surface water flow velocity slowed drastically across most of the system, which may impair soil processes related to maintaining landscape patterning. Due to lower flow volumes, this scenario produced decreases in parameters related to flow-loading, such as phosphorus accumulation in the soil, and methylmercury production risk. The increased rainfall scenario was hydrologically similar to the Baseline scenario due to existing water management rules. A key change was phosphorus accumulation in the soil, an effect of flow-loading due to higher inflow from water control structures in this scenario."
1,"The cool season (November-March) of 2022-2023 was exceptional in the western United States (US), with the highest precipitation totals in >= 128 years in some areas. Recent precipitation extremes and expectations based on thermodynamics motivate us to evaluate the evidence for an anthropogenic intensification of western US cool-season precipitation to date. Over cool seasons 1951-2023, trends in precipitation totals on the wettest cool-season days were neutral or negative across the western US, and significantly negative in northern California and parts of the Pacific Northwest, counter to the expected net intensification effect from anthropogenic forcing. Multiple reanalysis data sets indicate a corresponding lack of increase in moisture transports into the western US, suggesting that atmospheric circulation trends over the North Pacific have counteracted the increases in atmospheric moisture expected from warming alone. The lack of precipitation intensification to date is generally consistent with climate model simulations. A large ensemble of 648 simulations from 35 climate models suggests it is too soon to detect anthropogenic intensification of precipitation across much of the western US. In California, the 35-model median time of emergence for intensification of the wettest days is 2080 under a mid-level emissions scenario. On the other hand, observed reductions of precipitation extremes in California and the Pacific Northwest are near the lower edge of the large ensemble of simulated trends, calling into question model representation of western US precipitation variability. After warming, one of the best understood climate responses to greenhouse gasses is increased atmospheric moisture (from more evaporation) and resultant storm intensification. Given that hydrological infrastructure and policies are probably more attuned to past climate than future climate, intensified precipitation has important implications for management of flood hazards and water resources. In the western US, the very wet winter of 2023 and the extensive flooding that resulted indicated that this region may be highly vulnerable to increases in precipitation extremes. Are precipitation extremes already intensifying in the western US? We find no evidence for intensified western US winter precipitation thus far. In fact, precipitation intensity actually decreased in northern California and the Pacific Northwest over 1951-2023. In California, most climate models do not project intensified precipitation to become detectable from that region's wide range of natural variability until the 2060s even under heavy greenhouse-gas emissions. By the end of this century, however, most climate models consistently project the strongest storms to be stronger than they were historically across most or all of the western US. Thus, the lack of precipitation intensification thus far should not dissuade planning for greater precipitation intensity and flood risks. Over 1951-2023, precipitation on the wettest cool-season days did not increase across most of the western US, and even declined in areas In California, most climate models do not project human-caused precipitation intensification to become detectable before the 2060s Climate models rarely simulate precipitation intensity to decline as much as it did in northern California and the Pacific Northwest"
0,"Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) in legume crops is a crucial ecosystem service that enhances soil nitrogen and reduces the need for chemical fertilisers. This study evaluates the factors influencing the proportion of plant nitrogen derived from atmospheric fixation (Ndfa) in legume crops. We compiled a global dataset spanning from 1980 to 2018 and used the 15N method to assess the impacts of crop species, climatic conditions, stand composition and nitrogen fertilisation on Ndfa. The global meta-analysis reveals that the percentage of nitrogen derived from atmospheric fixation (Ndfa) in legumes ranges from 5% to 99%, with an average of 68%. Fodder legumes exhibited higher Ndfa, averaging 75%, while grain legumes showed more variability, ranging from 38% to 85%, depending on species and climatic conditions. The significant variability in Ndfa underscores the complexity of the process, which is influenced by species-specific traits, ecological conditions and competition in mixed stands. However, the current data is insufficient for precise Ndfa estimation in nitrogen balances and decision support tools. The study highlights the need for further research on the impact of nitrogen fertilisation and stand composition on Ndfa. These findings emphasise the potential of BNF to support sustainable agriculture by improving nitrogen availability and reducing dependence on synthetic fertilisers and particularly susceptibility to climate change challenges. To optimise the benefits of BNF, future research should focus on refining fertilisation regimes and exploring species-specific responses to various ecological conditions. Exploring adaptive strategies, like selecting drought-tolerant legumes and optimising irrigation, is essential. This will enhance the application of BNF in diverse agricultural systems, contributing to more sustainable and efficient farming practices."
1,"We analyse how climate change may alter risks posed by droughts to carbon fluxes in European ecosystems. The approach follows a recently proposed framework for risk analysis based on probability theory. In this approach, risk is quantified as the product of hazard probability and ecosystem vulnerability. The probability of a drought hazard is calculated here from the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). Vulnerability is calculated from the response to drought simulated by process-based vegetation models. We use six different models: three for generic vegetation (JSBACH, LPJmL, ORCHIDEE) and three for specific ecosystems (Scots pine forests: BASFOR; winter wheat fields: EPIC; grasslands: PASIM). The periods 1971-2000 and 2071-2100 are compared. Climate data are based on gridded observations and on output from the regional climate model REMO using the SRES A1B scenario. The risk analysis is carried out for similar to 18 000 grid cells of 0.25 x 0.25 degrees across Europe. For each grid cell, drought vulnerability and risk are quantified for five seasonal variables: net primary and ecosystem productivity (NPP, NEP), heterotrophic respiration (Rh), soil water content and evapotranspiration. In this analysis, climate change leads to increased drought risks for net primary productivity in the Mediterranean area: five of the models estimate that risk will exceed 15 %. The risks increase mainly because of greater drought probability; ecosystem vulnerability will increase to a lesser extent. Because NPP will be affected more than Rh, future carbon sequestration (NEP) will also be at risk predominantly in southern Europe, with risks exceeding 0.25 g Cm-2 d(-1) according to most models, amounting to reductions in carbon sequestration of 20 to 80 %."

0,"The coming 10-20 years will be most critical for making the transition to a global food system in which mineral nutrients in agriculture must be managed in a more holistic manner. Fertilizers play a particular role in that because they are among the key drivers for securing global food security and improving human nutrition through increased crop yields and nutritional quality. A new paradigm for responsible plant nutrition follows a food systems and circular economy approach to achieve multiple socioeconomic, environmental and health objectives. Achieving that requires utilizing all available organic and inorganic nutrient sources with high efficiency, tailored to the specific features of food systems and agroecosystems in different world regions. Critical actions include: (i) sustainability-driven nutrient roadmaps, (ii) digital crop nutrition solutions, (iii) nutritious crops, (iv) nutrient recovery and recycling, (v) climate-smart fertilizers, and (vi) accelerated innovation. The outcome of this transformation will be a new societal plant nutrition optimum rather than a purely economic optimum. New partnerships and sustainability-focused business models will create added value for all actors in the nutrient chain and benefit farmers as well as consumers. Research needs to become more problem-driven and merge excellent science with entrepreneurial innovation approaches in order to develop robust solutions faster and at larger scale. Evidence-based policies should focus on creating and supporting the necessary nutrient stewardship roadmaps, including realistic national targets, progressive regulation and incentives that support technology and business innovation."
1,"Bangladesh, one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change, is threatened by sea level rise (SLR) and land subsidence. The tidal river management (TRM) practised in coastal regions of Bangladesh has the potential to raise the land by sedimentation, to counteract SLR and subsidence. TRM is an indigenous method in which dikes are breached to readmit sediment-rich water into a polder, which results in sediment being deposited in depressions in the polder called 'bee's', while simultaneously preventing silting-up of the tidal rivers. However, after several years of continuous sedimentation from TRM, deposition has been uneven and less than expected. To study the effectiveness of TRM, this research analyses different scenarios to identify which operation schemes most effectively trap sediment to raise the land surface. The scenarios developed considered the number of inlets, flow regulation through the beel using open inlets or gated inlets with different operation schemes, and seasonally. The study area was Pakhimara Beel in southwest Bangladesh, where TRM is ongoing. To simulate the scenarios, a two-dimensional (2D) morphodynamic model with variable cell size was set up, calibrated and used. The simulation results were analysed for total sediment deposition, uniformly of spatial distribution of sediment deposition and trapping efficiency. Sediment deposition shows clear seasonal variability, with greatest deposition in the pre-monsoon period, less during monsoon and least in the dry season. Greatest deposition combined with high spatial uniformly was found for TRM that uses two inlets located at opposite sides connected to different watercourses. Regulated flow using successively opened gates resulted in highest sediment deposition in all seasons, about double that of the existing situation without gate. However, given the complexly and cost of gate operation, TRM with two inlets located at opposite sides of the beel without flow regulation may be considered more feasible, and still effective despite 20-30% less sediment deposition. To also increase acceptability by local affected stakeholders we propose to restrict this improved TRM to the monsoon period, to allow crops to be grown on the land in the dry and pre-monsoon periods, and ensure salinity is minimized. Such well-planned TRM has the potential to also counteract sea level rise in sinking deltas elsewhere in the world by enhancing sedimentation."
0,"In recent decades, land use/cover change (LUCC) due to urbanization, deforestation, and desertification has dramatically increased, which changes the global landscape and increases the pressure on the environment. LUCC not only accelerates global warming but also causes widespread and irreversible loss of biodiversity. Therefore, LUCC reconstruction has important scientific and practical value for studying environmental and ecological changes. The commonly used LUCC reconstruction models can no longer meet the growing demand for uniform and high-resolution LUCC reconstructions. In view of this circumstance, a deep learning-integrated LUCC reconstruction model (DLURM) was developed in this study. Zhenlai County of Jilin Province (1986-2013) was taken as an example to verify the proposed DLURM. The average accuracy of the DLURM reached 92.87% (compared with the results of manual interpretation). Compared with the results of traditional models, the DLURM had significantly better accuracy and robustness. In addition, the simulation results generated by the DLURM could match the actual land use (LU) map better than those generated by other models."

1,"Estimating the impacts of climate change on groundwater represents one of the most difficult challenges faced by water resources specialists. One difficulty is that simplifying the representation of the hydrological system often leads to discrepancies in projections. This study provides an improved methodology for the estimation of the impacts of climate change on groundwater reserves, where a physically-based surface-subsurface flow model is combined with advanced climate change scenarios for the Geer basin (465 km(2)), Belgium. Coupled surface-subsurface flow is simulated with the finite element model HydroGeoSphere. The simultaneous solution of surface and subsurface flow equations in HydroGeoSphere, as well as the internal calculation of the actual evapotranspiration as a function of the soil moisture at each node of the defined evaporative zone, improve the representation of interdependent processes like recharge, which is crucial in the context of climate change. More simple models or externally coupled models do not provide the same level of realism. Fully-integrated surface-subsurface flow models have recently gained attention, but have not been used in the context of climate change impact studies. Climate change simulations were obtained from six regional climate model (RCM) scenarios assuming the SIZES A2 emission (medium-high) scenario. These RCM scenarios were downscaled using a quantile mapping bias-correction technique that, rather than applying a correction only to the mean, forces the probability distributions of the control simulations of daily temperature and precipitation to match the observed distributions. The same corrections are then applied to RCM scenarios for the future. Climate change scenarios predict hotter and drier summer and warmer and wetter winters. The combined use of an integrated surface-subsurface modelling approach, a spatial representation of the evapotranspiration processes and sophisticated climate change scenarios improves the model realism and projections of climate change impacts on groundwater reserves. For the climatic scenarios considered, the integrated flow simulations show that significant decreases are expected in the groundwater levels (up to 8 m) and in the surface water flow rates (between 9% and 33%) by 2080.

0,"There is an urgent need for adaptive supply chain strategies that can mitigate the effects of climate change on the agricultural system. This study introduces a new mathematical model, Capacitated Facility Location Problems with Multi-Period (CFLP-MP), to respond to this challenge. Unlike existing models, the CFLP-MP framework is designed to optimize the supply chain system design of facility locations and transportation routes by accommodating changes in production and demand for multiple time periods. The proposed model can be extended to other time-sensitive agricultural foods, but in this research, it is applied to the U.S. apple industry as a case study. Despite varying conditions, the model demonstrates resilience in maintaining its operational efficiency, thereby offering a solution to the initial challenge of creating an adaptive agricultural supply chain system. In conclusion, this research offers a versatile toolset for enhancing resilience and sustainability in fruit crop production, precisely addressing the climate-induced challenges identified above."
1,"Hydrological droughts occur due to a variety of hydrometeorological phenomena, such as a lack of precipitation, reduced snow cover, and high evaporation. The values of these factors vary depending on the climate and the severity of drought events. Droughts caused by a lack of precipitation and continuing in the warm season have a longer periodicity. This important statement raises the question of whether climate change may exacerbate the phenomenon of drought. Therefore, understanding the changes in the formation of hydrological droughts is key to foreseeing possible changes in the future. This scientific study analyses the spread of hydrometeorological droughts in the Ile-Balkash basin using standardized precipitation indices and the drought index of river runoff. Lake Balkash plays an important role in the hydrological cycle and is a valuable freshwater resource, especially in dry years. Prolonged droughts in the area have serious consequences, such as deterioration of water quality and loss of wetlands, which are important to the ecological system and migratory birds. The analysis shows that during the period of instrumental observations, several extreme hydrological droughts were observed in this area (1943-1946, 1973-1975, and 1983-1987), which emphasizes the relevance and importance of scientific research on the problem of drought."
0,"With the galloping progress of the changing climates all around the world, Machine Learning (ML) approaches have been prevalently studied in many types of research in this area. ML is a robust tool for acquiring perspectives from data. In this paper, we elaborate on climate change mitigation issues and ML approaches leveraged to solve these issues and aid in the improvement and function of sustainable energy systems. ML has been employed in multiple applications and many scopes of climate subjects such as ecosystems, agriculture, buildings and cities, industry, and transportation. So, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is applied to explore and evaluate findings from related research. In this paper, we propose a novel taxonomy of Deep Learning (DL) method applications for climate change mitigation, a comprehensive analysis that has not been conducted before. We evaluated these methods based on critical parameters such as accuracy, scalability, and interpretability and quantitatively compared their results. This analysis provides new insights into the effectiveness and reliability of DL methods in addressing climate change challenges. We classified climate change ML methods into six key customizable groups: ecosystems, industry, buildings and cities, transportation, agriculture, and hybrid applications. Afterward, state-of-the-art research on ML mechanisms and applications for climate change mitigation issues has been highlighted. In addition, many problems and issues related to ML implementation for climate change have been mapped, which are predicted to stimulate more researchers to manage the future disastrous effects of climate change. Based on the findings, most of the papers utilized Python as the most common simulation environment 38.5 % of the time. In addition, most of the methods were analyzed and evaluated in terms of some parameters, namely accuracy, latency, adaptability, and scalability, respectively. Lastly, classification is the most frequent ML task within climate change mitigation, accounting for 40 % of the total. Furthermore, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are the most widely utilized approach for a variety of applications."
1,"Climate change is expected to alter the distribution and abundance of many species. Predictions of climate-induced population extinctions are supported by geographic range shifts that correspond to climatic warming, but few extinctions have been linked mechanistically to climate change. Here we show that extinctions of two populations of a checkerspot butterfly were hastened by increasing variability in precipitation, a phenomenon predicted by global climate models. We model checkerspot populations to show that changes in precipitation amplified population fluctuations, leading to rapid extinctions. As populations of checkerspots and other species become further isolated by habitat loss, climate change is likely to cause more extinctions, threatening both species diversity and critical ecosystem services."
1,"Biodiversity loss caused by housing is not a well-defined sector of environmental impact. This research quantifies effects on biodiversity of an average Spanish Single-Family House (SFH) with 180 m2 of built surface. The current Spanish SFH stock GWP amounts to 1.16 Gt CO2eq in a 50-year life cycle, 40 % of which is embodied in the building materials and the 60 % are emissions due to the use of the building. This stock also impacts with 10.2 Gt 1,4-DCB the land, water and human health. SFHs also drive 6052 species extinct in a 50 year life cycle, and account for 3.03 M years of life lost due to premature death or lived with a disability. Divided by the 16 M people living in Spanish SFHs, each one lost 0.19 years of their lives (68.1 days) due to their home's impacts on human health. The article compares a reference conventional building against three low-impact cases, to understand how different building techniques and materials influence environmental outcomes that keep biodiversity loss the lowest possible. Scenarios include a standard brick and concrete house as Scenario 0 (SC0, Base), a timber Passivhaus as Scenario 1 (SC1), a straw-bale house with renewable energies as Scenario 2 (SC2), and an earth bioclimatic house as Scenario 3 (SC3). An initial Global Warming Potential (GWP) analysis was performed to relate previous building Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies with biodiversity metrics. Three main biodiversity metrics; ecotoxicity (as midpoint indicator), biodiversity loss and damage to human health (both as endpoint indicators) have been considered. Compared to SC0 with 1292 kgCO2-eq center dot m- 2 (516 embodied) of GWP, we found that SC1 emitted-47.0 % of that, SC2-41.4 % and SC3-80.9 %. Concerning ecotoxicity, where SC0 has 11,399 kg 1,4 DCB, the results are-27.9 % in SC1,-19.2 % in SC2, and-45.6 % in SC3. Regarding biodiversity loss, where SC0 has 7.54 E-06 species.yr center dot m- 2, the impacts are-30.9 % in SC1,-32.6 % in SC2, and-58.6 % in SC3.Human health damage in SC0 being 3.37 E-03 DALY, has been reduced in the timber home (SC1) is-44.2 %, of the Straw SFH (SC2)-39.2 %, and of the earth house (SC3)-67.1 %. This article shows that with current existing technological solutions GWP could be reduced in-80.9 %, ecotoxicity in-45.6 %, biodiversity loss in-58.6 % and human health in-67.1 %. Spanish Single-Family Houses built in timber, earth or straw-bale are real alternatives to current cement traditional building."
1,"Land surface temperature (LST) is an essential parameter in land-atmosphere interaction. However, it is still poorly understood about the effects of seasonal LST on the interannual LST change and the dominant driving force for the variation in LST. In this study, trends of time-series LST were analyzed by using both linear and nonlinear methods. Two indices were developed to evaluate the effects of seasonal LST trends on interannual LST change. The main driving factor of LST was identified based on each pixel. Two turning points were founded in 2007 and 2011 during the study period of 2003-2019. A significant cooling trend of LST appeared from 2007 to 2011/2012 with the rates of -0.2237 K/year (daytime) and-0.1239 K/year (nighttime). LST increased in almost all seasons except the daytime in autumn. The warming effect in spring and winter contributed 69.43% to interannual warming of daytime LST, and accounted for 59.02% of interannual warming of nighttime LST. In most regions of China, air temperature and vegetation were the dominant factors influencing the change of LST. The current research improved our understanding of changes of LST and the results can serve for mitigating and adapting to climate change."
1,"In New Zealand, over 87% of the population currently resides in cities. Urban trees can face a myriad of complex challenges including loss of green space, public health issues, and harm to the existence of urban dwellers and trees, along with domestic greenhouse gas (GHG) and air pollutant emissions. Despite New Zealand being a biodiversity hotspot in terms of natural environments, there is a lack of knowledge about native tree species' regulating service (i.e., tree development and eco-physiological responses to low air quality, GHG, rising air temperatures, and drought) and how they grow in built-up environments such as cities. Therefore, we argue for the value of these native species in terms of ecosystem services and insist that they need to be viewed in relation to how they will respond to urban abiotic extremes and climate change. We propose to diversify planted forests for several reasons: (1) to improve awareness of the benefits of diverse planted urban forests; (2) to foster native tree research in urban environments, finding new keystone species; and (3) to improve the evidence of urban ecosystem resilience based on New Zealand native trees' regulating services. This article aims to re-evaluate our understanding of whether New Zealand's native trees can deal with environmental stress conditions similarly to more commonly planted alien species."
1,"Climate simulations are the fuel to drive hydrological models that are used to assess the impacts of climate change and variability on hydrological parameters, such as river discharges, soil moisture, and evapotranspiration. Unlike with cars, where we know which fuel the engine requires, we never know in advance what unexpected side effects might be caused by the fuel we feed our models with. Sometimes we increase the fuel's octane number (bias correction) to achieve better performance and find out that the model behaves differently but not always as was expected or desired. This study investigates the impacts of projected climate change on the hydrology of the Upper Blue Nile catchment using two model ensembles consisting of five global CMIP5 Earth system models and 10 regional climate models (CORDEX Africa). WATCH forcing data were used to calibrate an eco-hydrological model and to bias-correct both model ensembles using slightly differing approaches. On the one hand it was found that the bias correction methods considerably improved the performance of average rainfall characteristics in the reference period (1970-1999) in most of the cases. This also holds true for non-extreme discharge conditions between Q(20) and Q(80). On the other hand, bias-corrected simulations tend to overemphasize magnitudes of projected change signals and extremes. A general weakness of both uncorrected and bias-corrected simulations is the rather poor representation of high and low flows and their extremes, which were often deteriorated by bias correction. This inaccuracy is a crucial deficiency for regional impact studies dealing with water management issues and it is therefore important to analyse model performance and character-istics and the effect of bias correction, and eventually to exclude some climate models from the ensemble. However, the multi-model means of all ensembles project increasing average annual discharges in the Upper Blue Nile catchment and a shift in seasonal patterns, with decreasing discharges in June and July and increasing discharges from August to November."
1,"Background and Aims Seed persistence in soil depends on environmental factors that affect seed dormancy and germination, such as temperature and water availability. In high-elevation ecosystems, rapid changes in these environmental factors because of climate change can impact future plant recruitment. To date, our knowledge on how soil seed banks from high-elevation environments will respond to climate change and extreme climate-related events is limited. Here, using the seedling emergence method, we investigated the effects of reduced snow cover, fire and drought on the density and diversity of germinants from soil seed banks of two high-elevation plant communities: a tall alpine herbfield and a treeline ecotone.Methods In Autumn 2020, we collected soil samples and characterized the standing vegetation of both communities at Kosciuszko National Park, Australia. Subsequently, we carried out a factorial experiment and subjected the soil samples to a series of manipulative treatments using greenhouse studies.Key Results The treeline had a larger and more diverse soil seed bank than the herbfield. A reduction in snow had a negative effect on the number of germinants in the herbfield and increased the dissimilarity with the standing vegetation, whereas the treeline responses were mainly neutral. Fire did not significantly affect the number of germinants but decreased the evenness values in both communities. The drought treatment reduced the number and richness of germinants and increased the dissimilarity with the standing vegetation in both communities. Plant functional forms explained some of the detected effects, but seed functional traits did not.Conclusions Our study suggests that simulated climate change will affect plant recruitment from soil seed banks in a variety of ways. Changes in snow cover and incidences of fire and drought might be key drivers of germination from the soil seed bank and therefore the future composition of alpine plant communities."
1,"Understanding the impacts of extreme weather events on freshwater ecosystems is imperative during a time when a multitude of challenges compromises these environments' health. Exploring how such events affect macroinvertebrate communities in rivers sheds light on the resilience of freshwater ecosystems, which is essential for human well-being and biodiversity conservation. In this study, long-term time series of benthic macroinvertebrate communities from four sites along three freshwater streams within the Rhine-Main-Observatory Long-Term Ecological Research site in Germany were analyzed. Each of them was sampled annually over a span of similar to 20 years to assess the impacts of extreme weather events (floods, droughts, and extreme heat) on macroinvertebrate communities. The findings reveal that the effects of extreme events are site-specific, suggesting that the impacts of an extreme event can vary based on several potential factors, including the life history traits of the organisms within the community and, among others, the hydrography of the site. Moreover, the analysis highlights that the cumulative impact of these events over time is more significant than the impact of a single event's magnitude, while following distinct temporal dynamics. This underscores the importance of considering both the temporal dynamics and the biological characteristics of communities when evaluating the consequences of extreme weather events on biodiversity, illustrating that the resilience of freshwater ecosystems and their biodiversity under such conditions depends on a complex interplay of factors rather than the severity of individual events."

A planned response strategy could minimize exposure of socioeconomic systems to potential hazards and may even offer wider advantages. Response strategies can be informed by understanding the hazards, assessing exposure and assessing risks and opportunities. This paper assesses exposure of key socioeconomic systems to the hazards of ocean acidification and analyzes the risks and opportunities of this exposure from Small Island Developing States (SIDS) perspectives. Key socioeconomic systems that are likely to be affected by ocean acidification are identified. A risk analysis matrix is developed to evaluate the risks or opportunities arising from ocean acidification. Analysis of the matrix reveals similarities and differences in potential adaptive responses at global and regional levels. For example, while ocean acidification poses significant threats to SIDS from more frequent toxic wild-caught seafood events and, potentially destruction of coral reef structure and habitat, SIDS may have a relative advantage in aquaculture and an important role to play in global marine ecosystem conservation."
1,"Deforestation and agricultural expansion in the tropics affect local and regional climatic conditions, leading to synergistic negative impacts on land ecosystems. Climatic changes manifest in increased inter- and intraseasonal variations and frequency of extreme climatic events (i.e., droughts and floods), which have evident consequences for aboveground biodiversity. However, until today, there have been no studies on how land use affects seasonal variations below ground in tropical ecosystems, which may be more buffered against climatic variation. Here, we analyzed seasonal variations in soil parameters, basal respiration, microbial communities, and abundances of soil invertebrates along with microclimatic conditions in rainforest and monocultures of oil palm and rubber in Sumatra, Indonesia. About 75% (20 out of 26) of the measured litter and soil, microbial, and animal parameters varied with season, with seasonal changes in 50% of the parameters depending on land use. Land use affected seasonal variations in microbial indicators associated with carbon availability and cycling rate. The magnitude of seasonal variations in microbial parameters in the soil of monocultures was almost 40% higher than in the soil of rainforest. Measured parameters were associated with short-term climatic conditions (3-day period air humidity) in plantations, but not in rainforest, confirming a reduced soil buffering ability in plantations. Overall, our findings suggest that land use temporally shifts and increases the magnitude of seasonal variations of the belowground ecosystem compartment, with microbial communities responding most strongly. The increased seasonal variations in soil biota in plantations likely translate into more pronounced fluctuations in essential ecosystem functions such as nutrient cycling and carbon sequestration, and these ramifications ultimately may compromise the stability of tropical ecosystems in the long term. As the observed seasonal dynamics is likely to increase with both local and global climate change, these shifts need closer attention for the long-term sustainable management of plantation systems in the tropics."
1,"The increasing trend in drought events under the background of global warming makes it more important to understand the drought effect on vegetation photosynthesis. While diverse global gross primary production (GPP) datasets were adopted to investigate the drought impact on photosynthesis, few studies focused on the discrepancies of drought response among different GPP datasets, especially for the cumulative drought impact. Therefore, a total of twenty-six global GPP datasets based on process, machine learning (ML), and light-use efficiency (LUE) model schemes were obtained to appraise the cumulative impact of drought stress on photosynthesis from 2001 to 2010. Moreover, a relatively reliable global pattern of drought's cumulative effect on vegetation photosynthesis was acquired from these global GPP products through probability analysis. The results illustrated that the cumulative impact of drought existed in 52.11% of vegetation cover land with the cumulative time scales dominantly at a short term (1-4 months, 31.81%). Obvious heterogeneity of the drought cumulative effect in space and different vegetation functional types was observed, as the reliability of the drought effect decreased with latitude decreasing and a higher sensitivity to drought in herbaceous vegetation than woody plants. Our findings highlighted the importance of ways in characterizing moisture conditions across vegetation types among various GPP models and the necessity of GPP dataset selection in investigating drought effect on photosynthesis."
1,"This study uses modeling results for coastal Louisiana to examine spatial and temporal variation in future wetland loss, and how this variation is influenced by different causes of land loss represented in the modeled processes. Fifty-year model predictions illustrate specific vulnerabilities of the wetlands and the conditions under which they occur, e.g., long-term changes vs. specific events. Environmental scenarios were used to examine model sensitivity to changes in future patterns of precipitation, evapotranspiration, subsidence, and eustatic sea level rise. Based on the model results, the magnitude of wetland loss increases more than three-fold from low to high scenario. The model allows vegetation types to change over time as environmental conditions change. Each type is sensitive to different land-loss causing factors. Across all scenarios, the largest contributor to wetland loss is inundation loss of saline marsh ->40% of loss. Inundation loss of brackish marsh increases from low to high scenarios. Salinity induced loss of fresh wetlands increases from low to high scenario and coastwide contributes <10% of the total wetland loss. Marsh edge erosion is relatively consistent in magnitude across scenarios but its relative contribution decreases from low to high. Model outputs show two contrasting responses to environmental change over a 50-year simulation: a relatively linear response of land area over time, and a non-linear response where a large collapse event is triggered in a single year. Land loss varied dramatically over time within the 50-year simulations with little loss in the first two decades and high rates of loss 25-40 years into the future. Across most of the coast, and for all scenarios, the majority of land loss is caused by excessive inundation. Understanding the threshold conditions for inundation for different species and species mixtures is crucial to predictions of vegetation change, and subsequent wetland loss. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

1,"In recent years, extreme weather phenomena have occurred worldwide, resulting in many catastrophic disasters. Under the impact of climate change, the frequency of extreme rainfall events in Taiwan will increase, according to a report on climate change in Taiwan. This study analyzed riverbed migrations, such as degradation and aggradation, caused by extreme rainfall events under climate change for the Choshui River, Taiwan. We used the CCHE1D model to simulate changes in flow discharge and riverbed caused by typhoon events for the base period (1979-2003) and the end of the 21st century (2075-2099) according to the climate change scenario of representative concentration pathways 8.5 (RCP8.5) and dynamical downscaling of rainfall data in Taiwan. According to the results on flow discharge, at the end of the 21st century, the average peak flow during extreme rainfall events will increase by 20% relative to the base period, but the time required to reach the peak will be 8 h shorter than that in the base period. In terms of the results of degradation and aggradation of the riverbed, at the end of the 21st century, the amount of aggradation will increase by 33% over that of the base period. In the future, upstream sediment will be blocked by the Chichi weir, increasing the severity of scouring downstream. In addition, due to the increased peak flow discharge in the future, the scouring of the pier may be more serious than it is currently. More detailed 2D or 3D hydrological models are necessary in future works, which could adequately address the erosive phenomena created by bridge piers. Our results indicate that not only will flood disasters occur within a shorter time duration, but the catchment will also face more severe degradation and aggradation in the future."
1,"Summer precipitation anomalies over eastern China are characterized spatially by meridionally banded structures fluctuating on interannual and interdecadal timescales, leading to regional droughts and floods. In addition to long-term trends, how these patterns may change under global warming has important implications for agricultural planning and water resources over this densely populated area. Using the latest Hadley Centre climate model, HadGEM3-GC2, this paper investigates the potential response of summer precipitation patterns over this region, by comparing the leading modes between a 4xCO(2) simulation and the model's pre-industrial control simulation. Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analyses show that the first two leading modes account for about 20% of summer rainfall variability. EOF1 is a monopole mode associated with the developing phase of ENSO events and EOF2 is a dipole mode associated with the decaying phase of ENSO. Under 4xCO(2) forcing, the dipole mode with a south-north orientation becomes dominant because of a strengthened influence from excessive warming of the Indian Ocean. On interdecadal time scales, the first EOF looks very different from the control simulation, showing a dipole mode of east-west contrast with enhanced influence from high latitudes."
1,"Hurricane activity in the North Atlantic Ocean has increased significantly since 1995 ( refs 1,2). This trend has been attributed to both anthropogenically induced climate change(3) and natural variability(1), but the primary cause remains uncertain. Changes in the frequency and intensity of hurricanes in the past can provide insights into the factors that influence hurricane activity, but reliable observations of hurricane activity in the North Atlantic only cover the past few decades(2). Here we construct a record of the frequency of major Atlantic hurricanes over the past 270 years using proxy records of vertical wind shear and sea surface temperature ( the main controls on the formation of major hurricanes kin this region(1,3-5)) from corals and a marine sediment core. The record indicates that the average frequency of major hurricanes decreased gradually from the 1760s until the early 1990s, reaching anomalously low values during the 1970s and 1980s. Furthermore, the phase of enhanced hurricane activity since 1995 is not unusual compared to other periods of high hurricane activity in the record and thus appears to represent a recovery to normal hurricane activity, rather than a direct response to increasing sea surface temperature. Comparison of the record with a reconstruction of vertical wind shear indicates that variability in this parameter primarily controlled the frequency of major hurricanes in the Atlantic over the past 270 years, suggesting that changes in the magnitude of vertical wind shear will have a significant influence on future hurricane activity."
1,"Nowadays, droughts and the impacts of climate change on water resources and the environment have had significant negative effects. Investigating the effects of climate change on drought indices and streamflow is crucial for water and environmental resource management. Therefore, the present study was conducted in two parts to examine the impact of climate change on drought indices and the amount of watershed streamflow. In the first part of this study, drought modeling was performed using the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and emission scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) at three temporal scales (3, 6, and 12 months) during the period of 1995-2055. Then, the climatic impacts on SPI for the period 2030-2055 under different climate scenarios were evaluated. The Karun basin in south west Iran, which is affected by droughts and the impacts of climate change, was selected as the study area. In the second part, the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) was utilized to estimate watershed streamflow for a 20-year period. Subsequently, in this section, the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) was employed to improve the results of ANFIS. Finally, streamflow prediction for the future period (2035-2055) was carried out using the hybrid model. The results indicated that analyzing precipitation through SPI under different climate scenarios could influence severe fluctuations in droughts within the study area. Frequency analysis of droughts under climate scenarios, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, demonstrated an upward trend with diverse spatial prevalence patterns. On the other hand, the duration of droughts increased towards the RCP4.5 scenario and remained unchanged according to the RCP8.5 climate scenario. The northeastern, eastern, and southeastern regions will experience the longest and most frequent droughts compared to current conditions. Furthermore, the results of the second part showed that the developed ANFIS-WOA model provides better results (RMSE = 127, MAPE = 98.50, NSE = 0.73) compared to the ANFIS-based model with evaluation criteria of RMSE = 127, MAPE = 98.50, NSE = 0.73. Additionally, in the investigation of the impact of climate change on streamflow using ANFIS-WOA in the time range of 2030 to 2055, the flow rate in most months of the year will decrease by approximately 20 units compared to the baseline period, with a greater intensity of reduction in the RCP8.5 scenario than RCP4.5. However, there will be an increase in streamflow by approximately 20 (m3/s) only in October. The approach used in this study demonstrates the effects of climate change on the level of drought and watershed streamflow, serving as a warning for decision-makers and managers to better manage available water resources. Finally, this approach is recommended for implementation in other similar regions for water resource management and water supply assessment."
0,"Objective: To develop a framework to guide action in the public health nutrition workforce to develop policies and practices addressing factors contributing to climate change. Design: Action/consultative research. Setting: Interviews - South Australia, questionnaire - Australia. Subjects: Interviews - key informants (n 6) were from various government, academic and non-government positions, invited through email. Questionnaire - participants were members of the public health nutrition workforce (n 186), recruited to the study through emails from public health nutrition contacts for each State in Australia (with the exception of South Australia). Results: Support by participants for climate change as a valid role for dietitians and nutritionists was high (78%). However, climate change was ranked low against Other public health nutrition priorities. Support of participants to conduct programmes to address climate change from professional and work organisations was low. The final framework developed included elements of advocacy/lobbying, policy, professional recognition/support, organisational support, knowledge/skills, partnerships and programmes. Conclusions: This research demonstrates a need for public health nutrition to address climate change, which requires support by organisations, policy, improved knowledge and increased professional development opportunities."
0,"A global warming projection was conducted on the Earth Simulator by using a very high horizontal resolution atmospheric general circulation model with 20-km grid. Tropical cyclones (TCs) and the rain band (Baiu) during the East Asian summer monsoon season are selected as the main targets of this study, because these bring typical extreme events but so far the global climate models have not given reliable simulations and projections due to their insufficient resolutions. The model reproduces TCs and a Baiu rain band reasonably well under the present-day climate conditions. In a warmer climate at the end of this century, the model projects, under the IPCC SIZES A1B scenario, that the annual mean occurrence number of TCs decreases by about 30% globally (but increased in the North Atlantic) and TCs with large maximum surface winds increase. The Baiu rain band activities tend to intensify and last longer until August, suggesting more damages due to heavy rainfalls in a warmer climate."
1,"Introduction: Inuit from communities across the Arctic are still existing in subsistence living. Hunting, fishing and gathering is an important part of the culture and the harvested 'country food' provides sources of nutrients invaluable to maintaining the health of the populations. However, Inuit are voicing their concerns on how observed climate change is impacting on their traditional life. The objective of this study was to report on observed climate changes and how they affect the country food harvest in two communities in the Canadian Arctic. The nutritional implications of these changes are discussed and also how the communities need to plan for adaptations. Methods: A total of 17 adult participants from Repulse Bay and Kugaaruk, Nunavut were invited to participate. Participants were selected using purposeful sampling methods selecting the most knowledgeable community members for the study. Inuit Elders, hunters, processors of the animals, and other community members above the age of 18 years were selected for their knowledge of harvesting and the environment. Two-day bilingual focus groups using semi-directed, unstructured questions were held in each community to discuss perceived climate changes related to the access and availability of key species. Key topics of focus included ice, snow, weather, marine mammals, land mammals, fish, species ranges, migration patterns, and quality and quantity of animal populations. Maps were used to pinpoint harvesting locations. A qualitative analysis categorizing strategy was used for analysis of data. This strategy involves coding data in order to form themes and to allow for cross-comparison analysis between communities. Each major animal represented a category; other categories included land, sea, and weather. Results were verified by the participants and community leaders. Results: Three themes emerged from the observations: (1) ice/snow/water; (2) weather; and (3) changes in species. Climate change can affect the accessibility and availability of the key species of country foods including caribou, marine mammals, fish, birds and plants. Various observations on relationship between weather and population health and distributions of the animal/plant species were reported. While many of the observations were common between the two communities, many were community specific and inconsistent. Participants from both communities found that climate change was affecting the country food harvest in both positive and negative ways. Key nutrients that could be affected are protein, iron, zinc, n-3 fatty acids, selenium and vitamins D and A. Conclusion: Community members from Repulse Bay and Kugaaruk have confirmed that climate change is affecting their traditional food system. Local and regional efforts are needed to plan for food security and health promotion in the region, and global actions are needed to slow down the process of climate change."
1,"In this paper, precipitation concentrations across the Pearl River basin and the associated spatial patterns are analyzed based on daily precipitation data of 42 rain gauging stations during the period 1960-2005. Regions characterized by the different changing properties of precipitation concentration index (CI) are identified. The southwest and northeast parts of the Pearl River basin are characterized by lower and decreasing precipitation CI; the northwest and south parts of the study river basin show higher and increasing precipitation CI. Higher but decreasing precipitations CI are found in the West and East River basin. Comparison of precipitation CI trends before and after 1990 shows that most parts of the Pearl River basin are characterized by increasing precipitation CI after 1990. Decreasing precipitation CI after 1990 (compared to precipitation CI changes before 1990) is observed only in a few stations located in the lower Gui River and the lower Yu River. Significant increasing precipitation CI after 1990 is detected in the West River, lower North River and upper Beipan River. These changes of precipitation CI in the Pearl River basin are likely to be associated with the consequences of the well-evidenced global warming. These findings can contribute to basin-scale water resource management and conservation of ecological environment in the Pearl River basin."
1,"SCIENCE FOR SOCIETY As the main source of freshwater on land, precipitation filters into the soil where some of it is used by plants as a green water fluxand some flows into rivers as the visible blue water flux.How much water ends up in the greenflux is key for sustaining crops and other vegetation, and for societal food security. The bluewater flux sustains the aquatic ecosystems, and is also critical for societal water security, e.g., for drinking water but also for crop irrigation, which shifts blue water into green. Our study shows that the green flux is mostly greater than the blue around the world. Expanding crops and irrigation to feed a growing human population will shift more blue water into green, exacerbating the blue water vulnerability to future climate change. These results are important for guiding land-use planning to optimally balance various freshwater needs on land."
1,"Urban residents are suffering from serious thermal stress resulting from urban heat island and global warming. Investigators have explored several methods to address this issue. Vegetation, especially trees, were found to play a vital part in urban environments. It produces a cooling effect by reducing temperature and radiation levels. To find thermal performances of trees in detail, this study physically measured two urban parks during August 2019 in a satellite city of China regarding their thermal environments relevant to tree planting indices. There were three planting indices used, sky view factor, leaf area index and enclosure area. Through associating them with thermal indicators by linear regression, all of the indices were confirmed to have significant thermal effects. Every 0.1 increase in sky view factor resulted in an increase of 1 degrees C air temperature, 0.16 m/s air velocity, 40 W/m(2) solar radiation level and 1.6 degrees C mean radiant temperature. Same effects were found in nearly 0.4 leaf area index decrease and approximately 20 m(2) enclosure area increase. These results provide very optimistic directions for future urban forestry planning and landscaping."
1,"In the winter-spring of 2001, South Florida experienced one of the worst droughts in its recorded history. Out of a myriad of ecological concerns identified during this time, the potential for catastrophic peat fire and negative impacts to wading bird reproduction emerged as critical issues. Water managers attempted to strike a balance between the environment and protection of water supplies for agriculture and urban interests. It became evident, however, that a broad-scale, integrated way to portray and prioritise ecological stress was lacking in the Florida Everglades, despite this being considered a necessary tool for addressing issues of environmental protection. In order to provide a framework for evaluating various water management operations using real-time information, we developed GIS-based indices of peat-fire risk and wading bird habitat suitability. These indices, based on real physical, chemical, and biological data, describe two ecological conditions that help define the physical and biological integrity of the Everglades. In addition to providing continuous, updated assessments throughout the drought period, we incorporated predictive models of water levels to evaluate how various water management alternatives might exacerbate or alleviate ecological stress during this time.

1,"Climate Impact Indices (CIIs) are being increasingly used in different socioeconomic sectors to transfer information about climate change impacts to stakeholders. Typically, CIIs comprise into a single index several weather variables -such as temperature, wind speed, precipitation and humidity- which are relevant for a particular problem of interest. Moreover, most of the CIIs require daily (or monthly) physical coherence among these variables for their proper calculation. This constraints the number of statistical downscaling techniques suitable for a component-wise approach to this problem. We test the suitability of the alternative direct downscaling approach in which the downscaling method is applied directly to the CII, thus circumventing the multi-variable problem and allowing the use of a wider range of downscaling methods. For illustrative purposes, we consider two popular CIIs -the Fire Weather Index (FWI) and the Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET), used in the wildfire and tourism sectors, respectively- and compare the performance of the two approaches using the analog method, a simple and popular method providing inter-variable dependence. The results obtained with 'perfect' reanalysis predictors are comparable for both approaches, although smaller accuracy is obtained in general with the direct approach. Moreover, similar climate change 'deltas' are obtained with both approaches when applied to an illustrative future global projection using the ECHAM5 model. Overall, there is a trade-off between performance and simplicity which needs to be balanced for each particular application."
1,"Introduction: Mosquito-borne diseases represent a global public health concern and are responsible for over 700 000 deaths globally every year. Additionally, many mosquito species have undergone a dramatic global expansion due to various factors, including climate change, and forecasts indicate that mosquito populations will persist in dispersing beyond their present geographic range, namely in temperate climates. The research literature on this topic has grown in recent years, including some systematic evidence synthesis. However, to provide a comprehensive overview of this growing literature needed for policy action, a summary of this evidence, including existing systematic reviews, is required. This study aims to undertake an umbrella review that explores the impacts of climate change on the emergence and reemergence of diseases transmitted by mosquitoes in temperate zones and the publication of the protocol is a fundamental step to ensure the credibility, transparency and reproducibility of this research. Methods and Analysis: Studies published in scientific journals indexed by PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Epistemonikos, and Web of Science Core Collection to be included in this umbrella review will meet the following criteria: the topic of study (climate change and mosquito-borne diseases), regions (temperate zones), study designs (systematic reviews and meta-analysis), language (any) and date (since inception until December 31st, st , 2023). Titles and abstracts from selected articles will be evaluated by two authors independently and any discrepancy will be resolved through consensus or, if not possible, through a third author. The data will be extracted, and the risk of bias will be evaluated. The quality of the methodology of the included reviews will be assessed using AMSTAR 2. A narrative synthesis will examine the included systematic reviews. The quality of evidence for all outcomes will be judged using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation working group methodology."
1,"During periods of strong environmental change, some areas may serve as refugia, where components of biodiversity can find protection, persist and potentially expand from should conditions again become favourable. The refugia concept has previously been used in the context of climatic change, to describe climatically stable areas in which taxa survived past Quaternary glacial-interglacial oscillations, or where they might persist in the future under anthropogenic climate change. However, with the recognition that Earth has entered the Anthropocene, an era in which human activities are the dominant driving force on ecosystems, it is critical to also consider human pressures on the environment as factors limiting species distributions. Here, we present a novel concept, Anthropocene refugia, to refer to areas that provide spatial and temporal protection from human activities and that will remain suitable for a given taxonomic unit in the long-term. It integrates a deep-time perspective on species biogeography that provides information on the natural rather than current-day relictual distribution of species, with spatial information on modern and future anthropogenic threats. We define the concept and propose a methodology to effectively identify and map realized and potential current and future refugia, using examples for two megafaunal species as a proof of concept. We argue that identifying Anthropocene refugia will improve biodiversity conservation and restoration by allowing better prediction of key areas for conservation and potential for re-expansions today and in the future. More generally, it forms a new conceptual framework to assess and manage the impact of anthropogenic activities on past, current and future patterns of species distributions. This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'The past is a foreign country: how much can the fossil record actually inform conservation?'"
1,"Projection of drought under a changing climate is important for drought risk assessment. Changes in precipitation (P) and potential evapotranspiration (ETp) are expected to influence future drought occurrence. Thus, it is important to include both factors to accurately quantify change in drought frequency under future climate scenarios. Standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) is a widely used index in drought assessment because it considers the influence of both P and ETp on drought. Thus, in this study we used SPEI to quantify change in drought frequency under two different emission scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) in the wheat belt of southeastern Australia with climatic data downscaled from 34 global climate models (GCMs). We also investigated whether differences ETp models would make a difference on drought projection. Therefore, we employed five different traditional ETp models (Penman, Jensen-Haise, Makkink, Abtew, Hargreaves) and three random forest (RF)-based models to calculate SPEI in this study. Results showed that drought, especially moderate and severe drought, would occur more frequently under future climate scenarios and the increased frequency was generally greater in spring and winter than in summer and autumn. Severe drought occurring in spring would increase by 3.1%-21.7% under RCP4.5 and 5.2%-41.0% under RCP8.5. In autumn, the likely mean increase of severe drought frequency was 0.7%-13.0% under RCP4.5 and 2.7%-27.9% under RCP8.5. Differences in the projected increase of drought frequency were found among the different ETp models. In general, RF-based ETp models, which projected larger increases in ETp, generally also projected larger increases in drought occurrence. A multilinear regression relationship was built between changes in drought frequency and changes in ETp and P. The regression showed that the increased drought frequency was a combined result of the increasing ETp and decreasing P, and that the increasing ETp might be the more dominant factor. The contribution of GCMs, RCPs, different ETp models, and their interaction to the uncertainty in drought projection was quantified with the use of analysis of variance. Results showed that GCMs and their interaction with RCPs were the dominant factors influencing uncertainty in drought projection."
1,"Cities and metropolitan areas are increasingly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, including rising temperatures and extreme weather events. One of the most significant impacts of climate change on urban areas is the urban heat island effect, which occurs when a particular area in cities experiences higher temperatures than its surrounding areas owing to human activity and the built environment. Urban greenspaces play an influential role in regulating and mitigating to eliminate these adverse effects. This study presents a novel approach to develop a mathematical model to estimate the greenspace requirements based on the reduction of land surface temperature. This mathematical model is developed to estimate the greenspace requirement based on literature-based evidence and an observed data set considering the impact of green spaces on reducing the average land surface temperature. The study employed the curve fitting method to generate the coefficient of the twenty equations on the observed data set. Out of the generated equations, 14 equations are selected based on a high R2 value. To predict greenspace area based on temperature drop, these 14 equations are further validated. The best-fitted equation is selected based on a high r2 value, lower root means square value (RMSE) and mean absolute error value (MAE). As a result, the third Order Polynomial Equation is considered as the greenspace area is the function of land surface temperature based on its High r2 Value (0.89), RMSE value i.e.,14.49 and MAE value, i.e., 9.61. The equation can then be used to estimate the required greenspace area to achieve a desired LST reduction in a given area. The resulting model provides valuable information for urban planners and policymakers to create liveable and sustainable cities that incorporate sufficient green spaces for temperature regulation. The paper concludes by highlighting the need for further research to better understand the effectiveness of urban greenspaces in mitigating temperature drop."
1,"For an agricultural country such as Thailand, converting agricultural waste into biochar offers a potential solution to manage massive quantities of crop residues following harvest. This research studied the structure and chemical composition of biochar obtained from cassava rhizomes, cassava stems and corncobs, produced using a patented locally-manufactured biochar kiln using low-cost appropriate technology designed to be fabricated locally by farmers. The research found that cassava stems yielded the highest number of Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area in the biochar product, while chemical analysis indicated that corncobs yielded the highest amount of C (81.35%). The amount of H in the corncob biochar was also the highest (2.42%). The study also showed biochar produced by slow pyrolysis was of a high quality, with stable C and low H/C ratio. Biochar's high BET surface area and total pore volume makes it suitable for soil amendment, contributing to reduced soil density, higher soil moisture and aeration and reduced leaching of plant nutrients from the rhizosphere. Biochar also provides a conducive habitat for beneficial soil microorganisms. The findings indicate that soil incorporation of biochar produced from agricultural crop residues can enhance food security and mitigate the contribution of the agricultural sector to climate change impacts."
1,"The following issues discusses in the article: loss of biodiversity, poverty, climate change and environmental pollution. Currently, the world's population is growing rapidly, so food security of mankind in the XXI century remains an unsolved problem. The satisfaction of quantitative requirements in food products is the most important task. As it is solved, the following problem arises to meet the nutritional needs in terms of quality and environmental protection. Thus, the problems of ecotechnologies for eco-agriculture and eco-enterprises for sustainable food security come to the fore. Today, the Earth's biosphere is accumulating at an accelerated rate several chemical pollutants derived from anthropogenic activities in agriculture, manufacturing industry, nuclear, space, nano- and biotechnologies. Speaking about the loss of biodiversity, it should be noted that factory farming largely involves monocropping. Chemical fertilizers and pesticides (including herbicides) are used liberally. On the environmental side, chemicals and over exploitation of groundwater lead to degradation of land, aquifers and biodiversity. In a nutshell, the shift from exploitative to sustainable agriculture needs to be in the direction of using biologically-derived inputs than chemically-synthesized inputs to augment yield increase. It is important to note that for intelligent interaction with nature, it is necessary to form environmental knowledge among new generations."
1,"Heat and drought are prominent abiotic stressors that limit crop productivity and yield, particularly concerning climate change; therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying plant stress responses is crucial for stress-tolerant crop production. This study conducted a transcriptomic analysis to elucidate how garlic (Allium sativum L.) responds to drought and heat stress conditions. Transcriptome libraries were generated to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) induced by drought and heat stresses. Functional classification and clustering analysis of DEGs revealed stress-specific gene expression patterns. Notably, cell wall-related genes were implicated in the drought response, whereas heat stress was associated with heat stress transcription factors and heat shock proteins. Our results provide essential information for future studies on stress tolerances in garlic."
1,"Organic waste production has greatly increased following human sprawl and led to the development of landfills in recent decades. This abundant and reliable anthropogenic food source has favored several species, some of which consequently became overabundant. Landfills present hazards to wildlife, which may suffocate on plastic materials, tangle on cords, and get exposed to pollutants and pathogens. In response to environmental and public health concerns over the maintenance of landfills, the European Commission proposed to close the landfills. Our objective was to determine the impact of Landfill European Directive on the White Stork (Ciconia ciconia) whose population recovery and growth was linked to landfill exploitation. We implemented species distribution models to project future distribution in the absence of landfills in the Community of Madrid (Spain). Habitat suitability was estimated based on nest occurrence and we included data from land cover types, human population density, and two different climate change scenarios (i.e. emissions in low and high shared socioeconomic pathways). Given that protection measures, particularly implemented in protected areas, were associated with population recovery, we also evaluated the overlapping degree between protected areas and projected distribution. Our models predicted a sharp decline in breeding population distribution with landfill closure, reaching values similar to the 1984 breeding census when the species was categorized as threatened. Our results also suggest a decrease in maximum habitat suitability. Climate change also contributed to a reduction in breeding population distribution given model predictions for the extreme emission pathway (ssp5). Measures such as gradual change in landfill management, continuous monitoring of breeding populations, and evaluation of the White Stork use of natural feeding areas before and after landfill closure, should be considered."
1,"Climate change is projected to cause an increase in the severity and frequency of extreme weather events such as heat waves and droughts. Such changes present planning and operating challenges and risks to many economic sectors. In the electricity sector, statistics of extreme events in the past have been used to help plan for future peak loads, determine associated infrastructure requirements, and evaluate operational risks, but industry-standard planning tools have yet to be coupled with or informed by temperature models to explore the irhpacts of the new normal on planning studies. For example, high ambient temperatures during heat waves reduce the output capacity and efficiency of gas-fired combustion turbines just when they are needed most to meet peak demands. This paper describes the development and application of a production cost and unit commitment model coupled to high resolution, hourly temperature data and a temperature-dependent load model. The coupled system has the ability to represent the impacts of hourly temperature on load conditions and available capacity and efficiency of combustion turbines, and therefore capture the potential impacts on system reserve and production cost. Ongoing work expands this capability to address the impacts of water availability and temperature on power grid operation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
1,"Plants exist in close association with uncountable numbers of microorganisms around, on, and within them. Some of these endophytically colonize plant roots. The colonization of roots by certain symbiotic strains of plant-associated bacteria and fungi results in these plants performing better than plants whose roots are colonized by only the wild populations of microbes. We consider here crop plants whose roots are inhabited by introduced organisms, referring to them as Enhanced Plant Holobionts (EPHs). EPHs frequently exhibit resistance to specific plant diseases and pests (biotic stresses); resistance to abiotic stresses such as drought, cold, salinity, and flooding; enhanced nutrient acquisition and nutrient use efficiency; increased photosynthetic capability; and enhanced ability to maintain efficient internal cellular functioning. The microbes described here generate effects in part through their production of Symbiont-Associated Molecular Patterns (SAMPs) that interact with receptors in plant cell membranes. Such interaction results in the transduction of systemic signals that cause plant-wide changes in the plants' gene expression and physiology. EPH effects arise not only from plant-microbe interactions, but also from microbe-microbe interactions like competition, mycoparasitism, and antibiotic production. When root and shoot growth are enhanced as a consequence of these root endophytes, this increases the yield from EPH plants. An additional benefit from growing larger root systems and having greater photosynthetic capability is greater sequestration of atmospheric CO2. This is transferred to roots where sequestered C, through exudation or root decomposition, becomes part of the total soil carbon, which reduces global warming potential in the atmosphere. Forming EPHs requires selection and introduction of appropriate strains of microorganisms, with EPH performance affected also by the delivery and management practices."
1,"The use of environmental-stress resilient plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) offers an organic solution to sustainable agriculture, under rapid climate change. Our laboratory has previously reported the drought-ameliorating property of an exopolysaccharide-secreting PGPR strain, Bacillus endophyticus J13 on Arabidopsis thaliana. In this study, A. thaliana roots were inoculated with J13 under well-watered and water-stressed conditions (under controlled plant growth conditions). To understand the mechanism of drought amelioration, impact of J13 on plant ABA biosynthesis and signaling was analyzed. It was found that the ABA levels in water-stress, inoculated plants were lower than the water-stressed plants, without inoculation. Also, the expression of ABA biosynthesis genes: NCED3, AAO3 and ABA2, was downregulated in inoculated treatments under water-stress as compared to non-inoculated, water-stress treatments. J13 did not cause any modulation in the expression of ABA-dependent signaling gene SnRK2 and the ABA-independent signaling gene, DREB2A, under water-stress in Arabidopsis shoots. On treating the bacteria with EDTA (which negatively impacts biofilm levels), we observed that J13 fails to impart stress tolerance to plants under water deficit conditions. The soil moisture content in soil adhered to roots and exopolysaccharide (EPS) content was significantly higher in the plants under water-stressed, inoculated treatments than the non-inoculated plants. This study unravels the mechanism of drought amelioration by J-13 on Arabidopsis by modulating soil moisture content through EPS secretion, thereby eliminating the need for enhanced ABA biosynthesis and signaling."
1,"Plant-herbivore interactions are influenced by chemical plant traits, which can vary depending on the plants' abiotic and biotic environment. Drought events, which are predicted to become more frequent and prolonged due to climate change, may affect primary and secondary plant metabolites contributing to constitutive resistance. Furthermore, the ability of plants to respond to herbivore attack in terms of induced resistance may be altered under drought conditions. We assessed the effects of drought stress on constitutive and induced apple plant resistance to a generalist insect herbivore by quantifying plant and herbivore responses in concert. Plants were exposed to different drought stress intensities (constitutive resistance) and subsequently to herbivore damage treatments that included different damage durations (induced resistance). As drought stress intensified, plant growth and concentrations of the leaf phenolic phloridzin decreased, whereas leaf glucose concentrations increased. Changes in fructose concentrations and in herbivore feeding preferences indicated a non-monotonic shift in constitutive resistance. Moderately stressed plants showed reduced fructose concentrations and were consumed least, while severely stressed plants were fructose-enriched and consumed most compared to well-watered control plants showing intermediate fructose concentrations and palatability. We found no evidence for effects of drought stress on induced resistance, as herbivore feeding preferences for undamaged over damaged plants were independent of drought intensity. Our results suggest a strong role of primary metabolites for drought-dependent variation in constitutive plant resistance and offer novel experimental insights into the effects of drought stress on induced plant resistance across a gradient of water deprivation."
1,"Beach loss and shoreline retreat caused by sea level rise (SLR) is considered one of the most worldwide significant issues. The Mediterranean coastline of Egypt (approximately 1066 km) is likely to face beach erosion, particularly in the low-lying and sandy coastal areas in the future as a direct response to SLR. Consequently, the projection of future shoreline recession and corresponding beach loss due to SLR using the Bruun rule were investigated to assess the proper impacts of SLR on the shoreline recession and beach loss. In addition, the uncertainties ratios associated with SLR scenarios and sediment sizes were assessed. Furthermore, this study investigated the influence of local land subsidence in combination with SLR scenarios on the shoreline recession and associated beach loss along the Nile Delta coastline. The ensemble-mean regional SLR data included representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios and 21 models of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). The projected shoreline retreats and associated average beach loss in the future 2081-2100 were ranged from 12.6 m and 11.3 km(2) to 41.9 m and 19.2 km(2) for the ensemble-mean SLR RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, respectively. The uncertainty caused by the sediment size of 0.15 to 0.35 mm ranged from 17% to 30% for RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, respectively. The projected annual shoreline retreats ranged from 0.36 to 0.65 m/yr for the ensemble-mean SLR in combination with local land subsidence for RCP2.6 and 0.48 to 0.85 m/yr for RCP8.5, respectively. Highly vulnerable areas to shoreline recession for SLR and local land subsidence were detected from EL-Manzala lake to Port Said coastlines, Abo Qir bay, from Rosetta to Damietta promontories, and Alexandria coastline. Thus, shoreline retreat and associated beach loss due to SLR is an urgent issue that should be addressed through the integrated coastal zone management strategies of Egypt."
1,"Snowfall is a critical element of natural disasters to the United States (US) with strong climatic and socioeconomic influences. Meanwhile, snowfall acts as a driving force to the US water supplies for agriculture, drinking water and hydropower. However, so far, what factors influence the US snowfall variations and how these factors change under global warming remain unclear. Here, we found that large-scale influences of the early-winter US snowfall experienced a shift from the Pacific to the Atlantic side around 2000, through observational analysis and climate model simulations. The Pacific/North American pattern was identified as a dominant driver of the early-winter US snowfall before 2000, but its impact became much weaker in the 21st century as its associated western North American cell shifted northward away from the US. Instead, the tropical and subpolar North Atlantic surface temperature has been influencing the early-winter US snowfall variations via teleconnections after 2000. This changed influence of US snowfall around 2000 is demonstrated to be related to the observed global warming pattern since the 1950s. Our study provides new perspectives in understanding large-scale snowfall pattern and variability and its connection to the global warming pattern."
1,"Knowledge of soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics following deforestation or reforestation is essential for evaluating carbon (C) budgets and cycle at regional or global scales. Worldwide land-use changes involving conversion of vegetation with different photosynthetic pathways (e.g. C-3 and C-4) offer a unique opportunity to quantify SOM decomposition rate and its response to climatic conditions using stable isotope techniques. We synthesized the results from 131 sites (including 87 deforestation observations and 44 reforestation observations) which were compiled from 36 published papers in the literatures as well as our observations in China's Qinling Mountains. Based on the C-13 natural abundance analysis, we evaluated the dynamics of new and old C in top soil (0-20cm) following land-use change and analyzed the relationships between soil organic C (SOC) decomposition rates and climatic factors. We found that SOC decomposition rates increased significantly with mean annual temperature and precipitation in the reforestation sites, and they were not related to any climatic factor in deforestation sites. The mean annual temperature explained 56% of variation in SOC decomposition rates by exponential model (y=0.0014e(0.1395x)) in the reforestation sites. The proportion of new soil C increased following deforestation and reforestation, whereas the old soil C showed an opposite trend. The proportion of new soil C exceeded the proportion of old soil C after 45.4years' reforestation and 43.4years' deforestation, respectively. The rates of new soil C accumulation increased significantly with mean annual precipitation and temperature in the reforestation sites, yet only significantly increased with mean annual precipitation in the deforestation sites. Overall, our study provides evidence that SOC decomposition rates vary with temperature and precipitation, and thereby implies that global warming may accelerate SOM decomposition."
1,"Improvements in the ability to model El Nino and other large-scale interannual climate variations have allowed for the development of seasonal climate forecasts, predicting rainfall and temperature anomalies for many places around the world. These forecasts have allowed developing countries to predict shortfalls in grain yields, with benefits for food security. Several countries communicate the forecasts to subsistence farmers, which could allow them to mitigate the effects of drought on their harvests by adapting their cropping decisions accordingly. However, it has not been demonstrated that subsistence farmers benefit from having access to the forecasts. Here we present evidence of subsistence farmers using the forecasts over multiple years to make different decisions and significantly improving their harvests when they do so. in a controlled study, farmers in Zimbabwe who reported adapting their farming methods to seasonal climate forecasts significantly improved their harvests over baseline amounts. Moreover, farmers who had attended a brief workshop and learned more about the forecasts were significantly more likely to use the forecasts than were farmers who learned of the forecasts through nonparticipatory channels."
1,"Agricultural crops grown in the irrigated semi -arid region of southern Idaho account for almost two-thirds of the median household income in the region. The impacts of climate change on cropping systems and the availability of water for irrigation would be a serious challenge for the state's economic dependence on agriculture. The objective of the study was to simulate the future impact of climate change on a crop rotation of spring wheat-potato-spring barley-sugarbeet grown in the semi -arid region of southern Idaho using conventional management practices and a high dairy manure application. The Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM2) simulations used bias-corrected and spatially disaggregated projections from the World Climate Research Program's coupled model inter-comparison project phase 5 to generate 40 GCM projections for the time from 2071-2099. The 28 -yr scenarios were designed to simulate the impact of temperature and CO2 regimes on crop production, soil nitrogen mineralization, nitrogen seepage, deep seepage of water, and nitrous oxide emissions. Data from a field experiment in southern Idaho with conventional fertilizer practices and annual applications of 52 Mg ha -1 dairy manure with a crop rotation of spring wheat-potato-spring barley-sugarbeet were used in the RZWQM2 simulations. Results were compared to a baseline scenario of conventional management practices, historical weather data, and ambient CO2. Spring wheat yield increased by 22% and 16% for manure and fertilizer treatments, respectively, compared to the baseline scenario. Using the same comparison, potato tuber yield decreased by 65% and 60% in the manure and fertilizer treatments, respectively, for the highest temperature and CO2 increase scenarios. Spring barley produced a 33% higher yield with increased temperature and CO2. However, yield decreased when temperature increased, but CO2 remained unchanged. Sugarbeet yields decreased by 16% and 18% for manure and fertilizer treatments, respectively, compared to the baseline scenario. Nitrogen mineralization, N seepage from the profile, and nitrous oxide emissions were strongly influenced by the manure applications, and there was little simulated impact of climate change on these processes. These simulation results indicate that genetic enhancements or alternative management will be needed to maintain potato and sugar beet production levels in semi -arid areas, while spring barley and wheat yields may increase, assuming adequate irrigation water supplies are available."
1,"In the context of climate change, how extreme climatic events, such as cyclones, will affect the foraging abilities of marine vertebrates is still poorly known. During the course of a study on the foraging behaviour of two tropical seabirds, red-footed boobies and great frigatebirds, several cyclones have affected their breeding grounds and foraging zones, allowing us to study their response to extreme wind conditions. We examined whether adults and young nave birds were able to predict the arrival of a cyclone and behave accordingly to reduce mortality risks and optimise foraging. We show that when a cyclone approached, juveniles and adults of the two species differed in their decisions to leave the colony for the sea. When the winds reached gale force, the juveniles of both species and adult frigatebirds remained at the colony, whereas adult boobies continued their foraging routine. The mortality of the individuals remaining on land remained limited. When encountering at-sea gale conditions, adult birds were able to avoid the centre of the low pressure systems and moved westward to bypass the route of the cyclones and circumvent the moving cyclone. Frigatebirds climb to high altitudes when close to the eye of the cyclone to bypass it at high speeds. These movements likely reduce the mortality risk at sea but can temporarily cause birds to move outside their normal range at sea or over land masses. We discuss the potential consequences of an increase in cyclonic conditions on seabird populations."
1,"Aim The increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather escalate the pressure of global warming on biodiversity. Globally, synergistic effects of multiple components of climate change have driven local extinctions and community collapses, raising concern about the irreversible deterioration of ecosystems. Here, we disentangle the pressure of increasing warming and frequency of extreme heatwaves on the population dynamics of tropical ringtail possums (family: Pseudocheiridae). Location The Australian Wet Tropics World Heritage Area. Method Ringtail possums' population dynamics were estimated between 1992 and 2021 using a hierarchical population model that explicitly described the state process and accounted for imperfect detection. Under our model, we propagated the estimated mechanisms governing the system by forecasting ringtails' population dynamics between 2022 and 2050. Derived from this process, we calculated the probability of absolute and quasi-extinction using different population viability thresholds. Results We find a strong negative effect of climate change on population dynamics, particularly extreme heatwaves, resulting in a rapid and severe decline in ringtails' population size in the last three decades. Main Conclusions Forecasted increases in temperature and heatwaves threaten the collapse of rain forest ringtail possums by 2050, with populations falling below viability thresholds within three decades."
1,"This study deals with the fanning systems and socio-economic impacts of implemented climate change support-policies to 27 farmer respondents in Barangay Carig Norte, Tuguegarao City. Primary data were gathered through a systematic interview with the respondents using a questionnaire, cratfted based on the ultimate goals of the National Climate Change Action Plan. Existing records, assessment and project reports of the local government were also used as basis of the analysis. Based on interviews and secondary data, there was no clear indication that climate change support policies were implemented in accordance with the objectives set by the national government. In addtion, there were no concrete climate change support-policies yet implemented but there are initiatives and fragmented efforts, policies and projects that address the issues of droughts and flooding Examples of the fragmented support projects implemented to address climate change are free use of water pump and provision of fuel allowance during drought. The crop insurance for calamities is yet to be implemented."
1,"Climate change has played a crucial role in the subrogation of Chinese dynasties. In particular, the Ming-Qing transition coincided with the rapid decrease in precipitation and the sharp deterioration of agroecological conditions in northern China under the cold conditions brought on by the Little Ice Age. Here, we present a new precipitation reconstruction (June-April) for northern Chinese Loess Plateau since 1590 CE. The reconstruction was derived from a tree-ring width chronology of Platycladus orientalis, and made it possible to quantitatively assess the period of megadroughts during the late Ming Dynasty, with high resolution. Our analysis showed that these extreme drought events have been unprecedented in China for the last 500 years, and precipitation variation could be linked to ENSO activities. The environmental imbalance caused by these megadroughts magnified the negative impacts of the climate on agriculture and society, an important reason for considering these phenomena as catalysts for the demise of the Ming Dynasty."
1,"In Italy extreme cities and territories occur at the extremities of lagoons, coastlines, and river deltas, in hydraulically reclaimed and hydrogeologically instable areas, and those where the water supply network has been placed underground, channeled into piping, or removed altogether. These areas are now increasingly subject to natural calamities and extreme weather conditions, and the consequences of climate change and the fragility of the more and more impermeable and urbanized land surface are clearly evident. Isotropic territories are characterized by weak hierarchization of infrastructure and settlement. The metropolitan area of Venice, aptly described as a diffuse city (citta diffusa), and other diffusely organized territories characterized by settlement dispersion are good examples of this phenomenon. This article reviews recent research at the University IUAV of Venice in a study on climate change and water forms, a project in which the profound relations between water networks, the geological nature of the terrain, forms of urbanization, and energy saving are tested out. The study of the territories of the Venetian metropolitan area provides a series of initial working hypotheses as to how the ongoing environmental emergency can become an opportunity for a development project of the city and the territory, capable of structuring its various parts differently."
1,"Arctic marine ecosystems are often assumed to be highly vulnerable to ongoing climate change, and are expected to undergo significant shifts in structure and function. Community shifts in benthic fauna are likely to result from changes in key physicochemical drivers, such as ocean warming, but there is little ecological data on most Arctic species to support any specific predictions as to how vulnerable they are, or how future communities may be structured. We used a species distribution modeling approach (MaxEnt) to project changes over the 21st century in suitable habitat area for different species of benthic fauna by combining presence observations from the OBIS database with environmental data from a coupled climate-ocean model (SINMOD). Projected mean % habitat losses over taxonomic groups were small (0-11%), and no significant differences were found between Arctic, boreal, or Arcto-boreal groups, or between calcifying and non-calcifying groups. However, suitable habitat areas for 14 of 78 taxa were projected a change by over 20%, and several of these taxa are characteristic and/or habitat-forming fauna on some Arctic shelves, suggesting a potential for significant ecosystem impacts. These results highlight the weakness of general statements regarding vulnerability of taxa on biogeographic or presumed physiological grounds, and suggest that more basic biological data on Arctic taxa are needed for improved projections of ecosystem responses to climate change."
1,"Pakistan relies greatly on the water of the Upper Indus basin (UIB) for its vast agriculture in the Indus Basin Irrigation System (IBIS). There are already concerns about the extent of unsustainable water use in the IBIS, particularly of groundwater, and these concerns are likely to increase in the future due to population increase and associated increased demand for food. In addition, climate change, continuing reservoir sedimentation in the major dams, and other impacts on water supply and demand are likely to have an impact on the practical implementation of the landmark inter-provincial Water Apportionment Accord (the Accord), which governs surface water allocation in the IBIS. There is, therefore, a need to assess the sustainability of irrigation in light of the potential variations of water availability in the basin under a series of plausible climate change and reservoir sedimentation scenarios. In this paper, we examine the impact of continuing reservoir sedimentation and climate change by 2050 on the water balance of canal commands in the IBIS. Firstly, we used a river system model, the first to include water management rules as in the Accord, to propagate climate induced changes on flows in the UIB and their impact on IBIS flow regulation and canal deliveries (I-cw) with and without reservoir sedimentation. Secondly, we used a selection of General Circulation Models (GCMs) that showed skill at simulating the local climate of the IBIS to assess the projected changes to rainfall (P-n) and evapotranspiration (ETa). The analysis revealed that water balances in IBIS canal command areas are more significantly affected by changed inflows from the UIB than by localised climate induced changes (i.e. P-n and ETa). Continuing reservoir sedimentation in the dams to 2050 will diminish the capacity of the system to store flows during the wet summer Kharif season for its later release in the dry winter Rabi season. This will decrease the supply of I-cw in the Rabi season to the downstream IBIS areas in Sindh and Balochistan provinces, and potentially increase supplies in the Kharif season. The impact of reservoir sedimentation on the Rabi water supply (33 mm (13%) decrease in median I-cw, equivalent to 1.89 km(3)), is greater than the impact of projected localised climate change within the IBIS (2 mm (12%) decrease in median P-n, equivalent to 0.13 km(3)). Sedimentation combined with climate change decreases the median I-cw by 51 mm (20%, equivalent to 2.91 km(3)) in Rabi in the low flow scenario and increases it by 48 mm (8%, equivalent to 2.72 km(3)) in Kharif in the high flow scenario. In the upstream Punjab province, however, reservoir sedimentation will have limited impact by 2050 due to lower ETa in Rabi and the availability of groundwater. Continued reservoir sedimentation beyond 2050 will also affect Punjab, again diminishing the supply of I-cw in Rabi and increasing it in Kharif. Concurrently, declining I-cw could lead to a substantial reduction in crop areas in the Rabi season. To avoid this undesirable scenario, Pakistan needs to explore both demand and supply management options to achieve food and economic security, as well as controlling sedimentation rates in reservoirs."
1,"In this study, we identified the current distribution of five globally distributed invasive Hemidactylus species and predicted their potential and future distribution using species distribution models based on climate and elevation data. These species included H. brookii, H. frenatus, H. garnotii, H. mabouia, and H. turcicus. We show that many regions with tropical and Mediterranean climates are suitable for most of these species. However, their current and potential distributions suggest that climate is not the only limiting factor. We hypothesize that climatic conditions may affect competition and other interactions resulting in a segregated distribution of the studied Hemidactylus species. As an effect of global climate change it is likely that H. brookii will expand its range to areas that are currently colonized by H. mabouia and/or H. frenatus, while H. turcicus is likely to expand its range to areas that are not yet invaded by any Hemidactylus species. The role of species interactions in the range expansion of these five Hemidactylus species still remains poorly understood, but could be of major importance in understanding and managing these invasive species."
1,"The Texas High Plains (THP) region contributes to about 25% of the US cotton production. Dwindling groundwater resources in the underlying Ogallala aquifer, future climate variability and frequent occurrences of droughts are major concerns for cotton production in this region. Assessing the impacts of climate change on cotton production enables development and evaluation of irrigation strategies for efficient utilization of groundwater resources in this region. In this study, the CROPGRO-Cotton module within the Cropping System Model (CSM) that is distributed with the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) was evaluated for the THP region using measured data from cotton water use efficiency experiments at Halfway over a period of four years (2010-2013). Simulated seed cotton yield matched closely with observed yield during model calibration (average percent error of 0.1) and validation (average percent error of 6.5). The evaluated model was able to accurately simulate seed cotton yield under various irrigation strategies over the four growing seasons. The evaluated CROPGRO-Cotton model was later used to simulate the seed cotton yield under historic (1971-2000) and future (2041-2070) climate scenarios projected by three climate models. On an average, when compared to historic seed cotton yield, simulated future seed cotton yield across the THP decreased within a range of 4-17% when carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration was assumed to be constant at the current level (380 ppm) under three climatic model scenarios. In contrast, when the CO2 concentration was assumed to increase from 493 ppm (in year 2041) to 635 ppm (in year 2070) according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) A2 emission scenario, the simulated future average seed cotton yield in the THP region increased within a range of 14-29% as compared to historic average yield. When the irrigation amount was reduced by 40% (from 100% to 60%), the average (2041-2070) seed cotton yield decreased by 37% and 39% under the constant and increasing CO2 concentration scenarios, respectively. These results imply that cotton is sensitive to atmospheric CO2 concentrations, and cotton production in the THP could potentially withstand the effects of future climate variability under moderate increases in CO2 levels if irrigation water availability remains at current levels.

1,"Climate change has been the main environmental challenge in recent years. In this research, the impact of climate change on the Arjan Wetland, Iran, has been investigated. The global climate models of canESM2 and hadGEM2 were used to predict the air temperature and precipitation for 2025-2066 in scenarios of RCP 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5. Temperature and precipitation data were downscaled using SDSM and LARS-WG software, respectively. Then, the wetland area was measured by processing the Landsat satellite images using the MNDWI algorithm. Forecast data were applied to estimate the wetland area for 2025-2066 and the scPDSI drought index. The results indicate that the estimated areas of the future period will slightly decrease; as a result, 90% of the areas in the years 2045-2066 are less than 800 hectares, and more than1100 hectares have not been dried in these years. The reduction of the area compared to the observation period is due to climate change and it shows the Arjan wetland is going towards drought. In 2036-2039, 2042, 2052, 2056-2058, and 2062, severe droughts will occur in wetlands under three scenarios with an area of less than 200 ha. According to the climate projections, the wetland will experience severe wet years in 2025, 2044, and 2045. So, the wetlands are probably less threatened by climate change than anticipated prior to this study."
1,"Coastal sea-level acceleration is analyzed using all of the world's high-quality tide gauge recordings with lengths of at least 75 years that extend through 2017-19. Earlier studies have demonstrated that tide gauge recordings of at least 75 years in length are required to reduce the effects of multidecadal variations on acceleration. There are 149 tide gauge records that meet the criteria. Mean and median sea-level accelerations based on these gauges were 0.0128 +/- 0.0064 min/y(2) and 0.0126 +/- 0.0080 mm/y(2), respectively, both at the statistically significant 95% confidence level. The mean acceleration is larger than that of earlier studies that analyzed fewer gauges or considered record lengths shorter than 75 years."
1,"Variability and availability of water resources under changing environment in a regional scale have been hot topics in recent years, due to the vulnerability of water resources associated with social and economic development. In this paper, four subbasins in the Dongjiang basin with a significant land use change were selected as case study. Runoffs of the four subbasins were simulated using the SCS monthly model to identify the quantitative impacts of land use and climate change. The results showed that (1), in the Dongjiang basin, temperature increased significantly, evaporation and sunlight decreased strongly, while precipitation showed a nonsignificant increase; (2) since the 1980s, land uses in the Dongjiang basin have experienced a significant change with a prominent increase in urban areas, a moderate increase in farmlands, and a great decrease in forest areas; (3) the SCS monthly model performed well in the four subbasins giving that the more significant land use change in each subbasin, the more runoff change correspondingly; (4) overall, runoff change was contributed half and half by climate change and human activities, respectively, in all the subbasins, in which about 20%similar to 30% change was contributed by land use change."
1,"News media influence how climate change is represented, understood, and discussed in the public sphere. To date, media and climate change research has primarily focused on Annex I countries, or treated non-Annex I countries as a homogenous bloc, despite the global nature of climate change and its geographically uneven impacts. This study uses a mixed-method approach, combining machine learning (topic modeling), econometrics, and qualitative analyses, to investigate newspaper coverage of climate change in 26 non-Annex I countries. We compiled a dataset of 95 216 news articles (dated between 2010 and 2020 from 50 sources) in 26 lower-middle and upper-middle income non-Annex I countries. In line with previous research results, we find that most common topics represented are international governance of climate change, the economics of energy transitions, and the impacts of climate change. Advancing current research understanding, we also demonstrate heterogeneity in coverage between non-Annex I countries and discover that a country's vulnerability to climate change is positively associated with the diversity of topics (based on an article-level entropy index) portrayed by its domestic news media outlets."
1,"Effects of ocean acidification and warming on marine primary producers can be modulated by other environmental factors, such as levels of nutrients and light. Here, we investigated the interactive effects of five oceanic environmental drivers (CO2, temperature, light, dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphate) on the growth rate, particulate organic carbon (POC) and particulate inorganic carbon (PIC) quotas of the cosmopolitan coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi. The population growth rate increased with increasing temperature (16 to 20 degrees C) and light intensities (60 to 240 mu mol photons m(-2) S-1) but decreased with elevated pCO(2) concentrations (370 to 960 mu atm) and reduced availability of nitrate (24.3 to 7.8 mu mol L-1) and phosphate (1.5 to 0.5 mu mol L-1). POC quotas were predominantly enhanced by the combined effects of increased pCO(2) and decreased availability of phosphate. PIC quotas increased with decreased availability of nitrate and phosphate. Our results show that concurrent changes in nutrient concentrations and pCO(2) levels predominantly affected the growth, photosynthetic carbon fixation and calcification of E. huxleyi and imply that plastic responses to progressive ocean acidification, warming, and decreasing availability of nitrate and phosphate reduce the population growth rate while increasing cellular quotas of particulate organic and inorganic carbon of E. huxleyi, ultimately affecting coccolithophore-related ecological and biogeochemical processes."
1,"Invasive mammals are an ongoing threat at many seabird breeding locations, while impacts from climate change can occur over broad time scales. Combining management strategies for invasive mammal and climate change impacts is important for mitigating current threats and maximizing seabird survival into the future. We assessed all 713 islands with threatened seabirds for conservation importance, immediate benefits of three invasive mammal management actions, and risk of climate-change related flooding. Preventing invasions on the 397 islands without invasive mammals could benefit 72 seabird species. Invasive mammal eradication or localized action on 249 and 67 islands could benefit 71 and 46 seabird species, respectively. The long-term risk of flooding on the 713 islands was low (69%). Low-risk islands were concentrated where eradications or localized action were highlighted (75% and 100% of islands, respectively). These results inform management feasibility assessments and highlight rare opportunities to make significant contributions to seabird conservation."
1,"Aims: To examine the perceived knowledge, attitudes and beliefs regarding climate change and health of academic faculty and students in programmes for health professionals and to identify barriers/facilitators to and resources required for curriculum integration.Design: Cross-sectional survey eliciting quantitative and open-ended responses.Methods: A 22-question survey to assess climate-health knowledge/attitudes/beliefs was distributed to all students and faculty (n = 224) at one academic institution in the United States. Open-ended questions addressed barriers, facilitators and required resources. Descriptive statistics are reported, and thematic analysis was used to identify themes from open-ended responses.Results: Response rate was 15%. Most respondents (76%) were between 20 and 34 years old. The majority were from nursing (39%), occupational therapy (13%) and communication speech disorders (12.5%). Most respondents perceived climate change as relevant to direct patient care (78%) and believed that it is impacting the health of individuals (86%) and should be integrated into curricula (89%). Yet, most (60%) reported modest to no knowledge about the health impacts. Faculty reported little to no comfort teaching climate change and health concepts (76%). Open-ended responses identified student/faculty receptivity and professional/clinical relevance as important facilitators of successful integration. Barriers included intensity of programmes; time and competing curricular priorities; and a lack of faculty expertise, resources, institutional and professional commitment.Conclusions: Most health professions students and faculty indicated that educating future health professionals about climate change and health is important, but existing barriers must be addressed.Impact: This study addressed student and faculty perceptions of integrating climate change and health into health professions curricula. Discipline-specific and interprofessional educational approaches are necessary to optimize future health professionals' efforts to prevent and mitigate climate change impacts for at-risk patients, communities and populations."
1,"Species distribution models (SDMs) are widely used to forecast changes in the spatial distributions of species and communities in response to climate change. However, spatial autocorrelation (SA) is rarely accounted for in these models, despite its ubiquity in broad-scale ecological data. While spatial autocorrelation in model residuals is known to result in biased parameter estimates and the inflation of type I errors, the influence of unmodeled SA on species' range forecasts is poorly understood. Here we quantify how accounting for SA in SDMs influences the magnitude of range shift forecasts produced by SDMs for multiple climate change scenarios. SDMs were fitted to simulated data with a known autocorrelation structure, and to field observations of three mangrove communities from northern Australia displaying strong spatial autocorrelation. Three modeling approaches were implemented: environment-only models (most frequently applied in species' range forecasts), and two approaches that incorporate SA; autologistic models and residuals autocovariate (RAC) models. Differences in forecasts among modeling approaches and climate scenarios were quantified. While all model predictions at the current time closely matched that of the actual current distribution of the mangrove communities, under the climate change scenarios environment-only models forecast substantially greater range shifts than models incorporating SA. Furthermore, the magnitude of these differences intensified with increasing increments of climate change across the scenarios. When models do not account for SA, forecasts of species' range shifts indicate more extreme impacts of climate change, compared to models that explicitly account for SA. Therefore, where biological or population processes induce substantial autocorrelation in the distribution of organisms, and this is not modeled, model predictions will be inaccurate. These results have global importance for conservation efforts as inaccurate forecasts lead to ineffective prioritization of conservation activities and potentially to avoidable species extinctions."
1,"Marine ecosystems, biodiversity, and fisheries are under strain worldwide due to global changes including climate warming and demographic pressure. To address this issue, many scientists and stakeholders advocate the use of an ecosystem approach for fisheries that integrates the numerous ecological and economic complexities at play rather than focusing on the management of individual target species. However, the operationalization of such an ecosystem approach remains challenging, especially from a bio-economic standpoint. Here, to address this issue, we propose a model of intermediate complexity (MICE) relying on multi-species, multi-fleet, and resource-based dynamics. Climate change effects are incorporated through an envelope model for the biological growth of fish species as a function of sea surface temperature. The model is calibrated for the small-scale fishery in French Guiana using a time series of fish landings and fishing effort from 2006 to 2018. From the calibrated model, a predictive fishing effort projection and RCP climate scenarios derived from IPCC, we explore the ecosystem dynamics and the fishery production at the horizon 2100. Our results demonstrate the long-term detrimental impact of both climate change and ecological competition on fish biodiversity. The prognosis is particularly catastrophic under the most pessimistic climate scenario, with a potential collapse of both biomass targeted species and fishing activity by 2100."
1,"Introduction Environmental contaminants are groups of unwanted, ubiquitous chemicals, found in food via weathering of the earth's crust, combustion (natural or anthropogenic), industrial uses or as unwanted bi-products of manufacturing processes. Evidence suggests that the climate is becoming hotter and more variable, resulting in rising sea levels, warmer oceans, more forest fires and more extreme events such as floods, storms, cyclones, droughts and landslips. Methods Sources of environmental contaminants into food or feeds are described. The impact of climate change on the formation, distribution or uptake of these contaminants is addressed with reference to the scientific literature. Results Climate change may result in increased atmospheric release and mobilization of environmental contaminants, an increased rate of mercury methylation, changes in biological systems and increased applications of contaminants to soils and crops from water re-use. Conversely, climate change policies, to reduce carbon emissions, are driving energy efficiencies, leading to reduced emissions of dioxins, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon and heavy metals. Conclusion Climate change is likely to increase human exposure to arsenic, cadmium, lead, mercury, dioxins, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and polychlorinated biphenyls where food and feeds may be contaminated by forest fires, water re-use or increased methylation (mercury only). The extent of this change is yet to be quantified."
1,"To mitigate climate change, city authorities are developing policies in areas such as transportation, housing and energy use, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In addition to their effects on greenhouse gas emissions, these policies are likely to have consequences for the wellbeing of their populations for example through changes in opportunities to take physical exercise. In order to explore the potential consequences for wellbeing, we first explore what 'wellbeing' is and how it can be operationalized for urban planners. In this paper, we illustrate how wellbeing can be divided into objective and subjective aspects which can be measured quantitatively; our review of measures informs the development of a theoretical model linking wellbeing to policies which cities use to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Finally, we discuss the extent to which the links proposed in the conceptual model are supported by the literature and how cities can assess wellbeing implications of policies."
1,"Warming and precipitation reduction have been concurrent throughout this century in most temperate regions (e.g., Northeast China) and have increased drought risk to the growth, migration, or mortality of tree seedlings. Coexisting tree species with different functional traits in temperate forests may have inconsistent responses to both warming and decreased precipitation, which could result in a species distribution shift and change in community dynamics. Unfortunately, little is known about the growth and physiological responses of coexisting species to the changes in these two meteorological elements. We selected two coexisting species in a temperate secondary forest of Northeast China: Quercus mongolica Fischer ex Ledebour (drought-tolerant species) and Fraxinus mandschurica Rupr. (drought-intolerant species), and performed an experiment under strictly controlled conditions simulating the predicted warming (+2 degrees C, +4 degrees C) and precipitation reduction (-30%) compared with current conditions and analyzed the growth and physiology of seedlings. The results showed that compared with the control, warming (including +2 degrees C and +4 degrees C) increased the specific area weight and total biomass of F. mandschurica seedlings. These were caused by the increases in foliar N content, the activity of the PSII reaction center, and chlorophyll content. A 2 degrees C increase in temperature and reduced precipitation enhanced root biomass of Q. mongolica, resulting from root length increase. To absorb water in drier soil, seedlings of both species had more negative water potential under the interaction between +4 degrees C and precipitation reduction. Our results demonstrate that drought-tolerant species such as Q. mongolica will adapt to the future drier conditions with the co-occurrence of warming and precipitation reduction, while drought-intolerant species will accommodate warmer environments."
1,"Local effects on the rates of spread of mangrove and associated epifauna were modeled for the Indian River Lagoon, Florida, USA. The model divided the 200-km-long lagoon into 157,330 cells. Data from a hydrodynamic model were used to generate current vectors for each cell at 10-min intervals. Each cell was assigned a habitat type, and releases or recruitment of mangrove propagules or epifauna larvae were based on the suitability of these habitats. Multiple species were included in the model, each with its own life-history parameters. All individuals were followed over 8 years or until mortality occurred. Adults could reproduce and release new larvae or propagules. The mean rates of spread predicted by the model were < 1 km year(-1) for all species, which were less than the 2 km year(-1) predicted for mangroves along this coast. Spread rates were also found to differ among the five inlet source sites used in the model. Epifaunal invertebrate populations spread at similar rates, but spread more rapidly from mangrove habitats than from dock habitats. These results demonstrate that local differences in hydrodynamics and habitat distributions influence the broader regional rates of spread likely to occur with climate change."
1,"Large boulders, ca. 10m in diameter or more, commonly linger in Himalayan river channels. In many cases, their lithology is consistent with source areas located more than 10 km upstream, suggesting long transport distances. The mechanisms and timing of exotic boulder emplacement are poorly constrained, but their presence hints at processes that are relevant for landscape evolution and geohazard assessments in mountainous regions. We surveyed river reaches of the Trishuli and Sunkoshi, two trans-Himalayan rivers in central Nepal, to improve our understanding of the processes responsible for exotic boulder transport and the timing of emplacement. Boulder size and channel hydraulic geometry were used to constrain paleo-flood discharge assuming turbulent, Newtonian fluid flow conditions, and boulder exposure ages were determined using cosmogenic nuclide exposure dating. Modeled discharges required for boulder transport of ca. 10(3) to 10(5) m(3) s(-1) exceed typical monsoonal floods in these river reaches. Exposure ages range between ca. 1.5 and 13.5 ka with a clustering of ages around 4.5 and 5.5 ka in both studied valleys. This later period is coeval with a broader weakening of the Indian summer monsoon and glacial retreat after the Early Holocene Climatic Optimum (EHCO), suggesting glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) as a possible cause for boulder transport. We, therefore, propose that exceptional outburst events in the central Himalayan range could be modulated by climate and occur in the wake of transitions to drier climates leading to glacier retreat rather than during wetter periods. Furthermore, the old ages and prolonged preservation of these large boulders in or near the active channels shows that these infrequent events have long-lasting consequences on valley bottoms and channel morphology. Overall, this study sheds light on the possible coupling between large and infrequent events and bedrock incision patterns in Himalayan rivers with broader implications for landscape evolution."
1,"ObjectiveThis systematic review aimed to investigate the epidemiological data about meteorological factors and climate change (CC) impact on asthma.Data sourcesA search was performed using three databases (Web of Science, Science Direct, and MEDLINE) for all relevant studies published from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2022.Study selectionsThis systematic review complied with the PRISMA document's requirements, including studies related to meteorological factors and CC impact on asthma. The search included studies published in English or French language, and was based on title, abstract, and complete text. Documents not meeting inclusion requirements were excluded.ResultsWe identified 18 studies published in the last five years that were eligible for inclusion in this review. We found that these studies concerned European, Asian, American, and Oceanic cities. Extreme variations in temperature, humidity, wind speed, exceptional incidents like hurricanes, cold and heat waves, and seasonal shifts were strongly correlated with the worsening of asthmatic symptoms, particularly in childhood. In addition, excessive concentrations of air pollutants and aeroallergens were linked to pediatric asthma emergency hospital admissions.ConclusionsA significant association between the consequences of CC and asthma in adults particularly in children has been demonstrated. Future research should quantify the impact of global change in climate regarding the aeroallergens' distribution in terms of geography and time. It is also necessary to research the impact of air pollution on asthmatic health, like sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), and particles having an aerodynamic diameter lower than 2.5 mu m (PM2.5)."

1,"It is critical that we understand the effects of climate change on natural systems if we ever hope to predict or mitigate consequent changes in diversity and ecosystem function. In order to identify coherent fingerprints' of climate change across Earth's terrestrial and marine ecosystems, various reviews have been conducted to synthesize studies of climate change impacts on individual species, assemblages and systems. These reviews help to make information about climate change impacts accessible for researchers as well as for the general public and policymakers. As such, these reviews can be highly influential in setting the direction of policy and research. Unfortunately, due to limited data availability, the majority of reviews of climate change impacts suffer from severe taxonomic and geographic biases. In particular, tropical and marine systems are grossly underrepresented, as are plants and endothermic animals. These biases may preclude a comprehensive understanding of how climate change is affecting Earth's natural systems at a global scale. In order to advance our understanding of climate change impacts on species and ecosystems, we need to first assess the types of data that are and are not available and then correct these biases through directed studies and initiatives."
0,"The environmental importance of front gardens is examined in the context of climate change. Domestic front gardens help to absorb carbon dioxide, soak up rainfall and thus reduce flooding risks, provide open spaces for pleasant townscapes, protect biodiversity reserves and help conserve energy through shade and shelter. The continuing loss of front gardens is a result of increasing car ownership, off-street parking pressures, changes in garden fashion, wider lifestyle changes and perhaps also the absence in some cultures of any garden tradition. At a time of climatic uncertainty there are many positive ways in which a multi-purpose approach to front gardens can allow parking while retaining a green garden. The planning system is needed to ensure national awareness of the environmental importance of front gardens. The significance of their increasing loss and a multiple-use approach to alleviate the problems caused by current trends are discussed."
1,"Ocean acidification has been proposed as a major threat for marine biodiversity. Hendriks et al. [Hendriks, I.E., Duarte, C.M., Alvarez, M., 2010. Vulnerability of marine biodiversity to ocean acidification: a meta-analysis. Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science, doi:10.1016/j.ecss.2009.11.022.] proposed an alternative view and suggested, based on a meta-analysis, that marine biota may be far more resistant to ocean acidification than hitherto believed. However, such a meta-analytical approach can mask more subtle features, for example differing sensitivities during the life-cycle of an organism. Using a similar metric on an echinoderm database, we show that key bottlenecks present in the life-cycle (e.g. larvae being more vulnerable than adults) and responsible for driving the whole species response may be hidden in a global meta-analysis. Our data illustrate that any ecological meta-analysis should be hypothesis driven, taking into account the complexity of biological systems, including all life-cycle stages and key biological processes. Available data allow us to conclude that near-future ocean acidification can/will have dramatic negative impact on some marine species, including echinoderms, with likely consequences at the ecosystem level.

1,"Tropical cyclones (also known as hurricanes and typhoons) are now believed to be an important component of the Earth's climate system(1-3). In particular, by vigorously mixing the upper ocean, they can affect the ocean's heat uptake, poleward heat transport, and hence global temperatures. Changes in the distribution and frequency of tropical cyclones could therefore become an important element of the climate response to global warming. A potential analogue to modern greenhouse conditions, the climate of the early Pliocene epoch (approximately 5 to 3 million years ago) can provide important clues to this response. Here we describe a positive feedback between hurricanes and the upper-ocean circulation in the tropical Pacific Ocean that may have been essential for maintaining warm, El Nino-like conditions(4-6) during the early Pliocene. This feedback is based on the ability of hurricanes to warm water parcels that travel towards the Equator at shallow depths and then resurface in the eastern equatorial Pacific as part of the ocean's wind-driven circulation(7,8). In the present climate, very few hurricane tracks intersect the parcel trajectories; consequently, there is little heat exchange between waters at such depths and the surface. More frequent and/or stronger hurricanes in the central Pacific imply greater heating of the parcels, warmer temperatures in the eastern equatorial Pacific, warmer tropics and, in turn, even more hurricanes. Using a downscaling hurricane model(9,10), we show dramatic shifts in the tropical cyclone distribution for the early Pliocene that favour this feedback. Further calculations with a coupled climate model support our conclusions. The proposed feedback should be relevant to past equable climates and potentially to contemporary climate change."
1,"We use a mixed methods approach to examine high-altitude subsistence horticulturalists' responses to food insecurity caused by El Nino related droughts and frosts in the Papua New Guinea highlands. Customarily, high-altitude dwellers experiencing food insecurity migrate to lower-altitude food secure areas. We use quantitative data, such as household dietary diversity scores, household food insecurity access scores, and mid-upper arm circumference measures, to assess nutritional differences in two locations where migration has been documented in the past. We then turn to qualitative data gathered through participant observation, interviews, and focus group discussions, to examine why migration in the twenty-first century is not a viable option for the mitigation of food insecurity for high-altitude dwellers. Certain mitigation strategies are used, but impacts of development, such as resource extraction, monetization, conflict, and the erosion of collective social structures, have reshaped peoples' responses to climate change and food security."
0,"We know from land, energy and climate studies that the livestock sector plays a substantial role in deforestation, biodiversity loss and climate change. More recently it has become clear that livestock also significantly contributes to humanity's water footprint, water pollution and water scarcity. Jalava et al (Environ. Res. Lett. 9 074016) show that considerable water savings can be achieved by reducing the fraction of animal products in our diet. The findings are in line with a few earlier studies on water use in relation to diets. As yet, this insight has not been taken forward in national water policies, which focus on 'sustainable production' rather than 'sustainable consumption'. Most studies and practical efforts focus on increasing water-use efficiency in crop production (more crop per drop) and feed conversion efficiency in the livestock sector (more meat with less feed). Wateruse efficiency in the food system as a whole (more nutritional value per drop) remains a blind spot."
0,"Background: Tropical trees undergo severe stress through seasonal drought and flooding, and the ability of these species to respond may be a major factor in their survival in tropical ecosystems, particularly in relation to global climate change. Aquaporins are involved in the regulation of water flow and have been shown to be involved in drought response; they may therefore play a major adaptive role in these species. We describe genetic diversity in the PIP sub-family of the widespread gene family of Aquaporins in five Neotropical tree species covering four botanical families. Results: PIP Aquaporin subfamily genes were isolated, and their DNA sequence polymorphisms characterised in natural populations. Sequence data were analysed with statistical tests of standard neutral equilibrium and demographic scenarios simulated to compare with the observed results. Chloroplast SSRs were also used to test demographic transitions. Most gene fragments are highly polymorphic and display signatures of balancing selection or bottlenecks; chloroplast SSR markers have significant statistics that do not conform to expectations for population bottlenecks. Although not incompatible with a purely demographic scenario, the combination of all tests tends to favour a selective interpretation of extant gene diversity. Conclusions: Tropical tree PIP genes may generally undergo balancing selection, which may maintain high levels of genetic diversity at these loci. Genetic variation at PIP genes may represent a response to variable environmental conditions."
0,"Urbanization-induced atmospheric moisture changes, embodied as urban moisture island (UMI) and urban dry island (UDI) effects, are not as thoroughly understood as the urban heat island (UHI) effects, despite their significant influence on human comfort and well-being. This paper offers the first systematic review and quantitative meta-analysis of global urban-rural humidity contrasts, aiming to advance our comprehension of the mechanisms, intensity, patterns, and implications of urban humidity changes. The meta-analysis compiles observational data from 34 studies across 33 cities. It reveals that mid-latitude cities predominantly exhibit moderate UMI and UDI effects, and cities with low mean annual precipitation and distinct dry/wet seasons, however, exhibit extreme UMI and UDI effects. The diurnal cycle analysis presents more pronounced UMI effects at night, largely due to increased evapotranspiration and delayed dewfall linked with UHI. On a seasonal scale, UDI effects dominate in spring, while UMI effects peak in winter for mid-latitude cities and in summer for low-latitude cities. In addition, city characteristics such as topography, morphology, and size significantly shape urban-rural humidity contrasts. Coastal cities are subject to sea-breeze circulation, importing moisture from sea to land, whereas mountainous cities can accumulate humidity and precipitation due to geographical barriers and vertical airflow. High-density urban areas generally experience heightened UMI effects due to restricted airflow and ventilation. Larger cities with higher populations contribute to increased UMI effects, particularly in winter, due to stronger anthropogenic moisture sources. This paper also discusses multi-dimensional humidity impacts and strategies for humidity-sensitive urban planning in the context of climate change. It identifies critical gaps in current research, paving the way for future exploration into urban humidity changes."
1,"Ocean acidification is predicted to have significant implications for marine calcifying organisms. However, little is known about the physiological responses of Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, to elevated partial pressure of atmospheric carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) under natural fluctuations associated with a farm environment. The present study evaluated the effect of two pCO(2) levels (i.e. ambient similar to 625 mu atm and elevated similar to 1432 mu atm) on the physiological processes and growth of C. gigas in in situ mesocosms that simulated the farm environment. Oysters were exposed for 30 days over a sensitive period during their production cycle when they are first exposed to natural coastal conditions. Despite this being a well-known bottleneck in production, it remains understudied with respect to climate change. Results showed that elevated pCO(2) levels decreased clearance rate, ingestion rate, absorption efficiency, and oxygen to nitrogen ratio, while increasing oxygen consumption and ammonia-N excretion rates. These physiological responses of oysters resulted in a reduction in energy available for growth (scope for growth). No mortality was observed in the control or elevated pCO(2) treatments, indicating that although oyster may survive future coastal acidification, the allocation of energy towards production within aquaculture systems will decrease in the future, affecting the culture of these economically important marine bivalves."
1,"Fisheries-based livelihood activities constitute an essential means of income and well-being for the majority living in coastal areas. This paper examines vulnerability of fisheries-based livelihoods caused by climate variability and change. It focuses on three small pelagic fishers' communities including Kipumbwi, Kilindoni, and Kilwa-Kivinje, along the Tanzanian coast, as a case study. Little research has been done on the effect of climate variability and change on the livelihoods of small-scale fishing communities in developing countries, particularly along the Tanzanian coast. In collecting data, questionnaire, focused group discussion and an interactive governance approach were used. Results showed that the natural vulnerability issues include, reduced catches, and strong winds. Economic vulnerability, mentioned lack of credit facilities. For social vulnerability, respondents mentioned an increased number of fishers and fishing vessels On the aspect of technology, respondents mentioned lack of modern fishing methods. As findings suggest, these vulnerability aspects, are possibly associated with anthropogenic factors such as illegal fishing, may not be related to climate change, but climate change may intensify them. The findings further showed that climate variability has negatively affected the fisheries on which fisher communities depend for income and for food security thus affecting their local economy. Climate change has negatively affected small pelagic fishers. The decline in fish catches and economic- unmatching changes in fish prices have negatively affected the fishing community's income, employment, and food security. The recommended means for reducing vulnerability include reducing taxes and levies, availability of facilities for reducing post-harvesting loss and availability of reliable markets."
1,"Accurately predicting the future distribution of species is crucial for understanding how species will response to global environmental change and for evaluating the effectiveness of current protected areas (PAs). Here, we assessed the effect of climate and land use change on the projected suitable habitats of Davidia involucrata Baill under different future scenarios using the following two types of models: (a) only climate covariates (climate SDMs) and (b) climate and land use covariates (full SDMs). We found that full SDMs perform significantly better than climate SDMs in terms of both AUC (p < .001) and TSS (p < .001) and also projected more suitable habitat than climate SDMs both in the whole study area and in its current suitable range, although D. involucrate is predicted to loss at least 26.96% of its suitable area under all future scenarios. Similarly, we found that these range contractions projected by climate SDMs would negate the effectiveness of current PAs to a greater extent relative to full SDMs. These results suggest that although D. involucrate is extremely vulnerability to future climate change, conservation intervention to manage habitat may be an effective option to offset some of the negative effects of a changing climate on D. involucrate and can improve the effectiveness of current PAs. Overall, this study highlights the necessity of integrating climate and land use change to project the future distribution of species."
1,"Rapid urbanization worldwide has significantly altered urban climates, creating a need to balance urban growth with thermal environmental quality for sustainable development. This study examines the relationship between land surface temperature (LST) and urban characteristics, particularly focusing on how green cover can mitigate urban heat and how air pollution can increase temperatures. Recognizing the predictive value of LST for urban heat island (UHI) intensity, we analyzed three distinct U.S. cities-Chicago, San Francisco, and Phoenix-each characterized by unique climate and urban planning features. This study investigates the relationship between atmospheric pollutants (SO2, NO2, CO, O3) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) with land surface temperature (LST) using regression and correlation analyses. The analysis aims to elucidate how changes in atmospheric pollutants and NDVI affect variations in land surface temperature. Regression analysis is employed to estimate the coefficients of independent variables and quantify their impact on LST. Correlation analysis assesses the linear relationships between variables, providing insights into their pairwise associations. The study also examines multicollinearity between independent variables to identify potential confounding factors. The results reveal significant associations between atmospheric pollutants, NDVI, and land surface temperature, contributing to our understanding of the environmental factors influencing LST dynamics and informing climate change mitigation strategies. The observed inconsistencies in correlations across cities highlight the importance of the local context in environmental studies. Understanding these variations can aid in developing tailored urban planning policies that consider unique city characteristics for more effective climate resilience. Furthermore, a positive association was consistently obtained between pollutants and LST, indicating that increased pollution levels contribute to higher surface temperatures across different urban settings."
1,"Construction sites continue to operate despite inclement weather, exposing workers to unpleasant working circumstances that can lead to various physical and mental health challenges. A thorough literature review yielded 21 challenges for hot weather conditions such as heat stroke, kidney disease, heat cramps, anxiety and depression, and 20 challenges for cold weather conditions like asthma, frostbite, musculoskeletal disorders and hallucination. Workers vulnerable to hot and cold weather based on demographic characteristics were identified. The study also provides 27 strategies to address the challenges experienced in hot and cold weather conditions. Some of these include ensuring that workers stay hydrated, scheduling sufficient rest periods and allowing workers to self-pace. The results of this study will help construction decision-makers and project managers understand the difficulties faced by a field workforce who labors in extreme working conditions on construction sites and will facilitate adoption of strategies that can prevent weather-related physical and mental health problems."
0,"The limited resources available for the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services call for prioritisation schemes. For instance, in the process of systematic conservation planning site selection is partly determined by efficiency gains. In this paper we present an alternative method for global spatial priority-setting based on ecological indicators, combined with social and economic conditions that influence the effectiveness of conservation, and measures for the long-term persistence of biodiversity. In the analysis the assumption made is that nature conservation should prioritize the effective maintenance of functional ecosystems that do not only provide the most ecosystem services but are also more likely to have a high adaptive capacity towards unavoidable environmental change. Furthermore, the effectiveness and permanence of conservation projects is tied to certain socioeconomic and political conditions that, as we suggest, should be evaluated as part of the conservation priority-setting process. We propose three new priority categories: eco-functionally wise (EcoWise), socioeconomically wise (SocioWise) and proactive allocation of conservation resources considering future climate change (ClimateWise) expressed as indices based on 16 different indicators. Analysing the combined effects of these three categories (EcoSocioClimateWise), in a spatially explicit way highlights the importance of tropical, subtropical but also some temperate and boreal forest areas all of which are characterized by high values of vegetation density, tree height and carbon storage. Our recommendations for policy makers prompt a shift in conservation planning towards advocating the use of ecological and socioeconomic indicators in combination with proxies for the vulnerability to future climate change impacts."
1,"Sturgeons are a group of iconic rheophilic fish whose populations worldwide are currently undergoing significant declines. The study investigates the impact of climate change and anthropogenic activities, particularly the Gab & ccaron;& iacute;kovo barrage system, on the survival and distribution of the sterlet, the last surviving sturgeon species in the Middle and Upper Danube River, specifically in the river part rkm 1708-1920 divided into three river sections: PT1 (Danube river part 1: rkm 1708-Gab & ccaron;& iacute;kovo impoundment), PT2 (Danube river part 2: rkm 1854-1920), and PT3 (Old Danube part 3: rkm 1850-1810). Between years 1996 and 2020, water temperatures in the Danube River (PT1, PT2) rose by over 1 degrees C on average, with the Old Danube (PT3) experiencing an alarming average increase of 3.5 degrees C (df = 2, F = 145.03, p = <2.2e-16). Consequently, suitable sterlet habitat (depth >= 4 m) in the Old Danube (PT3) now covers only 11% of its total area compared with 67% in PT1 and 75% in PT2 (flow rate = 1924.27 m(3 )s(-1)) due to altered flow regimes, water levels, and siltation. Sterlets are increasingly caught in an artificial channel below to the Gab & ccaron;& iacute;kovo Hydroelectric Power Plant (80%-90% of annual total catch), suggesting a shift in their distribution patterns. Conversely, there has been a notable decline in sterlet populations in other river sections, including a decrease in a section with moderate ecological status according to Water Frame Directive criteria. In light of these findings, the study proposes several mitigation measures to improve the status of the sterlet population in the area."
0,"The vast forests of Amazonia are a major focus of conservation initiatives by NGOs and governments. Nevertheless, the dynamics and geography of conservation action in this iconic region is poorly understood and, unlike scientific production, has never been systematically assessed. Here, we address this deficit through a survey of ongoing conservation NGO project sites in the Amazon region. We identified a total of 170 conservation NGOs that were implementing 378 projects at 518 sites across the breadth of the Amazon region. Project sites were associated with inhabited regions near major rivers, but away from major urban centres. In contrast to scientific research sites, there was a relatively high representation of conservation NGO project sites in the so called 'arc-of-deforestation'. As anticipated, conservation project sites were often situated within protected areas. Overall, our study shows that, as a sector, conservation NGOs have successfully implemented projects throughout the Amazon region and are seemingly well-placed to meet future conservation challenges. However, given the practical difficulties we encountered while collecting the data for this project, we strongly recommend the development of an online data platform for the entire Amazon region that would allow conservationists and scientists to share information, monitor governmental and non-governmental actions, and better coordinate conservation responses in the future."
0,"As climate change, biodiversity loss, and biological invaders are all on the rise, the significance of conservation and pest management initiatives cannot be stressed. Insect traps are frequently used in projects to discover and monitor insect populations, assign management and conservation strategies, and assess the effectiveness of treatment. This paper assesses the application of YOLOv5 for detecting insects in yellow sticky traps using images collected from insect traps in Portuguese tomato plantations, acquired under open field conditions. Furthermore, a sliding window approach was used to minimize insect detection duplicates in a non-complex way. This article also contributes to event forecasting in agriculture fields, such as diseases and pests outbreak, by obtaining insect-related metrics that can be further analyzed and combined with other data extracted from the crop fields, contributing to smart farming and precision agriculture. The proposed method achieved good results when compared to related works, reaching 94.4% for mAP_0.5, with a precision and recall of 88% and 91%, respectively, using YOLOv5x."
1,"Most climate change projections show important decreases in water availability in the Mediterranean region by the end of this century. We assess those main climate change impacts on water resources in three medium-sized catchments with varying climatic conditions in northeastern Spain. A combination of hydrological modelling and climate projections with B1 and A2 IPCC emission scenarios is performed to infer future streamflows. The largest reduction (34%) in mean streamflows (for 2076-2100) is expected in the headwaters of the two wettest catchments, while lower decreases (25% of mean value for 2076-2100) are expected in the drier one. In all three catchments, autumn and summer are the seasons with the most notable projected decreases in streamflow, of 50% and 30%, respectively. Thus, ecological flows in the study area might be noticeably influenced by climate change, especially in the headwaters of the wet catchments."
1,"A network of oak (Quercus robur L.) chronologies containing 49 sites and 635 single trees was analysed to identify weather variables affecting annual tree-ring increment dynamics in southern Sweden during 1860-2000. We analysed (1) the growth response of oak to non-extreme weather, and (2) the temporal and spatial patterns of regional growth anomalies (pointer years) and associated climatic extremes resolved on a monthly scale. Growth was controlled by precipitation in the current (June-July) and the previous growing season (August) in 48% and 22% of all sites, respectively. Temperature during July of the current year and August of the previous year was negatively correlated with growth in 29% and 43% of the sites, respectively. Growth was positively correlated with temperature in October of the previous season in 72% of the sites. The most extensive growth anomaly occurred in 1965 and was probably caused by intrusion of cold Arctic air masses into the region at the end of March that year. During climatically non-extreme years, oak growth is driven mostly by the dynamics of summer precipitation. Many of the negative growth anomalies, however, were associated with temperature extremes. Southern Swedish oak pointer years tend not to coincide with the pan-European oak pointer years."

In order to correlate climate change with different terrestrial impacts, the energy balance is explained highlighting the presence of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Results indicate that Mexican agriculture has suffered the negative impacts of this process in terms of climatic uncertainty and has caused, along with other factors, agricultural field emigration of thousands of rural people. Consequences of global climate change are accounted in terms of precipitation anomalies, water availability and reduction in agricultural productivity according to biological simulation under different climate scenarios. It is concluded that there is a need of action mechanisms and scientific questions to be answered through research."
1,"In steep terrain, forests play an important role as natural means of protection against natural hazards, such as rockfall. Due to climate warming, significant changes in the protection service of these forests have to be expected in future. Shifts of current to more drought adapted species may result in temporary or even irreversible losses in the reduction of rockfall risk provided by these forests. In this study, we assessed how the protective capacity against rockfall of a protection forest in the western part of the Valais in the Swiss Alps may change in future, by combining dynamic forest modelling with a quantitative risk analysis. Current and future forest development was modelled with the spatially explicit forest model TreeMig under a moderate (RCP4.5) and an extreme (RCP8.5) climate change scenario. The simulated forest scenarios were compared to ground-truth data from the current forest complex. We quantified the protective effect of the different forest scenarios based on the reduction of rockfall risk for people and infrastructure at the bottom of the slope. Rockfall risk was calculated on the basis of three-dimensional rockfall simulations. The forest simulations predicted a clear decrease in basal area of most of the currently occuring species (Fagus sylvatica, Picea abies, Larix decidua, and Abies alba) in future. The forest turned into a Quercus pubescens dominated forest, for both climate scenarios, mixed with Pinus sylvestris under RCP4.5. With climate warming, a clear increase in risk is expected for both climate change scenarios. In the long-term (> 100 years), a stabilization of risk, or even a slight decline may be expected due to an increase in biomass of the trees. The results of this study further indicate that regular forest interventions may promote regeneration and thus accelerate the shift in species distribution. Future research should explore into more details the long-term effect of different adaptive forest management strategies on the protection service of forests under climate change."
1,"This essay addresses the conservation issues facing mangroves in the Anthropocene, defined as the era of human domination over the world. We review the laws, policies, international agreements, and local actions that address the conservation of mangrove forests in the Neotropics and relate them to the Anthropocene. Collaboration between governments, non-governmental organizations, and communities that depend on mangroves for their livelihood will be critical in the Anthropocene. The essay also reviews recent developments in mangrove ecology and ecophysiology that enlighten how mangroves might respond to changes in temperature and rainfall, sea level rise, and other anthropogenic and natural disturbances. Mangroves in the Anthropocene will also face changes in their species composition given the current movement of mangroves species across continental barriers as a result of human activity. These trends will lead to novel mangrove forests and in some cases expand the range of mangroves worldwide. The solution to mangrove persistence in the Anthropocene is not to isolate mangroves from people, but to regulate interactions between mangroves and humans through effective management. We will also have to expand the scope of the ecological analysis of mangrove ecosystems to include the social forces converging on the mangroves through an analytical approach that has been termed Social Ecology."
1,"Ruminants are vital elements of the Holarctic ecosystem. Little is known, however, of the structure or biology of their parasite fauna, particularly in North America. Global warming, coupled with increasing human activity in the Arctic, requires enhanced international interdisciplinary efforts to better understand the many factors, including parasites, that influence the population health of caribou, reindeer, muskoxen and wild sheep. The discovery of an unusual new genus of protostrongylid lung nematode in muskoxen from the central Canadian Arctic is described, and the intricacies of the parasite's relationship with its muskoxen definitive hosts, its gastropod intermediate hosts and the arctic environment are discussed."
0,"Deforestation is a major environmental problem confronting countries in the Global South. In response to the high rate of deforestation, policymakers have over the years implemented a myriad of afforestation programmes. This study sought to assess the prospects and challenges of Ghana's Youth in Afforestation Programme. The data used for this study was collected from 60 recruits of the afforestation programme. The researchers also relied on institutional interviews and documents from relevant agencies. Overall, the results showed that the Youth in Afforestation Programme has enormous potentials in restoring Ghana's degraded forests and protecting existing ones. However, it is confronted with several challenges ranging from financial, logistical to political. The inability of the implementing agencies and other relevant stakeholders to address these challenges has reduced the programme to a mere rhetoric rather than serving as a tool for transforming the socio-economic and environmental frontiers of the Ghanaian society."
1,"The article reviews the issue of climate change and health in the Indian context. The importance of climate change leading to estimated loss of above 2.5 million DALYs in southeast Asia, mortality due to heat waves, and the importance of air quality related respiratory diseases, disasters due to excessive floods, malnutrition due to reduction in rice, maize and sorghum crops etc. Latest work undertaken in India, vis-a-vis current scenario and need for further work has been discussed. There is felt need of further studies on assessing the impact on dengue and chikungunya as the transmission dynamics of these diseases involve water availability, storage and life style, etc. Uncertainties and knowledge gaps identified in the studies undertaken so far have also been highlighted. As regards to vector borne diseases, there is a need to concentrate in the areas which are presently free from malaria and with use of best available tools of interventions in already disease endemic areas like northeastern states, the risk of climate change impacts can be minimized."
1,"Climate change poses a severe threat to global agricultural production and rural livelihoods, and since agriculture itself is a significant source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, it can also play an important role in climate change mitigation. This article investigates how farmers' social networks influence the adoption of on-farm mitigation strategies. More precisely, we use a network autocorrelation model to explore the relationship between a farmer's own mitigation behavior and the mitigation behavior and knowledge of his fellow farmers. The analysis is based on a regional case study in Switzerland and uses data obtained from personal network interviews combined with survey and census data of 50 farmers. Half of them are members of a local collective action initiative for agricultural climate change mitigation, while the others do not participate in the initiative. We find that, on average, farmers with a larger network adopt more mitigation measures, and furthermore, mitigation adoption is linked with the level of knowledge within farmers' networks. Indeed, the likelihood that non-members will adopt mitigation measures increases if they are closely associated with members of the collective action, suggesting a local spillover effect. It follows that strengthening knowledge exchange among farmers and supporting local farmers' initiatives can potentially contribute to the diffusion of agricultural climate change mitigation practices."
1,"Niche conservatism has been proposed as the mechanism driving speciation in temperate montane clades through range fragmentation during climatic oscillations. Thus, a negative relationship between speciation rates and niche width is expected. Here, we test this prediction using American zopherine beetles. Our phylogenetic analyses recovered two clades in addition to that of the genus Zopherus: the genera Verodes and Phloeodes, which originated most likely in the Eocene, and diversified during the Miocene and the Pliocene. The assessment of clade niche width in relation to clade diversity supported the proposition of narrow niches leading to a higher probability of range fragmentation during climatic oscillations, thus increasing speciation. Additionally, almost all current populations of Phloeodes and Verodes are located within regions that retained favourable climatic conditions across warm and cold Pleistocene periods, suggesting that dispersal limitation is a strong factor controlling clade distribution. In sum, our results suggest that (i) niche width is a major determinant of the probability of speciation in temperate montane clades, by controlling the probability of potential range fragmentation and (ii) dispersal limitation is also a major determinant of the speciation process, by increasing the fragmentation of realized ranges even when potential distributions are cyclically fused during climatic oscillations. When dispersal limitation is extreme, as in zopherine beetles, populations persist just in those areas that have retained suitable conditions during extremes of past climatic oscillations. Paradoxically, this relict condition confers zopherine beetles great resilience for facing future climate change."
1,"Mountain ecosystems will likely be affected by global warming during the 21st century, with substantial biodiversity loss predicted by species distribution models (SDMs). Depending on the geographic extent, elevation range, and spatial resolution of data used in making these models, different rates of habitat loss have been predicted, with associated risk of species extinction. Few coordinated across-scale comparisons have been made using data of different resolutions and geographic extents. Here, we assess whether climate change-induced habitat losses predicted at the European scale (10 x 10' grid cells) are also predicted from local-scale data and modeling (25 m x 25 m grid cells) in two regions of the Swiss Alps. We show that local-scale models predict persistence of suitable habitats in up to 100% of species that were predicted by a European-scale model to lose all their suitable habitats in the area. Proportion of habitat loss depends on climate change scenario and study area. We find good agreement between the mismatch in predictions between scales and the fine-grain elevation range within 10 x 10' cells. The greatest prediction discrepancy for alpine species occurs in the area with the largest nival zone. Our results suggest elevation range as the main driver for the observed prediction discrepancies. Local-scale projections may better reflect the possibility for species to track their climatic requirement toward higher elevations."
1,"Water is considered as the most critical resource for sustainable agricultural development worldwide. Irrigated areas will increase in forthcoming years, while fresh water supplies will be diverted from agriculture to meet the increasing demand of domestic use and industry. Furthermore, the efficiency of irrigation is very low, since less than 65 % of the applied water is actually used by the crops. The sustainable use of irrigation water is a priority for agriculture in arid areas. So, under scarcity conditions and climate change considerable effort has been devoted over time to introduce policies aiming to increase water efficiency based on the assertion that more can be achieved with less water through better management. Better management usually refers to improvement of water allocation and/or irrigation water efficiency. The former is closely related to adequate pricing, while the latter depends on the type of irrigation technology, environmental conditions and the scheduling of water application. Agricultural practices, such as soil management, irrigation and fertilizer application and disease and pest control are related with the sustainable water management in agriculture and protection of the environment. Socio-economic pressures and climate change impose restrictions to water allocated to agriculture. The adoption of sustainable water management in Mediterranean is not only a technological problem but involves many other considerations relative to social behavior of rural communities, the economic constrains, or the legal and institutional framework that may favor the adoption of some measures and not others. Sustainable water management in agriculture, which has a multi-functional role in Southern Europe, can be achieved by adopting improvements in irrigation application, soil and plant practices, water pricing, reuse of treated wastewater, farmers' participation in water management and capacity building.

1,"Negative plant-soil feedbacks can serve as a mechanism for plant species coexistence. Despite predicted changes in precipitation patterns due to climate change, little is known as to how the strength and direction of feedbacks change under differing soil moisture regimes. We performed a fully reciprocal greenhouse experiment where seedlings of two co-occurring Asclepias spp. (milkweed) were grown either with their own or the other species' microbial communities under high or low watering treatments. We found that seedlings of each species were smaller when exposed to conspecific relative to heterospecific soil biota, perhaps due to a build-up of specific soil pathogens. Importantly, this negative feedback diminished under reduced water-availability, and also in the absence of live soil organisms. Our findings suggest that the ability for plants to coexist may be fundamentally altered in areas that face increased drought."
1,"Climate change has caused a series of social, economic and environmental consequences both at global and regional scales, especially for the urbanized coastal areas in China. Sea level rise and extreme weather threaten human and property safety, as well as sustainable development in China's densely populated coastal areas; all those factors bring new challenges to costal management. This paper takes a typical coastal city, Xiamen City as a case to study the residents' cognition of climate change, and based on questionnaire survey in coastal communities to explore the strategy development dealing with the climate change under integrated coastal management (ICM) framework. The social cognition survey includes three aspects: knowledge of the climate change, perception of the impact of climate change and response to the climate change. The results showed that the resident's knowledge on climate change and its risk was still at a relatively low level on average. Among effects of climate change, temperature rise can be easily identified by people, while sea level rise is less known by residents. Facing climate change, if residents have plans reactively, we think their attitudes are positive, i.e. evacuation is seen as negative. It is delight that 69.6% residents' attitude to adapt climate change is positive. 42.0% of residents prefer protective measures rather than adjustment measures when facing climate change. Furthermore, we explored the primary factors that influence residents' cognition and selection preference on adapting measures through logistic regression. Our study suggests that public cognition significantly affect public participation on climate change and the community-based planning and management on climate change is urgently in need in the rapidly developing urbanization coastal areas, which will play an important role in integrated coastal management."
1,"Water management in cities commonly focuses on reducing the risk of flooding and ensuring water supply by improving infrastructure locally. The supply of water and the process of flooding are directly related to the hydraulic dynamics of the watershed, however, and tools are lacking to evaluate and visualize hazards and solutions at the larger watershed scale. This paper presents a spatial model that evaluates the roles of water infiltration capacities and flood risks in watershed where cities are established. Understanding these characteristics is essential for managing water in urban areas, since water infiltration is related to the rainwater that may arrive to the aquifer, and floods are among the biggest concerns in risk management. We used spatial categorical data for land use, slope, soil texture, elevation, and precipitation to create a model that yields graded areas with different potential infiltration capacities, indicating susceptibility to flooding. The model can generate scenarios considering changes in land use and climate change up to the year 2050. We tested this model in Mexico City, Sao Paulo and Buenos Aires, three of the largest Latin American cities with different type of watersheds but similarities in population and policymaking. We found that climate change will decrease the infiltration capacities in Sao Paulo, but in the other two cities it will increase. Change in land use is the key factor, however, in reducing infiltration capacities and increasing the risk of flooding in all three cities. The model is applicable to urban areas in other parts of the world. These types of spatial models should be used in cities to emphasize the importance of watershed dynamics in managing water for the future. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
1,"The availability of nitrogen (N) is crucial for both the productivity of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems globally. However, the overuse of artificial fertilizers and the energy required to fix nitrogen have pushed the global nitrogen cycle (N-cycle) past its safe operating limits, leading to severe nitrogen pollution and the production of significant amounts of greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O). The anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) mechanism can counteract the release of ammonium and N2O in many oxygen-limited situations, assisting in the restoration of the homeostasis of the Earth's N biogeochemistry. In this work, we looked into the characteristics of the anammox hotspots' distribution across various types of ecosystems worldwide. Anammox hotspots are present at diverse oxic-anoxic interfaces in terrestrial systems, and they are most prevalent at the oxic-anoxic transition zone in aquatic ecosystems. Based on the discovery of an anammox hotspot capable of oxidizing ammonium anoxically into N-2 without N2O by-product, we then designed an innovative concept and technical routes of nature-based anammox hotspot geoengineering for climate change, biodiversity loss, and efficient utilization of water resources. After 15 years of actual use, anammox hotspot geoengineering has proven to be effective in ensuring clean drinking water, regulating the climate, fostering plant and animal diversity, and enhancing long-term environmental quality. The sustainable biogeoengineering of anammox could be a workable natural remedy to resolve the conflicts between environmental pollution and food security connected to N management.

1,"The extreme temperature has become more frequent and intense due to global warming, particularly in dry regions, causing devastating impacts on humans and ecosystems. The transboundary Amu river basin (ARB) is the most vulnerable region in Central Asia (CA) to extreme weather linked to climate change. This study aimed to project warm and cold extremes in ARB for four Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5) and two time-horizons, 2020-2059 and 2060-2099, using daily maximum (T-max) and minimum temperature (T-min) simulations of global climate models (GCMs) of Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project phase six (CMIP6). Results revealed that the basin's west experiences more hot extremes and the east more cold extremes. Climate change would cause a significant increase in the annual mean of T-max and T-min. However, the increase in mean T-min would be much higher (5.0oC ) than the mean T-max (4.6oC ). It would cause an increase in the hot extremes and a decrease in the cold extremes in the basin. The higher increase in the hot extremes would be in the west, while the higher decrease in the cold extreme in the basin's east. The number of days above 40celcius would increase from 45 to 60 days in the basin's west and northwest compared to the historical period. The number of days below - 20celcius would decrease up to 45 days in the basin's east. Overall, the decrease in cold extremes would be much faster than the increase in hot extremes."
1,"Climate change affects the dynamics of vector-borne diseases. Culex pipiens Linnaeus is the main vector of West Nile fever, a widely distributed arbovirus, it is continuously increasing its distribution. Using a species distribution model, maps of suitable habitats of Cx. pipiens were generated for Chile in the current climate and three climate change scenarios, using global and regional georeferenced vector presence records as input, plus bioclimatic variables. Since this virus has not yet arrived in Chile, the purpose of this study is to anticipate potential risk areas and to prevent the establishment and spread of the virus. Cx. pipiens is widely distributed in Chile. The suitable habitats in Chile were concentrated mostly from 32 degrees to 35 degrees S, increasing in future scenarios up to 113 % in the northern zone and moving towards the mountains. This species conserves around 90 % of its niche in the future, and shows a reduction of 11.4 % in the severe climate change scenario. It is anticipated that Chile will experience an increase in the environmental suitability for Cx. pipiens moving from the Andes to the coastal zone throughout the country, mainly in the center-south. This will raise the risk of local virus transmission if the virus is introduced to the country via diverse routes."
1,"Thecosome pteropods are a dominant group of calcifying pelagic molluscs and an important component of the food web. In this study, we characterise spring pteropod distribution throughout the Mediterranean Sea, an understudied region for this common group of marine calcifying organisms. This semi-enclosed sea is rapidly changing under climatic and anthropogenic forcings. The presence of surface water biogeochemical gradients from the Atlantic Ocean/Gibraltar Strait to the Eastern Mediterranean Sea allowed us to investigate pteropod distribution and their ecological preferences. In the ultra-oligotrophic Eastern Mediterranean Sea, we found the mean upper 200 m pteropod standing stock of 2.13 ind. m- 3 was approximately 5x greater than the Western basin (mean 0.42 ind. m-3). Where standing stocks were high, pteropods appeared largely in the same family grouping belonging to Limacinidae. Temperature, O2 concentration, salinity, and aragonite saturation (ohm ar) explain 96 % of the observed variations in the community structure at the time of sampling, suggesting that pteropods might show a preference for environmental conditions with a lower energetic physiological demand. We also document that pteropods and planktonic foraminifera have an opposite geographical distribution in the Mediterranean Sea. Our findings indicate that in specific pelagic ultra-oligotrophic conditions, such as the Eastern Mediterranean Sea, different feeding strategies could play an important role in regulating calcifying zooplankton distribution."
1,"The Monitoring net of forest ecosystems in the least polluted areas of Lithuania was established during 1989-1992. The main aim of the study was to determine and predict the condition of Pine stands and their changes with respect to the regional variation of pollutant load and meteorology. Data on pine crown condition collected in Aukstaitija National Park for 19 years allowed analysing key factors responsible for changes in forest conditions on a regional scale in Lithuania. Our earlier investigation revealed that defoliation of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) is closely related to air concentrations and wet deposition of acidifying compounds. In the present study we would like to check the hypothesis that meteorological parameters could reduce negative effect of acidifying compounds and improve pine condition under the rapid climate change condition. The obtained results revealed that spring and summer precipitation and mean winter temperature were shown to be the key factors affecting defoliation. High wind speed also deteriorated pine crown condition. Recent warmer winter and autumn seasons, increasing humidity of vegetation and decreasing wind speed over the dormant period should increase tolerance of pine trees to phytotocic affects of air pollutants including surface ozone and acid deposition in north-eastern part of Lithuania in the near future."
1,"Recent studies have shown that climate stress may cause asynchronous changes between greenness and productivity, but the mechanism how greenness and productivity respond to drought remains unclear. The significant greening of vegetation in China has attracted worldwide attention; nevertheless, it is unclear whether large-scale greening will translate into productivity in the context of recent droughts. In this study, we used the vegetation index dataset to extract long-term trends in vegetation greenness and productivity from 1982 to 2018, and then chose the multi-scale Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) index to measure how vegetation greenness and productivity change in response to drought. The results show that significant vegetation greening did not cause a simultaneous increase in productivity during 1982-2018. Vegetation greenness and productivity trends were relatively consistent before 2000 and diverged after 2000, especially during the prolonged drought of 2000-2009. The opposite trend between greenness and productivity in humid ecosystems during drought periods mainly caused this trend difference. In humid ecosystems, short-term drought promotes vegetation greening, while long-term drought has no significant impact on greenness. However, the inhibitory effect of drought on productivity deepens with an increase in drought duration. Therefore, prolonged droughts offset vegetation greenness-induced gross primary productivity. We also found that prolonged drought causes a significant decrease in greenness but has little effect on productivity in arid ecosystems, possibly because vegetation productivity is more sensitive to soil water than atmospheric drought. Our results highlight the complexity of vegetation growth in the context of climate change. Furthermore, it is crucial to pay attention to the impact of climate stress on regional carbon sequestration functions, considering the significant carbon sink potential of forest areas in southern China."
1,"Accounting for over 70% of global water withdrawals, irrigation plays a crucial role in the development of agriculture. Irrigation water requirement (WIRR) will be influenced by climate change due to the alteration in soil water balances, evapotranspiration, physiology and phenology under global warming. This is particularly true for rice, a high water-consuming crop. Therefore, exploring the impact of climate change on rice WIRR is of great significance for the sustainable utilization of water resources and food security. This paper aims to investigate spatially and temporally the responses of rice WIRR to climate change in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River (MLRYR), which is one of the most important rice farming districts in China. With the help of the specially developed rice growing period calculation method and water balance model coupled with rice irrigation scheduling, the impacts of climate change on WIRR for early rice, late rice and single cropping rice during the historical (1961-2012) and future (2011-2100) periods were evaluated. Meanwhile, to consider the uncertainty from climate models in future projection, four GCMs under RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 emission scenarios from the 5th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) were employed as the input of the water balance model. The results indicate the following: (1) The days of growing period (DGP) for all three types of rice display shortened trends in historical and most future periods. However, in the middle region of the MLRYR, the DGP for early rice and late rice would increase by up to10 days in 2080s under RCP8.5 scenario. (2) Over the past 50 years, the WIRR significantly decreased by 1.58 and 2.10 mm yr(-1) for late rice and single cropping rice, respectively. While for early rice, the WIRR only slightly decreased by 0.13 mm yr(-1). (3) Projected future WIRR would increase for all three types of rice in the whole region under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios (up to 100 mm), but decrease for single cropping and late rice in the southeast region (up to 40mm). The results can provide beneficial reference and comprehensive information to understand the impact of climate change on the agricultural water balance and improve the regional strategy for water resource utilization and agricultural management in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.

1,"Flooding is a major environmental problem facing Anambra State of Nigeria, which also threatens food security in the state. To address this issue, continual flood vulnerability mapping exploring more efficient methods is needed to facilitate flood risk management in the state. The advantages of employing spatial information technologies such as Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) in flood vulnerability mapping has been widely documented; the limitations of employing GIS alone in effective vulnerability analysis have also been documented by researchers. To overcome these limitations, this study adopted the use of GIS and the integration of Interval Value Fuzzy Rough Number (IVFRN), Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL), and Analytical Network Process (ANP) method in vulnerability assessment of flood hazard. The result of the study shows that the state is very vulnerable to flood with 73% of the total area of the state lying between Very High and Medium vulnerable zones. The most vulnerable Local Government Area (LGA) in the State is Anambra West with 95% of the total area of the LGA lying between Very High and Medium vulnerable zones. Furthermore, the obtained values of (R) over tilde - (D ) over tilde show that Rainfall Intensity factor is the major cause of flood in the study area with the highest positive value of 1.55 and Soil factor is the major effect with the highest negative value of -0.93. The IVFRN-DEMATEL-ANP assessment model was validated using AUC-ROC method; an AUC value of 0.946 was obtained, this indicates that the model has excellent prediction accuracy. This study was able to establish the feasibility of integrating the IVFRN, DEMATEL and ANP methods in flood vulnerability assessment. It is recommended that the provision of adequate drainage systems should be prioritized to areas of high flood vulnerability index; to help mitigate flood hazards in the State. Also, strategic planning of infrastructures and emergency routes for moving people and key assets from vulnerable areas especially during the rainy season should be geospatial-based and systematic."
1,"Severe droughts are increasingly prevalent under global climate change, disrupting watershed hydrology and coastal nitrogen cycling. However, the specific effects of drought on nitrogen transport from land to sea and subsequent nitrogen dynamics remain inadequately understood. In this study, we evaluated the consequences of the 2020-2022 drought on nitrogen supply and N2O emissions in Xiamen Bay, Southeast China. The results showed that drought significantly reduced annual NH4N, NO2N, and NO3N concentrations in Xiamen Bay by 49.4 %, 32.1 %, and 40.3 %, respectively, compared with the pre-drought year of 2019. The decline in NH4N concentration was mainly attributed to reduced surface runoff across all seasons. NO3N and NO2N concentrations declined only during spring and summer, primarily due to increased potential evapotranspiration (PET) hindering nitrogen supply via groundwater and concurrently enhancing land denitrification. Annual N2O emission from Xiamen Bay decreased by 40.0 similar to 72.7 % during the drought, highly correlated with the decline in the concentrations of NO3N, DIN, and DTN (p < 0.001). Comparative analysis revealed that NO3N concentration exhibited consistent negative linear regressions with PET and declined as evaporative demand drought conditions worsened across Xiamen Bay, Sansha Bay, and Chesapeake Bay throughout 2010-2022. NH4N concentration showed a positive regression with river discharge in Xiamen Bay, but negative regressions in the other two bays. Our results indicates that drought reduces N2O emission primarily driven by nitrate substrate reduction in the bay. This study provides new insights for predicting coastal nitrogen dynamics and greenhouse gas emissions under global environmental change."
1,"Increasing ocean acidification combined with other impacts may cause changes in homeostatic mechanisms of intertidal invertebrates. Stressors do not act in isolation, and experimental work is needed to assess their synergistic potential. We evaluated the effect of exposure to multiple stressors on the survival, osmoregulation, metabolism, Q10, excretion, hepatosomatic index, and energy substrate oxidation on of the fiddler crab Leptuca thayeri (). Crabs were exposed to two pH values (7.0, 6.3) combined with temperatures (20, 25, 30, 35, 40 degrees C) and these pH values combined with salinities (10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 psu) during acute exposure. All individuals died at 40 degrees C. Crabs osmoregulated, suggesting that the factors evaluated did not affect salt absorption or secretion. Individuals were weak hyperosmorregulators at lower salinities in the pH 7 control, but they became strong hyperosmoregulators at acidified pH 6.3. Alterations in oxygen consumption and hepatosomatic index were observed in individuals exposed to the acidified pH combined with temperatures or salinities, compared to those kept in the control pH. Q10 was elevated under an acidified pH, with crabs using proteins and lipids as energy substrates. The interaction between reduced pH and temperature or salinity thus affected physiological mechanisms related to the energetic metabolism, but elevated temperatures are more limiting because they affected survival. These physiological effects of acute exposure offer clues about extreme climatic events, which have a short duration but can affect the related energy demands."
1,"Both submerged aquatic vegetation and salt marsh are important coastal ecosystems known for their effectiveness in sediment trapping and carbon burial. However, their proximity can lead to competition for limited sediment resources, potentially compromising their capacity to facilitate sufficient sediment deposition to withstand sea-level rise. Here we applied the Delft3D flow and sediment transport model in a shallow coastal bay to assess how seasonal variations in seagrass density and storms modulate sediment retention and connectivity between subtidal flats and intertidal marsh. Results show that submerged seagrass meadows acted as temporary storage for fine sediment and altered the timing of sediment transport to an adjacent marsh through seasonal growth cycles. When seagrass occupied subtidal flats, sediment flux to the marsh was controlled by seasonal seagrass density variations, with peak fluxes during winter senescence. In contrast, wave-induced sediment resuspension on the flats was the major contributor for marsh sediment input in the simulation with no seagrass, with peak storm-driven fluxes in summer/autumn. Overall, seagrass meadows significantly increased annual sediment accumulation on the vegetated subtidal flats by tenfold, while reducing annual marsh sediment flux and edge erosion by 20%. Seagrass meadows and marsh were both able to maintain a sediment deposition rate comparable to the rapid sea-level rise at the study site despite the absence of terrestrial sediment sources. Our findings highlight the strong seasonal control subtidal aquatic vegetation has in the vertical and horizontal dynamics of tidal flat-marsh systems and provide insights that can inform wetland restoration and management strategies in similar systems. Submerged aquatic vegetation and salt marsh are valuable coastal ecosystems known for their effectiveness in sediment trapping. However, their proximity can lead to competition for limited sediment resources, compromising their capacity to vertically accrete and withstand sea-level rise. Here we used a well-tested coastal model in a shallow bay hosting the world's largest seagrass restoration site to examine the seasonal sediment dynamics between a submerged seagrass meadow and an adjacent intertidal marsh. We find that seagrass changed the timing of sediment transport to the marsh through seasonal growth cycles and acted as a sediment source for the marsh during low-density periods in winter. On an annual scale, the seagrass meadow significantly increased sediment accumulation on the vegetated subtidal flats by tenfold, while concurrently reducing marsh sediment supply and edge erosion by 20%. Both ecosystems coped well with rapid sea-level rise at the site, even in the absence of terrestrial sediment sources. Sediment retention in seagrass meadows increased annual deposition on vegetated subtidal flats tenfold compared to bare-flat conditions Seagrass meadows were a sediment source for the marsh during winter senescence while limiting transport to the marsh during growing seasons Seagrass and marsh accumulated sediment at rates comparable to sea-level rise at the site despite the lack of terrestrial sediment sources"
0,"This paper asks whether extreme weather events are becoming more discernible. It uses the Vanderbilt University Television News Archives to determine if annual coverage given to heat waves, droughts, hurricanes and floods has increased on the network news between 1968 and 1996. An index of extreme weather events shows a clear trend toward increased coverage, especially since 1988. However, the different types of extreme events do not receive equal coverage: for example, annual peaks for droughts contain about twice as many stories as the peaks for heat waves. The data further reveal that there is no association between coverage of climate change and the overall coverage of extreme events. While extreme events have attracted more stories in the U.S., there has been no increase in the coverage devoted to extreme events in foreign countries. The possible effects of shifts in TV coverage on the public salience and understanding of climate change are discussed."
1,"BACKGROUND: The Arab region has witnessed different biological hazards, including cholera, yellow fever, and the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, changes in rainfall and increased vegetation cover led to locust outbreaks in Tunisia, Libya, Morocco, and Saudi Arabia. This problem still exists and affects more than 20 countries and concerns indicate food shortages and food insecurity for more than 20 million people. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to detect mental health problems related to climate change in the Arab world. METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive survey was applied to determine the prevalence of mental health problems related to climate change (MHPCC). A random sample consisted of 1080 participants (523 male and 557 female), residents in 18 Arab countries; their ages ranged from 25 to 60 years. The Mental Health Problems related to Climate Change Questionnaire (MHPCCQ) was completed online. RESULTS: The results indicated average levels of MHPCC prevalence. The results also revealed no significant statistical differences in the MHPCC due to gender, educational class, and marital status except in climate anxiety; there were statistical differences in favor of married subgroup individuals. At the same time, there are statistically significant differences in the MHPCC due to the residing country variable in favor of Syria, Yemen, Algeria, Libya, and Oman regarding fears, anxiety, alienation, and somatic symptoms. In addition, Tunisia, Bahrain, Sudan, and Iraq were higher in climate depression than the other countries. CONCLUSION: The findings shed light on the prevalence of MHPCC in the Arab world and oblige mental health system workers, including policymakers, mental health providers, and departments of psychology in Arab universities, to take urgent action to assess and develop the system for mental health to manage the risks of extreme climate change on the human mental health."
1,"The danger of global warming we face today is caused by the increasing amount of the gases which cause greenhouse effect in the atmosphere. Particularly, industrial revolution increases the human-sourced greenhouse gas levels. In this sense, all sectors like agriculture, food production, industry, tourism, health are affected by this important phenomenon on the agenda. Although global climate change is directly caused by greenhouse gas in agriculture sector, paradoxically it is the most affected sector by this change, that is because agriculture depends on climate conditions and it causes economic, environmental and social fluctuation. Melting of glaciers, rising of the water level in the oceans, vapourisation in the fresh water resource as the heat goes up, they all harm natural balance and threaten numerous plant and animal kinds. These changes have led countries to take precautions in this matter. Being effective since the 1970's, international efforts have been put forward in order to limit the greenhouse gas release to the atmosphere and to promote usage of clean-energy types. Agriculture is quite rich by means of renewable energy resources, which are expected as a solution to global warming. However, we have to form the infrastructure in order to run these resources effectively. In this study, the effects of agriculture on global climate change, the effects of global climate change on agriculture, and the effect of agriculture on the reduction of global climate change were considered. Furthermore, global climate change defines the importance of agricultural extension as a solution to the encountered problems in agriculture."
1,"High Asian glaciers and precipitation have directly or indirectly influenced the freshwater supply of billions of people and natural ecosystems in surrounding areas. To better understand the hydroclimatic changes in the High Asian transboundary river basins in the context of global warming, more precipitation-sensitive proxy data are needed. In this paper, we used the tree-ring cores of Pinus densata and Picea brachytyla from the southern Tibetan Plateau (TP) to establish a tree-ring-width composite chronology and estimate hydrological annual (September-August) precipitation (r(2) = 47.0%, p < 0.01) for the Lohit River basin from 1720 to 2019. Our reconstructed precipitation was closely linked with the glacier mass balance of Shishapangma peak, which may provide us with some evidence for glacier fluctuations in the southern TP. Our precipitation reconstruction successfully captured recent dry trends and generally agreed with other tree-ring-based precipitation reconstructions from nearby regions. In addition, reconstructed precipitation variations were inconsistent with recorded monsoon-season Brahmaputra discharge."
1,"Hypoxic blackwater events occur worldwide, affecting inland and coastal waters. These events have been exacerbated by man-made floodplain drainage, leading to large-scale fish kills and ecological degradation. This paper presents a new method to identify estuarine catchment areas that are most likely to generate hypoxic conditions. The method uses established risk factors, including vegetation type, inundation extent and duration, ground-truthed in eastern Australia. A catchment is at higher risk of hypoxic blackwater generation if (a) it is located where floodwaters are high and/or drainage is impeded, (b) the site topography includes an extensive, low-lying floodplain; and/or (c) the land-use and environmental characteristics have a high deoxygenation potential. Consequent impacts to an estuary are determined by the floodplain connectivity with the estuary, and the discharge characteristics of the catchment drainage system. Where multiple, proximate catchments have similar drainage conditions, compounding plumes of hypoxic blackwater can overwhelm the assimilation capacity of the estuary. Climate change may significantly increase the volume and frequency of blackwater events in estuarine environments as a result of reduced drainage due to sea level rise, higher temperatures, and more intense and sporadic rainfall events. It is recommended that management measures be introduced to mitigate the effects of climate change and avoid further widespread hypoxic blackwater events."
1,"Fisheries and aquaculture make a crucial contribution to global food security, nutrition and livelihoods. However, the UN Sustainable Development Goals separate marine and terrestrial food production sectors and ecosystems. To sustainably meet increasing global demands for fish, the interlinkages among goals within and across fisheries, aquaculture and agriculture sectors must be recognized and addressed along with their changing nature. Here, we assess and highlight development challenges for fisheries-dependent countries based on analyses of interactions and trade-offs between goals focusing on food, biodiversity and climate change. We demonstrate that some countries are likely to face double jeopardies in both fisheries and agriculture sectors under climate change. The strategies to mitigate these risks will be context-dependent, and will need to directly address the trade-offs among Sustainable Development Goals, such as halting biodiversity loss and reducing poverty. Countries with low adaptive capacity but increasing demand for food require greater support and capacity building to transition towards reconciling trade-offs. Necessary actions are context-dependent and include effective governance, improved management and conservation, maximizing societal and environmental benefits from trade, increased equitability of distribution and innovation in food production, including continued development of low input and low impact aquaculture."
1,"The paper selected Shijin Irrigation District as the study area. Considering the future climate change, the paper studied the effects of climate change on summer maize growth. The effects of climate change on summer maize yield were quantitatively analyzed by combining the climate scenario Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP)4.5 and AquaCrop model. The results showed that under the RCP4.5 scenario, the future yield of summer maize in Shijin Irrigation District was mainly reduced, but the yield change showed an upward trend. When the direct impact of CO2 is not considered, the yield change ranged from - 6.72- 3.04%, and the deforestation rate of summer maize is 10.795 kg for every 1 degrees C increase in growth period. The increase of summer maize is 3.35 kg for every 1 mm increase in rainfall. When considering the direct impact of CO2, the yield change ranged from - 4.04+ 0.11%. It can be seen that CO2 can compensate for the production reduction effect caused by rising temperature."
1,"Future climate change will have severe impacts on the geographic distribution of species, likely leading to shifts in their suitable habitat and eventually to the extinction of some species whose distribution areas are restricted. However, some species may respond differently to climate change. In this study we model the current and future potential habitats of three Juniperus species with different population trends: J. jaliscana, J. monticola and J. pinchotii. Occurrence records were collected across their distribution, combined with environmental and topographical variables to generate a MaxEnt model of the potential distributions in the years 2050 and 2070. The most important environmental variables were precipitation of wettest quarter for J. jaliscana, maximum temperature of warmest month for J. monticola, and mean temperature of coldest quarter for J. pinchotii. Our results showed that the habitat suitability of these three Juniperus species decreased overall by more than 50% under the climate change scenarios. These findings contributed to a better understanding of the impacts of climate change on ecological distribution of these species and could inform decisions regarding to their conservation, and management, and sustainable use strategies, as well as to implement active ex situ conservation strategies."
1,"The global ocean and atmosphere are warming. There is increasing evidence suggesting that, in addition to other environmental factors, climate change is affecting species distributions and local population dynamics. Additionally, as a consequence of the growing levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), the oceans are taking up increasing amounts of this CO2, causing ocean pH to decrease (ocean acidification). The relative impacts of ocean acidification on population dynamics have yet to be investigated, despite many studies indicating that there will be at least a sublethal impact on many marine organisms, particularly key calcifying organisms. Using empirical data, we forced a barnacle (Semibalanus balanoides) population model to investigate the relative influence of sea surface temperature (SST) and ocean acidification on a population nearing the southern limit of its geographic distribution. Hindcast models were compared to observational data from Cellar Beach (southwestern United Kingdom). Results indicate that a declining pH trend (-0.0017 unit/yr), indicative of ocean acidification over the past 50 years, does not cause an observable impact on the population abundance relative to changes caused by fluctuations in temperature. Below the critical temperature (here T-crit = 13.1 degrees C), pH has a more significant affect on population dynamics at this southern range edge. However, above this value, SST has the overriding influence. At lower SST, a decrease in pH (according to the National Bureau of Standards, pH(NBS)) from 8.2 to 7.8 can significantly decrease the population abundance. The lethal impacts of ocean acidification observed in experiments on early life stages reduce cumulative survival by similar to 25%, which again will significantly alter the population level at this southern limit. Furthermore, forecast predictions from this model suggest that combined acidification and warming cause this local population to die out 10 years earlier than would occur if there was only global warming and no concomitant decrease in pH."
1,"Ecological niche models, or species distribution models, have been widely used to identify potentially suitable areas for species in future climate change scenarios. However, there are inherent errors to these models due to their inability to evaluate species occurrence influenced by non-climatic factors. With the intuit to improve the modelling predictions for a bromeliad-breeding treefrog (Phyllodytes melanomystax, Hylidae), we investigate how the climatic suitability of bromeliads influences the distribution model for the treefrog in the context of baseline and 2050 climate change scenarios. We used point occurrence data on the frog and the bromeliad (Vriesea procera, Bromeliaceae) to generate their predicted distributions based on baseline and 2050 climates. Using a consensus of five algorithms, we compared the accuracy of the models and the geographic predictions for the frog generated from two modelling procedures: (i) a climate-only model for P.melanomystax and V.procera; and (ii) a climate-biotic model for P.melanomystax, in which the climatic suitability of the bromeliad was jointly considered with the climatic variables. Both modelling approaches generated strong and similar predictive power for P.melanomystax, yet climate-biotic modelling generated more concise predictions, particularly for the year 2050. Specifically, because the predicted area of the bromeliad overlaps with the predictions for the treefrog in the baseline climate, both modelling approaches produce reasonable similar predicted areas for the anuran. Alternatively, due to the predicted loss of northern climatically suitable areas for the bromeliad by 2050, only the climate-biotic models provide evidence that northern populations of P.melanomystax will likely be negatively affected by 2050."
1,"Morocco is facing challenges with its water resources due to population growth, industrial expansion, agriculture, urban development, tourism, climate change, overuse of underground water sources, and pollution from inadequate sanitation and chemical fertilizers. The Gharb aquifer is significant for supplying drinking water and irrigation in the country. Souk El Arbaa is a Moroccan city located in the northwestern part of the Kingdom of Morocco in the Kenitra Province. Its economic activities depend mainly on agriculture and livestock raising. This study aims to assess the groundwater status of a basin in a semi-arid climate in the Souk El Arbaa for drinking purposes by collecting 14 samples in 2022 from different locations and analyzing their physicochemical characteristics. The quality assessment was made by estimating electrical conductivity, pH, total dissolved solids, total hardness, calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, bicarbonates, chloride, sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium. The results showed that most of the groundwater in the study area is very hard, and all groundwater in the study area, according to the Moroccan Standards for drinking purposes, exceeds the permissible limits for nitrate and ammonium."
1,"Increasing human activity leads to increased concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, especially carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) that impact climate change and global warming. This condition encourages the occurrence of weather anomaly phenomena in the atmosphere such as rainfall fluctuations, dryness, an increase in air temperature and sea-level rise. Sea-level rise was a potency of seawater inundation that gave an impact on land degradation. The study aimed to determine sea-level rise used three variables of disaster with two cumulative scenarios. The toward step used the simulation using a raster calculator in ArcGIS 10.2 to analyze the impact of sea-level rise to inundation disaster. The results showed that the sea-level rise on the South Coast of Yogyakarta based on (1) Scenario 1A (existing) was 1.4457 m (the prediction year 2030) and 2.0827 m (the prediction year 2050). According to the scenario (2) 1B (extreme) is 1.6297 m (the prediction year 2030) and 2.2667 m (the prediction year 2050). The increase in the sea- level rise on the south coast of Yogyakarta provides a disaster effect of inundation in the area directly dealing the beach and near the river mouth for example in Bantul Regency and Kulon Progo Regency."
1,"Leading scientific experts in the field of climate change suggest that a multifaceted response to global warming should include the use of forest carbon offsets (also known as forest sinks). Emerging emissions reduction legislation in the United States (US) accounts for this recommendation by allowing for carbon offsets derived from domestic forestry projects (e.g. reforestation, afforestation, avoided deforestation). Given that the majority of US forestland is privately owned and non-industrial, the current research employs a behavioral model to measure intentions of private non-industrial forestland owners to participate in carbon sequestration and trading. Results suggest that very few (5.1 %) of these forestland owners are currently involved in carbon sequestration and trading, but half (50.4 %) were at least somewhat interested in exploring opportunities to do so. The Theory of Planned Behavior, acting as the theoretical frame of reference, was extended in the current research to include environmental orientation, innovativeness, perceived risk and tested knowledge, all of which had significant effects on core model constructs: attitude, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control and behavioral intentions. The extended model explained a significant amount of the variance related to behavioral intentions to sequester carbon on private US forestland (R-2 = .53)."
1,"Land surface albedo is an important parameter affecting the climate locally and globally. A synthesis of current studies urgently calls for a better understanding of the impact of climate change on the surface albedo. The Middle East is expected to experience major climatic changes during the coming decades and has already undergone major losses in its vegetation cover. This study explores how climate change related disturbances, such as severe drought and fire events, influence albedo trends in the largest remaining forest area of the Middle East, the Zagros Mountains. We analyzed time series of albedo, Leaf Area Index (LAI), burn severity (dNBR), and the number of fire events all obtained from MODIS satellite images between 2000 and 2016, together with climatic data from 1950 to 2016. The Zagros area is continuously suffering from low precipitation, high temperatures, and evermore-frequent wildfire events. Our large-scale analysis revealed that albedo is linked to precipitation, number of fire events, dNBR, and LAI with the average correlation coefficients of -0.26, -0.50, 0.17, and -0.72, respectively. Using four study sites located in different parts of the Zagros area, we showed disturbances influence albedo differently. Drought condition resulted in a marginal increasing trend in albedo, whereas fire events resulted in a decreasing trend. This article is the first report linking climate change with albedo in Iran.

1,"Climate change and other anthropogenic disturbances have created an era characterized by the inability of most ecosystems to maintain their original, pristine states, the Anthropocene. Investigating new and innovative strategies that may facilitate ecosystem restoration is thus becoming increasingly important, particularly for coral reefs around the globe which are deteriorating at an alarming rate. The Great Barrier Reef (GBR) lost half its coral cover between 1985 and 2012, and experienced back-to-back heat-induced mass bleaching events and high coral mortality in 2016 and 2017. Here we investigate the efficacy of interspecific hybridization as a tool to develop coral stock with enhanced climate resilience. We crossed two Acropora species pairs from the GBR and examined several phenotypic traits over 28 weeks of exposure to ambient and elevated temperature and pCO(2). While elevated temperature and pCO(2) conditions negatively affected size and survival of both purebreds and hybrids, higher survival and larger recruit size were observed in some of the hybrid offspring groups under both ambient and elevated conditions. Further, interspecific hybrids had high fertilization rates, normal embryonic development, and similar Symbiodinium uptake and photochemical efficiency as purebred offspring. While the fitness of these hybrids in the field and their reproductive and backcrossing potential remain to be investigated, current findings provide proof-of-concept that interspecific hybridization may produce genotypes with enhanced climate resilience, and has the potential to increase the success of coral reef restoration initiatives."
1,"Areas affected by forest fires that occurred in 2005 were mapped in the municipalities of Boca do Acre and Labrea (in the southern part of Brazil's state of Amazonas) and estimates were made of the loss of biomass and carbon stock and the committed emissions from increased tree mortality due to fire. Fire scars observed on Landsat-5 TM satellite images from 2004 to 2006 were visually interpreted and digitized; over 865.6 km(2) of forest affected by fire were mapped, the majority (2.9% of the total forest cover) concentrated along the southern edges of the municipalities, which border on the states of Rondonia and Acre. The greatest loss of biomass due to the increase in tree mortality was indicated by the survey made 4 years after the fires: 4.5 x 10(6) Mg total (above + below-ground) and 3.7 x 10(6) Mg (only above-ground). Consequently, 2.2 x 10(6) Mg C (total) and 1.8 x 10(6) Mg C (above-ground) of potential carbon emissions were committed from the initial burn of forest biomass and from trees killed by the fire. Emissions occur both through oxidation of dead biomass by decomposition or through combustion in subsequent fire events. Our results indicate that fires can affect extensive tracts of forest and can emit significant amounts of carbon to the atmosphere in periods of drought. Fire plays a significant role as a threat to the biological balance of the forest and causes loss of biomass and emission of greenhouse gases that have critical implications for the future of forests in the Amazon.

1,"When organisms are unable to feed ad libitum they may be more susceptible to negative effects of environmental stressors such as ocean acidification and warming (OAW). We reared sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) at 15 or 20 degrees C and at ambient or high PCO2 (650 versus 1750 mu atm PCO2; pH = 8.1 or 7.6) at ad libitum feeding and observed no discernible effect of PCO2 on the size-at-age of juveniles after 277 (20 degrees C) and 367 (15 degrees C) days. Feeding trials were then conducted including a restricted ration (25% ad libitum). At 15 degrees C, growth rate increased with ration but was unaffected by PCO2. At 20 degrees C, acidification and warming acted antagonistically and low feeding level enhanced PCO2 effects. Differences in growth were not merely a consequence of lower food intake but also linked to changes in digestive efficiency. The specific activity of digestive enzymes (amylase, trypsin, phosphatase alkaline and aminopeptidase N) at 20 degrees C was lower at the higher PCO2 level. Our study highlights the importance of incorporating restricted feeding into experimental designs examining OAW and suggests that ad libitum feeding used in the majority of the studies to date may not have been suitable to detect impacts of ecological significance."
1,"The potential of mitigation actions to limit global warming within 2 degrees C (ref.(1)) might rely on the abundant supply of biomass for large-scale bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) that is assumed to scale up markedly in the future(2-5). However, the detrimental effects of climate change on crop yields may reduce the capacity of BECCS and threaten food security(6-8), thus creating an unrecognized positive feedback loop on global warming. We quantified the strength of this feedback by implementing the responses of crop yields to increases in growing season temperature, atmospheric CO2 concentration and intensity of nitrogen (N) fertilization in a compact Earth system model(9). Exceeding a threshold of climate change would cause transformative changes in social-ecological systems by jeopardizing climate stability and threatening food security. If global mitigation alongside large-scale BECCS is delayed to 2060 when global warming exceeds about 2.5 degrees C, then the yields of agricultural residues for BECCS would be too low to meet the Paris goal of 2 degrees C by 2200. This risk of failure is amplified by the sustained demand for food, leading to an expansion of cropland or intensification of N fertilization to compensate for climate-induced yield losses. Our findings there by reinforce the urgency of early mitigation, preferably by 2040, to avoid irreversible climate change and serious food crises unless other negative-emission technologies become available in the near future to compensate for the reduced capacity of BECCS."
1,"To identify current and future human health risks from urban air pollution, size-segregated particle samples were collected under various seasonal and meteorological conditions in Dresden, Germany. Sampling days were grouped into twelve categories depending on season, air mass origin and temperature. A comprehensive chemical characterisation and mass closure were performed. The particulate matter (PM) mass concentration and composition were shown to be highly dependent on these categories. The highest PM mass concentrations were found on cold winter days, mainly due to compounds of anthropogenic origin. The current annual mean PM mass concentration and composition were calculated using the occurrence frequencies of the categories (weighted mean). Information about future changes of the occurrence frequencies of the categories was deduced from climate models. Assuming that PM concentration and composition within a given category do not change, the annual mean PM mass concentration and composition were calculated for two scenarios (weighted mean, 2071-2100). As a result, it was found that the annual mean PM mass concentration is likely to decrease slightly by 2100, mainly due to a decrease of sulphate and soot mass concentrations. Generally, chemicals originating from anthropogenic emissions (PAHs, trace metals) are estimated to decrease. However, it is concluded that emission reduction measures are still necessary to control urban air quality including PM even if climate change will lead to a certain reduction in PM.

1,"Lowland stream ecosystems are under threat from climate change, industrialization, urbanization, and intensive agriculture. Since the 1980s, improvements in water quality have led to an increase in lowland stream biodiversity. Despite restoration efforts, however, further recovery is often hampered by the presence of regionspecific (combinations of) stressors, and species-specific stressor responses. Identification of these stressors may not be achieved by the analysis of abundance data over large areas for entire communities or species assemblages. Therefore, our study introduces an alternative in-depth approach, selecting Ephemeroptera as a model organism group and analyzing 41 years of species abundance data across distinct geographical regions. Our findings revealed that 15 Ephemeroptera species had already disappeared before 1985, emphasizing the importance of evaluating an extended historical period when analyzing biodiversity trends. While biodiversity was generally characterized by an initial recovery that stagnated over time, the analysis of the past 41 years of Ephemeroptera abundance data revealed strong differences in species' abundance trends between periods, regions, and species. Certain species were likely to have benefitted from local restoration measures in specific geographical regions, while others may have declined due to the presence of region-specific stressors. Our approach underscores the importance of studying the development of region- and species-specific stream biodiversity trends over time to aid the selection of the appropriate restoration measures to recover lowland stream biodiversity."
1,"The World Bank has recently developed a method to evaluate the effects of climate change on six hydrological indicators across 8951 basins of the world. The indicators are designed for decision-makers and stakeholders to consider climate risk when planning water resources and related infrastructure investments. Analysis of these hydrological indicators shows that, on average, mean annual runoff will decline in southern Europe; most of Africa; and in southern North America and most of Central and South America. Mean reference crop water deficit, on the other hand, combines temperature and precipitation and is anticipated to increase in nearly all locations globally due to rising global temperatures, with the most dramatic increases projected to occur in southern Europe, southeastern Asia, and parts of South America. These results suggest overall guidance on which regions to focus water infrastructure solutions that could address future runoff flow uncertainty. Most important, we find that uncertainty in projections of mean annual runoff and high runoff events is higher in poorer countries, and increases over time. Uncertainty increases over time for all income categories, but basins in the lower and lower-middle income categories are forecast to experience dramatically higher increases in uncertainty relative to those in the upper-middle and upper income categories. The enhanced understanding of the uncertainty of climate projections for the water sector that this work provides strongly support the adoption of rigorous approaches to infrastructure design under uncertainty, as well as design that incorporates a high degree of flexibility, in response to both risk of damage and opportunity to exploit water supply 'windfalls' that might result, but would require smart infrastructure investments to manage to the greatest benefit."
1,"We used Tasmania as a case example to question the consensus that few marine species have recently become extinct or are approaching extinction. Threats to marine and estuarine species primarily in the form of climate change, invasive species, fishing, and catchment discharges-are accelerating, fully encompass species ranges, and are of sufficient magnitude to cause extinction. Our ignorance of declining biodiversity in the marine environment largely results from an almost complete lack of systematic broad-scale sampling and an overreliance on physicochemical data to monitor environmental trends. Population declines for marine species approaching extinction will generally go unnoticed because of the hidden nature of their environment and lack of quantitative data."
1,"The impact of climate change on clinical care is evident through its interference with access to health care and the adverse health effects of extreme heat, floods, wildfire smoke, pollen, consequent eco-anxiety, and other climate-related exposures. Health care providers can address the health crisis caused by climate change by advocating for more sustainable health care delivery systems as well as directly helping patients anticipate potential health impacts and reduce their exposure to these hazards. We also need to expand efforts to train the workforce needed to provide quality and effec-tive health care in the face of unique challenges in this context."
1,"Phosphite represents a reduced form of phosphate that belongs to a class of crop growth-promoting chemicals termed biostimulants. Previous research has shown that phosphite application can enhance root growth, but its underlying mechanism, especially during environmental stresses, remains elusive. To uncover this, we undertook a series of morphological and physiological analyses under nutrient, water and heat stresses following a foliar application in wheat. Non-invasive 3D imaging of root system architecture directly in soil using X-ray Computed Tomography revealed that phosphite treatment improves root architectural traits and increased root biomass. Biochemical and physiological assays identified that phosphite treatment significantly increases Nitrate Reductase (NR) activity, leaf photosynthesis and stomatal conductance, suggesting improved Nitrogen and Carbon assimilation, respectively. These differences were more pronounced under heat or drought treatment (photosynthesis and photosystem II stability) and nutrient deficiency (root traits and NR). Overall our results suggest that phosphite treatment improves the ability of plants to tolerate abiotic stresses through improved Nitrogen and Carbon assimilation, combined with improved root growth which may improve biomass and yield."
1,"The process of assessing vulnerability in agriculture, water resources, marine and terrestrial ecosystems and coastal zone management due to climate change requires construction of predicted vision of climate scenarios under physically reasonable assumptions of greenhouse gas levels. In and and hot climatic conditions, even minor climatic changes will have significant impact on survival of plant species, wild animals, and other desert ecosystems as well as on human health. The paper presents future changes in temperature, precipitation and humidity in Yemen, Oman, UAE and Qatar under different scenarios using IPCC database derived through GCM's. Various climatic change scenarios developed by IPCC were reviewed, A2 and B2 climatic scenarios were selected for the study. Long-term simulated records derived by the following models were retrieved from the database: 1. Hadley Model -(HADCM3) 2. Canadian Climatic Model - (CGCM2) 3. National Center for Atmospheric Research Model - (NCAR-PCM) Using 1970-2000 values as baseline, variations in 2020-2050 and 2070-2099 were estimated and statistically analyzed to determine uncertainties in prediction. Summarized impacts of climate change on human health based on empirical approach for the region is presented in the paper to make it better prepared (adapted) to the climatic changes with recommendations on future capacity building in modeling and data collection."
0,"Habitat destruction is the leading cause of species extinctions. However, there is typically a time-lag between the reduction in habitat area and the eventual disappearance of the remnant populations. These surviving but ultimately doomed species represent an extinction debt. Calculating the magnitude of such future extinction events has been hampered by potentially inaccurate assumptions about the slope of species-area relationships, which are habitat- and taxon-specific. We overcome this challenge by applying a method that uses the historical sequence of deforestation in the Azorean Islands, to calculate realistic and ecologically-adjusted species-area relationships. The results reveal dramatic and hitherto unrecognized levels of extinction debt, as a result of the extensive destruction of the native forest:> 95%, in < 600 yr. Our estimations suggest that more than half of the extant forest arthropod species, which have evolved in and are dependent on the native forest, might eventually be driven to extinction. Data on species abundances from Graciosa Island, where only a very small patch of secondary native vegetation still exists, as well as the number of species that have not been found in the last 45 yr, despite the extensive sampling effort, offer support to the predictions made. We argue that immediate action to restore and expand native forest habitat is required to avert the loss of numerous endemic species in the near future."
1,"The focus of this paper is the relationship between soil health and global food security. We discuss the role of climate change on food security and the role of farmer profitability in promoting soil health. Specific objectives were to (a) consider the role that U.S. agricultural production plays in global food security, (b) consider key mechanisms by which soil health impacts U.S. agricultural production, and (c) offer a comprehensive strategy to scale adoption of soil health systems. Based on the Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) Food Price Index, U.S. commodity exports influence global food prices, linking U.S. crop production to food security. Soil health affects food security through crop yield, crop yield resilience, and farmer profitability. Results relating soil health and crop yield are complicated by biophysical complexity, lack of standardized research practices, and the scale of research trials. Studies of the relationship between yield resilience and soil health are similarly inconclusive. Despite mixed research results, interviews with 100 U.S. farmers found over half reported increased crop yield due to soil health management systems, and most reported more resilient yields. Partial budget analysis of production information from 100 interviews found using soil health management systems increased net farm income (in 2020 U.S. dollars) by US$127.61 ha(-1) ($51.66 acre(-1)) for maize (Zea mays L.) and $110.84 ha(-1) ($44.87 acre(-1)) for soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.]. We detail a path to increase adoption of soil health systems so healthy soils can serve as the foundation for producing food, mitigating climate change, and increasing farmer profitability."
1,"Northwestern China has experienced dramatic climate change characterized by rapid warming since the 1980s with the warming trend substantially slowing after 2000. Qinghai spruce (Picea crassifolia Kom.), a key tree species in northwest China, has been predicted to be strongly coupled with climate change. However, how the trends in biomass growth change at different canopy positions under climate change and whether climate-growth responses vary with canopy position remain unclear. A total of 222 trees were sampled by a stand-total sampling strategy in the central Qilian Mountains. Trees were assigned to four canopy positions according to height and distance from neighbors: dominant, codominant, intermediate, and suppressed. Our results indicate that trees in dominant and codominant canopy positions dominate the decreasing trend in stand-level biomass from 1980 to 2000 and the increasing trend from 2000-2013, contributing 81.3 % and 86 %, respectively, whereas trees in the intermediate and suppressed canopy positions contributed less. This result was attributed to a more sensitive response of biomass growth in trees in dominant and codominant canopy positions to climate change. From 1980 to 2000, the stronger decreasing trend in biomass growth at dominant and codominant canopy positions is mostly accounted for by increasing temperature. A more pronounced water deficit might have restricted biomass growth more than that at the intermediate and suppressed canopy positions. However, from 2000 to 2013, drought stress was relieved and summer standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index became a leading factor, which promoted the recovery in biomass at dominant and codominant canopy positions. In a word, compared with intermediate and suppressed canopy trees, those in dominant and codominant positions are less resistant to drought, but dominant and codominant canopy position's biomass can recover more when drought stress is relieved. A more robust understanding of canopy-level growth response and resilience to climate change is crucial to fully understand forest growth dynamics under fluctuating climate conditions."
1,"While most of the world is thought to be on long-term economic growth paths, more than one-sixth of the world is roughly as poor today as their ancestors were hundreds of years ago. The majority of the extremely poor live in the tropics. The latitudinal gradient in income is highly suggestive of underlying biophysical drivers, of which disease conditions are an especially salient example. However, conclusions have been confounded by the simultaneous causality between income and disease, in addition to potentially spurious relationships. We use a simultaneous equations model to estimate the relative effects of vector-borne and parasitic diseases (VBPDs) and income on each other, controlling for other factors. Our statistical model indicates that VBPDs have systematically affected economic development, evident in contemporary levels of per capita income. The burden of VBDPs is, in turn, determined by underlying ecological conditions. In particular, the model predicts it to rise as biodiversity falls. Through these positive effects on human health, the model thus identifies measurable economic benefits of biodiversity."
1,"Urbanization-induced phenological shifts may provide evidence on how vegetation will respond to global warming. However, the effects of urbanization on vegetation phenology are poorly understood in urban environments. Using MODIS data between 2007 and 2013, we investigated the trends of the phenological metrics (i.e., start, end, and length of growing season: SOS, EOS and GSL) of individual cities and across cities relative to rural areas for China's 32 major cities. We found that the effects of urbanization on phenology decayed exponentially toward rural areas, and were closely related to the land surface temperature (LST) for more than half of the cities. The phenological sensitivity to temperature were 9-11 days SOS advance and 6-10 days EOS delay per 1 degrees C increase of LST. On average across all cities, the growing season started 11.9 days earlier and ended 5.4 days later in urban zones compared to rural counterparts. The urbanization effects increased with increasing latitudes, following the pattern of urban heat island effects in general. Our study suggests the value of urban environments in studying the phenological responses to future global change. However, the urbanization impacts are complex and need more direct observations, experimental manipulations, and cross boundary inter-comparison studies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
1,"This paper adds to a limited literature eliciting willingness to pay (WTP) for mitigation measures against natural hazards caused by climate change, on coastal and marine environments. Our case study is Santander, a coastal region in Northern Spain. The case-study specific natural hazards concern (a) sea-level rise, high tides and extreme wave events that lead to floods and beach erosion, (b) rise in sea temperature that leads to invasive jellyfish blooms and changes in native biodiversity. In particular, we employ a choice experiment (CE) to elicit the value locals place on improvements, through the implementation of appropriate mitigation measures, in biodiversity, recreational opportunities and on decreases in health risks associated with jellyfish blooms. Results suggest that people value positively benefits in terms of increased biodiversity and recreation opportunities, as well as health risk reductions, and point to interesting policy implications.

1,"Venezuela will soon become the first Andean country to lose all of its glaciers, as the eternal snows of the Sierra Nevada de Merida (SNM) disappear. Although documentation of glacier retreat in Venezuela commenced over a century ago, an updated reconstruction at sufficient spatial resolution is warranted. Our objectives were to (a) produce detailed multitemporal maps of glacier cover in the SNM since 1952 and revise historical estimates for 1910 and (b) document changes in cover and rates of glacier retreat of the last Venezuelan glacier at Humboldt Peak. We integrated multiple information sources, including topographic/geomorphic evidence, high-resolution aerial photographs, satellite images, historical maps, panoramic photos, and field observations. We present 1:5,000 maps of glacier cover between 1952 and 2019 and revise the maps of 1910. In Venezuela, glacial area has decreased 98 percent between 1952 and 2019 (from 2.317 km(2) to 0.046 km(2)). Glacier retreat rates increased after 1998, with a maximum of -16.9 percent year(-1) between 2016 and 2019. These new maps should provide an essential tool for biophysical, ecological, and historical studies and a key reference for promoting awareness on climate change in the tropical Andes, where glaciers are intimately linked with cultural identity."
0,"Midlatitude cyclones taken from 18 months of global operational Met Office Unified Model analysis archives were combined to form three-dimensional composite cyclones. Given an accurate dynamical and thermodynamical representation of the atmosphere from 4D-Var analysis, this study attributes differences between observations and the model cloud/precipitation to potential shortcomings in the physical parametrizations that control cloud/precipitation. Coincident (+/- 6 h) data from CloudSat radar, AMSR-E microwave, and ISCCP flux products were collected into composites for comparison. Only cyclones over the ocean were analysed here. Considering all of the observations in a single composite shows that horizontal slices through the composite display qualitative agreement between the mean reflectivity structures seen in the UM and CloudSat data. Splitting the composite cyclone into quadrants reveals that the UM underpredicts fractions of reflectivities greater than -20 dBZ and +10 dBZ at heights above 2 km in the poleward quadrants. This lack of cloud is manifested in smaller short-wave top-of-atmosphere fluxes from the UM composite cyclone than from the observations. Comparison of UM precipitation rates with CloudSat shows agreement to within the assumed potential bias of the observations. Copyright (C) 2011 British Crown copyright, the Met Office.

1,"Climate change will affect agricultural production conditions, which will have effects on yields and production costs for Quebec farmers. This would likely affect the relative competitive position of Quebec in North America. The Delphi technique and partial budgets were used to develop climate change scenarios for the 2050 period and to assess the impact of these scenarios on the relative competitiveness of Quebec and its competitors in North America. Results indicate that Quebec's competitive position would improve, with more favourable conditions for its corn and apple production and with less favourable conditions for its competitors' maple syrup production."
1,"The aridity-related drought studies have been carried out extensively in Brazilian semi-arid ecosystems, although there is no report on relating aridity with different drought indices over the recent decades. Due to drought impact on agriculture and natural ecosystems, it has attracted extensive attention in the academic community. In this study, the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinityderived Soil Water Deficit Index (SWDI), the Meteosat Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI) radiance-derived solar and infrared estimates, and the SEVIRI-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) datasets were employed to investigate the spatial and temporal characteristics of the drought episodes and the vegetation dynamic responses. An approach was implemented for identifying drought using a combination of mathematical and statistical features derived from the SPEI. The results showed that: (1) The frequency, duration, and intensity of drought severity identified by the SPEI and SWDI from 1990 to 2022 showed different characteristics in the Brazilian semi-arid region from 1990 to 2022. The frequency of moderate, severe, and extreme drought ranged from 5% to 92%, the duration was mostly concentrated in 5-6 dry months. (2) The whole Brazilian semi-arid region exhibited an overall drying tendency. (3) The NDVI-derived vegetation in the Brazilian semi-arid ecosystems exhibited an overall decreased trend during 2004-2022, indicating a degrading trend of the vegetation cover. The region where degrading trend of NDVI was negatively correlated with SPEI accounted for approximately 13% of the region. (4) The frequency, and average duration of the flash drought were 21% concentrated in 6 pentads, during the region growing season. (5) The spatial and temporal trends with the significance test of the rainfall, air temperature, and SEVIRI radiance-based estimations suited well with those of the SPEI data. These research results were significant for the region to respond to and prevent drought through human-induced land degradation."
1,"As the effects of climate change become more visible, extreme weather events are becoming more common. The effects of flooding on health are understood but the long-term impact on the well-being of those affected need to be considered. This mixed methods secondary analysis of a cross-sectional survey examined the extent to which being flooded in the past is associated with ongoing concerns about flooding. Survey data were collected from residents in Hull 11 years after the initial flooding event. Respondents were asked about the floods in 2007 and their current level of concern about flooding. Ordinal logistic regression explored the effect of age and tenancy status as predictors of current concern. Textual data were analyzed using thematic content analysis. Responses were received from 457 households, of whom 202 (48%) were affected by flooding in 2007. A fifth of respondents were very concerned about future flooding. Those who were not flooded were significantly less concerned about the risk of future flooding (U = 33391.0, z = 5.89, p < 0.001). Those who reported negative health and wellbeing effects from the floods were significantly more concerned about future flooding than those whose health was not affected (U = 7830.5, z = 4.43, p < 0.001). Whilst some residents were reassured by the introduction of new flood alleviation schemes, others did not feel these were adequate, and worried about the impact of climate change. The financial and emotional impacts of the floods still resonated with families 11 years after the event, with many fearing they would not cope if it happened again. Despite the 2007 floods in Hull happening over a decade ago, many of those affected continue to experience high levels of anxiety when storms are forecast. Residents feel powerless to protect themselves, and many remain unconvinced by the presence of new flood alleviation schemes. However, with the ongoing threat of climate change, it may be that other residents are unrealistic in their expectation to be 'protected' from flood events. Therefore, public health agencies need to be able to mobilize organizations to come together to pro-actively support families affected by flooding, to ensure those in need do not fall through the gaps of public healthcare delivery."
1,"With many species predicted to respond to a changing climate by shifting their distribution to climatically suitable areas, the effectiveness of static protected areas (PAs) is in question. The Madagascan PA network area has quadrupled over the past 15 years, and, although conservation planning techniques were employed to prioritise suitable areas for protection during this process, climate change impacts were not considered. We make use of species distribution models for 750 Madagascan vertebrate species to assess the potential impacts of climate change on (1) species richness across Madagascar, (2) species gain, loss and turnover in Madagascar's PAs and (3) PA network representativeness. Results indicate that Madagascar is predicted to experience substantial shifts in species richness, with most PAs predicted to experience high rates of species turnover. Provided there are no barriers to species movements, the representativeness of the current PA network will remain high for the species that are predicted to survive changes in climate by 2070, suggesting that little benefit will be gained from establishing new PAs. However, this rests on the assumption of mobility through areas currently characterised by fragmentation and anthropogenic activity, something that will require considerable expansion in conservation efforts in order to achieve."
1,"Montane cloud forests (MCFs) are ecosystems frequently immersed in fog and are vital for the terrestrial hydrological cycle and biodiversity hotspots. However, the potential impacts of climate change, particularly intensified droughts and typhoons, on the persistence of ecosystems remain unclear. Our study conducted cross-scale assessments using 6-year (2016-2021) ground litterfall and 21-year (2001-2021) satellite greenness data (the Enhanced Vegetation Index [EVI] and the EVI anomaly change [Delta EVI% ]), gross primary productivity anomaly change (Delta GPP(%) ), and meteorological variables (the standardized precipitation index [SPI] and wind speed). We found a positive correlation between summer EVI and Delta GPP(%) with the SPI-3 (3-month time scale), while winter litterfall showed a negative correlation. Maximum typhoon daily wind speed was negatively correlated with summer and the monthly Delta EVI% and Delta GPP(%) . These findings suggest vegetation damage and productivity loss were related to drought and typhoon intensities. Furthermore, our analysis highlighted that chronic seasonal droughts had more pronounced impacts on MCFs than severe typhoons, implying that high precipitation and frequent fog immersion do not necessarily mitigate the ramifications of water deficit on MCFs but might render MCFs more sensitive and vulnerable to drought. A significant negative correlation between the summer and winter Delta EVI% and Delta GPP(%) of the same year, suggesting disturbance severity during summer may facilitate vegetation regrowth and carbon accumulation in the subsequent winter. This finding may be attributed to the ecological resilience of MCFs, which enables them to recover from the previous summer. In the long-term, our results indicated an increase in vegetation resilience over two decades in MCFs, likely driven by rising temperatures and elevated carbon dioxide levels. However, the enhancement of resilience might be overshadowed by the potential intensified droughts and typhoons in the future, potentially causing severe damage and insufficient recovery times for MCFs, thus raising concerns about uncertainties regarding their sustained resilience."
1,"Climate change is now estimated by some biologists to be the main threat to biodiversity, but doubts persist regarding which species are most at risk, and how best to adapt conservation management. Insects are expected to be highly responsive to climate change, because they have short life cycles which are strongly influenced by temperature. Insects also constitute the most diverse taxonomic group, carrying out biotic interactions of importance for ecological functioning and ecosystem services, so their responses to climate change are likely to be of considerable wider ecological significance. However, a review of recent published evidence of observed and modelled effects of climate change in ten high-ranking journals shows that comparatively few such studies have focused on insects. The majority of these studies are on Lepidoptera, because of the existence of detailed contemporary and historical datasets. These biases in published information may influence conclusions regarding the threat of climate change to insect biodiversity. Assessment of the vulnerability of insect species protected by the Bern Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats also emphasises that most information is available for the Lepidoptera. In the absence of the necessary data to carry out detailed assessments of the likely effects of climate change on most threatened insects, we consider how autecological studies may help to illuminate the potential vulnerability of species, and draw preliminary conclusions about the priorities for insect conservation and research in a changing climate."
1,"The past several decades have been marked by an increasing occurrence of climate events worldwide, and consequentially, there has been growing study of the health impacts in exposed populations. While a plethora of studies have investigated the impact of climate change on health or migration, there is a smaller body of literature where these three concepts overlap, and an even smaller proportion of these are qualitative studies. Thus, this review sought to assess the breadth of the available qualitative literature on climate change as a primary driver for migration and the related health contexts. Our findings highlight the nuances of climate-influenced migration decisions and the challenges experienced by populations who have left their homes because of climate change impacts. Further research should focus on the health experiences and migration decisions of those exposed to climate change hazards to identify appropriate multi-level interventions in disaster planning and response."
1,"On an annual basis, heat is the chief cause of weather-related deaths in the United States. Therefore, understanding the temperature structure where people live is important for reducing the health burden imposed by hot weather. This study focused on the air temperatures in the Detroit, Michigan, metropolitan region during the summer of 2009. An observational network was established that included 1) monitors sited in the backyards of residential participants, 2) National Weather Service standard observations, and 3) a network of monitors operated by the State of Michigan. Daily high and low temperatures were analyzed for spatial pattern, magnitude of spatial variability, and relationships with weather conditions. The existence of spatial variability was confirmed specifically during weather that was considered to be dangerous to public health. The relationships between temperature observations and distance to water, distance to city center, and local percent of impervious surface were investigated. The spatial variability during the daily low was typically stronger in magnitude and the spatial pattern was more consistent than were those during the daily high. The largest correlation with land-cover and location attributes was between values of percent of impervious surface and daily low temperatures. Daily high temperatures were most correlated with distance to water. Consistent with previous studies on spatial variability in urban environments, the results suggest a need for sensitivity to the spatially variable nature of exposure to heat events in both public health and urban planning. For example, these results showed that the downtown area experienced elevated temperatures during nights and that the eastern portions of Detroit experienced decreased temperatures during afternoons."
1,"Background: Together with the intensification of dry seasons in Neotropical regions, increasing deforestation is expected to exacerbate species extinctions, something that could lead to dramatic shifts in multitrophic communities and ecosystem functions. Recent studies suggest that the effects of habitat loss are greater where precipitation has decreased. Yet, experimental studies of the pure and interactive effects of drought and deforestation at ecosystem level remain scarce. Methods: Here, we used rainshelters and transplantation from rainforest to open areas of natural microcosms (the aquatic ecosystem and microbial-faunal food web found within the rainwater-filled leaves of tank bromeliads) to emulate drought and deforestation in a full factorial experimental design. We analysed the pure and interactive effects of our treatments on functional community structure (including microorganisms, detritivore and predatory invertebrates), and on leaf litter decomposition in tank bromeliad ecosystems. Results: Drought or deforestation alone had a moderate impact on biomass at the various trophic level, but did not eliminate species. However, their interaction synergistically reduced the biomass of all invertebrate functional groups and bacteria. Predators were the most impacted trophic group as they were totally eliminated, while detritivore biomass was reduced by about 95%. Fungal biomass was either unaffected or boosted by our treatments. Decomposition was essentially driven by microbial activity, and did not change across treatments involving deforestation and/ or drought. Conclusions: Our results suggest that highly resistant microorganisms such as fungi (plus a few detritivores) maintain key ecosystem functions in the face of drought and habitat change. We conclude that habitat destruction compounds the problems of climate change, that the impacts of the two phenomena on food webs are mutually reinforcing, and that the stability of ecosystem functions depends on the resistance of a core group of organisms. Assuming that taking global action is more challenging than taking local -regional actions, policy -makers should be encouraged to implement environmental action plans that will halt habitat destruction, to dampen any detrimental interactive effect with the impacts of global climate change."
1,"This article investigates the impact of weather-related disasters on inflation in the euro area over the period 1996-2021. Using a panel structural vector autoregression approach, we explore whether weather-related disasters have a significant and persistent effect on inflation, as well as the role that demand-side and supplyside channels play as drivers of inflation. We also analyse the heterogeneous effects of inflation on different product categories. Our results suggest that weather-related disasters have a positive, non-persistent effect on inflation. This reflects the prevalence of negative supply shock channels and positive demand shock channels over negative demand shock channels. We also find that weather-related disasters have more pronounced effects on the inflation of product categories that represent a higher proportion of the spending of low-income households, implying that disasters reinforce inflation inequality. Overall, our results suggest that, as the climate crisis deepens, it might become increasingly challenging for the European Central Bank to control inflation and its inequality effects."
0,"Food security is threatened by the global increase of human population, climate change, inequality of wealth distribution, the state of natural resources, peace and sustainability, among others. Aquaculture has become an important part of the food supply, hence contributing to food security. Sustainable fish production, which represents an important affordable protein supply, should therefore involve feed formulation and production techniques that are not dependent on fish meal as the protein source. It is on this basis that bioeconomy becomes very important to promote the resourceful use of biomass for feed, food, biomaterials, and bioenergy. This study presents housefly maggot meal as an efficient alternative protein source to fishmeal and a valuable bioresource. Clarias gariepinus fingerlings (male and female) were fed maggot meal supplemented diets for 24 weeks and we assessed their growth and gonadal development. The findings of this study revealed that maggot-meal-enhanced diets promoted growth and faster gonadal development in fish. Maggot meal represents a quality alternative protein source to fish meal and an excellent bioresource, which can help us attain sustainable aquaculture production."
0,"Legislators in the European Union have long been concerned with the environmental impact of farming activities and introduced so-called agri-environment schemes (AES) to mitigate adverse environmental effects and foster desirable ecosystem services in agriculture. This study combines economic theory with a novel machine learning method to identify the environmental effectiveness of AES at the farm level. We develop a set of more than 130 contextual predictors to assess the individual impact of participating in AES. Results from our empirical application for Southeast Germany suggest the existence of heterogeneous, but limited effects of agri-environment measures in several environmental dimensions such as climate change mitigation, clean water and soil health. By making use of Shapley values, we demonstrate the importance of considering the individual farming context in agricultural policy evaluation and provide important insights into the improved targeting of AES along several domains."
1,"Southern Vietnam is known as one of the most vulnerable areas to climate change in the world due to its low elevation and flat topography, heavy groundwater use, and dense population. This paper introduces hydrogeological conditions and critically reviews groundwater issues that southern Vietnam faces by summarizing previous literatures. Issues that this paper covers include groundwater use and associated phenomenon, acid sulfate soils, the occurrence of saline groundwaters, seawater intrusion, land subsidence, groundwater acidification, and groundwater contamination by nitrate, ammonium, and trace metals such as As, Fe, Mn, Al, Cd, and Pb. This paper shows that most of these issues are inter-related and essentially linked with the unique hydrogeological setting of the study area. However, many of these problems have also been triggered or aggravated by human activities that use water resources and land. Issues such as those of As contamination and groundwater acidification are connected with the aquifer characteristics that are generally confined and rich in organics and pyrite. However, groundwater salinization, acidification, groundwater level declining, land subsidence, and high heavy metal concentrations are in large part caused by human activities such as well installation and heavy groundwater abstraction. While previous studies have proposed artificial recharge as a promising means of mitigating groundwater issues in the study area, the development of techniques that help minimizing aquifer disturbances is also likely required."
1,"Reef-building corals are under tremendous physiological stress due to the changing climate and industrial pollution. Several studies have documented rapidly declining coral cover and reduced coral diversity in Indo-Pacific regions. The main threats to coral reefs are caused by increasing sea surface temperature (SST) and ocean acidification. However land-based sources of pollution in coastal regions can also contribute in rapid decline of coral cover. We report here a significant decrease in calcification rate (similar to 10-15%) in a scleractinian coral (Porites lutea) collected from a Lakshadweep (Kavaratti) island in the southeast Arabian Sea. Our observation is mainly based on high-resolution oxygen isotopic record and X-radiography of coral. To investigate seasonal changes, a monthly-scale SST record was developed by using oxygen isotopes. The observed reduction in the calcification rate of Porites coral from 1989 to 2003 A.D. is attributed to climate change and anthropogenic activity in the vicinity of coral growth. This decrease in calcification rate is consistent with the decline in growth rate of genus Porites from the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Such a reduction in calcification of Porites lutea appears to have been caused by the temperature stress, ocean acidification and local environmental pollution. However it is difficult to assign any one particular reason for the observed change. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved."
1,"Based on the records of drought and flood in Chinese historical documents and precipitation data during the instrumental period, and by using the five-grade classification method, this study reconstructs the drought and flood grades in the Hanjiang River Basin from 1426-2017 and analyzes their spatial and temporal variation characteristics. The results show that, on the centennial scale, drought and flood variation in the basin exhibited two dry periods (early fifteenth century to early sixteenth century, early twentieth century to the present) and one four-century long wet period (early sixteenth to early twentieth centuries), with multi-decadal drought and flood fluctuations within each period. Meanwhile, the variation shows some regional differences. For example, droughts and floods both occurred at high rates in the whole river basin during the twentieth century, with the increase in droughts relatively more remarkable in the upper reaches and the increase in floods more notable in the middle and lower reaches; throughout the study period, the drought and flood variability was larger in the upper reaches, but the drought and flood frequency was higher in the middle and lower reaches. In addition, there are a few quasi-cycles of the drought and flood variability in the middle and lower reaches, which include the quasi-cycles of 2-8 years, 10-30 years, 50 years, and 80-100 years, respectively. The upper reaches are slightly different, which have the quasi-cycles of 3-5 years, 10-30 years, and 70-80 years, respectively."
1,"Accounting for water stress-induced tree mortality in forest productivity models remains a challenge due to uncertainty in stress tolerance of tree populations. In this study, logistic regression models were developed to assess species- specific relationships between probability of mortality (P-m) and drought, drawing on 8.1 million observations of change in vital status (m) of individual trees across North America. Drought was defined by standardized (relative) values of soil water content (W-s,W- z) and reference evapotranspiration (ETr, z) at each field plot. The models additionally tested for interactions between the water-balance variables, aridity class of the site (AC), and estimated tree height (h). Considering drought improved model performance in 95 (80) per cent of the 64 tested species during calibration (cross-validation). On average, sensitivity to relative drought increased with site AC (i.e. aridity). Interaction between water-balance variables and estimated tree height indicated that drought sensitivity commonly decreased during early height development and increased during late height development, which may reflect expansion of the root system and decreasing whole-plant, leaf-specific hydraulic conductance, respectively. Across North America, predictions suggested that changes in the water balance caused mortality to increase from 1.1% yr(-1) in 1951 to 2.0% yr(-1) in 2014 (a net change of 0.9 +/- 0.3% yr(-1)). Interannual variation in mortality also increased, driven by increasingly severe droughts in 1988, 1998, 2006, 2007 and 2012. With strong confidence, this study indicates that water stress is a common cause of tree mortality. With weak-to-moderate confidence, this study strengthens previous claims attributing positive trends in mortality to increasing levels of water stress. This 'learn-as-we-go' approach - defined by sampling rare drought events as they continue to intensify - will help to constrain the hydraulic limits of dominant tree species and the viability of boreal and temperate forest biomes under continued climate change."
1,"As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to unfold around the world, the per unit area yield of the world's three major crops (i.e. maize, rice and wheat) decreased simultaneously for the first time in 20 years, and nearly 2.37 billion people faced food insecurity in 2020. Around 119-124 million people were pushed back into extreme poverty. Drought is one of the natural hazards that mostly affect agricultural production, and 2020 is one of the three warmest years on record. When the pandemic, economic recession and extreme climate change occur simultaneously, food crisis will often be exacerbated. Due to the limited research on the geographic modelling of crops and food security at the country level, we investigated the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic (COVID-19 incidence and mortality rate), economic (GDP and per capita GDP), climate (temperature change and drought), and their compound effects on three crop yields and food security in the world. On the basis of verifying the spatial autocorrelation, we used the global ordinary least squares model to select the explanatory variables. Then, geographically weighted regression (GWR) and multi-scale GWR (MGWR), were utilised to explore spatial non-stationary relationships. Results indicated that the MGWR was more efficient than the traditional GWR. On the whole, per capita GDP was the most important explanatory variable for most countries. However, the direct threats of COVID-19, temperature change and drought on crops and food se-curity were small and localised. This study is the first to utilise advanced spatial methods to analyse the impacts of nat-ural and human disasters on agriculture and food security in various countries, which can serve as a geographical guide for the World Food Organization, other relief agencies and policymakers to conduct food aid, health and medical as-sistance, financial support, climate change policy formulation, and anti-epidemic policy formulation."
1,"Delta regions are dynamic and rich environments with diverse economic activities and are often densely populated. Deltas are being shaped by multiple drivers, including changes in sediment delivery to the coastal zone due to catchment changes, especially construction of dams on major rivers, intensified agriculture and/or aquaculture, mining, urbanisation, human-induced subsidence, climate change, and sea-level rise. These environmental challenges have significant implications for the livelihoods of delta residents. Thus, the integrated assessment of deltas is now attracting the attention of the scientific research community to analyse and understand deltas as coupled biophysical and socioeconomic systems. Most attention has been focussed on the major deltas. This review focusses on the smaller but regionally significant Volta delta, Ghana. Previous scientific studies are limited, with more focus upstream on the Volta River basin. Many contemporary problems are recognised in the Volta delta, especially erosion and flooding of the open coast fringe, such as at the town of Keta. However, these problems are treated independently, which may hinder identifying the root causes and the most effective solutions. Equally, the emergence of new problems might be anticipated and hence better managed or even avoided. This paper reviews the present delta with emphasis on biophysical processes and socioeconomic characteristics and considers in particular the current drivers and challenges. With this information, a research agenda will be established for a more systemic approach to understanding the Volta delta, including its residents and development."
1,"Wildfires seasonal cycle, air temperature anomalies and precipitation in four latitudinal zones of Eastern Siberia are analyzed by multidecadal remote sensing data and CRU TS dataset. Features of latitudinal distribution of small fire patches (0.2-20 ha) are discussed. Trends and correlations between number of small fire patches, air temperature anomalies and precipitation in each latitudinal zone and month of fire season are analyzed. In general, it can be noted that in the northern part of the boreal zone of Eastern Siberia (zones 1, 2) over the past two decades there has been a noticeable increase in wildfire activity in the first half of summer, possibly related to the effects of climate warming. The dynamics of the trends of small-scale fires in the southern part (zones 3, 4) is ambiguous, requiring further research."
1,"Climate change is becoming one of the most crucial problems threatening the integrity of the global system. The impacts of climate change have been posing new threats to the states' interests, human prosperity and environmental sustainability. This article aims to analyze Turkiye's climate policies within the context of the sustainable security approach, which focuses on the balance between national, human and environmental security. The study argues that Turkiye's economic priorities prevail over its climate strategies. Moreover, Turkiye becomes more vulnerable and less resilient to the impacts of climate change as long as the country's carbon emissions continue to rise. Therefore, this article argues that if Turkiye considers the risks of climate change with a sustainable security approach; economic advantages, social prosperity and environmental protection for both present and future generations could be equivalently guaranteed."
1,"Alabama is a water rich state. Yet, agriculture is limited in both scale and productivity and the state regularly suffers from drought. Climate variability adds to this paradox even while water users, particularly farmers, have few coping mechanisms. In this paper, we argue that more significant than the water resource itself in Alabama is the governance structure of that resource. The riparian doctrine, as it stands, stymies effective management. The role of water doctrines, and resultant policy, is, therefore, crucial to enhancing decision-making opportunities for agricultural end-users in Alabama. After exploring different doctrine types as applied across the states we conclude that a move towards regulated riparianism consistent with the American Society of Civil Engineers Regulated Riparian Water Code (2004) would enhance opportunities for both the state and agriculturalists to cope with variable water supply conditions while maximizing environmental benefits. The paper then concludes with a review of the primary objectives of the Water Code and key places where Alabama's Water Code would need revision to meet these objectives."
1,"Observations and climate projections suggest a larger increase in tropical cyclone (TC)-induced rainfall than that can be explained by the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship of 7% increase in vapor content for each 1 degrees C degree rise in temperature. However, these studies using diverse data sources and methods over various periods show inconsistencies regarding the location of this increase - whether in the TC inner core or outer regions - and offer differing explanations for the reported trends. This study uses the Pseudo-global warming methodology on simulations of 117 western North Pacific TCs making landfall in Southeast Asia to investigate changes in TC rainfall structure by the end of the century under the SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-7.0 scenarios. Specifically, it tests the sensitivity of changing trends to various analysis methods used in previous studies and identifies the underlying physical mechanisms driving these changes. The findings indicate an amplified increase in rainfall in the TC inner core across all future scenarios, along with potentially decreased rainfall in the outer region under certain future climate conditions. Among TC categories, Supertyphoons exhibit the most significant increased rainfall across future states. Changes in TC primary and secondary circulations, TC structure, and the convergence of heat and moisture are the main factors shaping future rainfall patterns, outweighing the effects of changes in atmospheric and convective stability. Tropical cyclone (TC)-related rainfall is increasing with global warming. Typically, a 1 degrees C increase in temperature leads to about a 7% increase in the atmosphere's water vapor holding capacity. However, the rise in TC rainfall outpaces this rate. Observations indicate this enhanced increase occurs in the TC outer region due to greater environmental moisture. Contrarily, modeling future projections suggest this concentrates in the inner core due to intensified TCs. This study analyzes a large data set of 819 simulations from 117 TCs making landfall in Southeast Asia to capture changes in future rainfall patterns under two contemporary climate change scenarios. Our findings reveal that the enhanced increase occurs in the TC inner core in all future states, while rainfall in the outer region decreases under specific climate conditions. Supertyphoons generate the heaviest rainfall, with minimal variations observed across climate scenarios. Variations of all dynamic and thermodynamic factors closely tied to TC rainfall are investigated to provide a comprehensive picture of the physics behind the changes. The interplay between TC dynamics (e.g., primary and secondary circulations), TC structure, and thermodynamic conditions (e.g., convergence of moisture, and temperatures), plays a critical role in the changing behaviors of TC rainfall. Rainfall increases in the cyclone's inner core across all future states but decreases in the outer region under specific states Variations in cyclone circulations, structure, convergence of moisture and heat in future climates drive rainfall changing patterns Supertyphoons cause the heaviest rainfall compared to other categories, with slight variations noted across climate conditions"
1,"Climate change is threatening the persistence of coral reef ecosystems resulting in both chronic and acute impacts which include higher frequency and severity of cyclones, warming sea surface temperatures, and ocean acidification. This study measured net ecosystem primary production (NEP) and net ecosystem calcification (NEC) on a reef flat after the most severe El Nino-driven mass bleaching event on Australia's Great Barrier Reef (GBR) in 2016 and again in 2018 after another consecutive bleaching event in 2017. Our results indicate temporal changes in reef metabolism likely as result of both the continuing press disturbance of ocean acidification and severe pulse disturbances (cyclones and bleaching events). In 2016, NEP was within the range of values reported in past studies, however, it declined in 2018. NEC over a 12-h period was lower in 2016 than 2018; but when compared with past studies there was a severe decline in daytime net calcification from 2008-2009, to 2016 followed by an increase in 2018 (but still NEC remained lower than values reported in 2008-2009). Conversely, nighttime net calcification was similar to that reported in 2009 indicating nighttime dissolution did not increase over the past decade. Overall coral cover remained stable following recent disturbances, however, algal turf was the dominant benthic component on the reef flat, while calcifiers (corals and calcified algae) were minor components (<20% of total benthic cover). This study documented temporal changes in community function following major pulse disturbances (bleaching events and cyclones) within the context of ongoing OA at the same location over the last decade. Repeated pulse disturbances could jeopardize the persistence of the reef flat as a net calcifying entity, with the potential for cascading effects on other ecosystem services."
0,"Plant-animal interactions are fundamentally important in ecosystems, but have often been ignored by studies of climate-change impacts on biodiversity. Here, we present a trait-based framework for predicting the responses of interacting plants and animals to climate change. We distinguish three pathways along which climate change can impact interacting species in ecological communities: (i) spatial and temporal mismatches in the occurrence and abundance of species, (ii) the formation of novel interactions and secondary extinctions, and (iii) alterations of the dispersal ability of plants. These pathways are mediated by three kinds of functional traits: response traits, matching traits, and dispersal traits. We propose that incorporating these traits into predictive models will improve assessments of the responses of interacting species to climate change."
1,"The impacts of inland flooding caused by tropical cyclones (TCs), including loss of life, infrastructure disruption, and alteration of natural landscapes, have increased over recent decades. While these impacts are well documented, changes in TC precipitation extremes- the proximate cause of such inland flooding-have been more difficult to detect. Here, we present a latewood tree-ring-based record of seasonal (June 1 through October 15) TC precipitation sums (sigma TCP) from the region in North America that receives the most sigma TCP: coastal North and South Carolina. Our 319-y-long sigma TCP reconstruction reveals that sigma TCP extremes (>0.95 quantile) have increased by 2 to 4 mm/decade since 1700 CE, with most of the increase occurring in the last 60 y. Consistent with the hypothesis that TCs are moving slower under anthropogenic climate change, we show that seasonal sigma TCP along the US East Coast are positively related to seasonal average TC duration and TC translation speed."
0,"Resilience is widely accepted as the capacities implemented to manage climate change. Exploring how individual resilience can be enhanced to better prepare residents for natural disasters, such as urban flooding, is therefore necessary. Environmental cognitions that provide psychological and physiological benefits to people by adding motivation to interact with the place are factors influencing people's resilience-oriented behaviors but have largely been ignored in existing research. As such, this study establishes a framework for the concept of individual resilience to urban flooding. Gongming, a sub-district of Shenzhen, China, is considered the case area wherein individual resilience and its environmental determinants are evaluated. Through hierarchical linear modeling, the environmental determinants of individual resilience at the individual and community levels are identified. At the individual level, the main factors are a few green spaces, low quality of the built environment, mutual distrust and lack of well-being perceived by residents. At the community level, the results suggest that the social environment, particularly its gatedness, is pivotal to individual resilience. This study offers an approach for analyzing factors that limit individual resilience from the environmental perspective, thereby providing a basis for formulating corresponding policy recommendations to effectively improve resilience through urban planning."
1,"Climate change predictions forecast extended drought periods, which are expected to pose an enhanced risk to forest trees. Here, we investigated the drought response and fitness traits in European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) in response to a severe progressive drought. The capability of three beech provenances from habitats differing in annual precipitation (544, 665, and 766 mm year(-1)) to cope with drought was compared in a common garden experiment using beech seedlings. Soil and plant water status, maximum quantum yield of PSII, growth and biomass partitioning, stomatal conductance, and transcript abundance pattern of the kinase, Open Stomata 1 (OST1), of control (well-watered) and drought-treated (water withheld) plants from each provenance were repeatedly measured during a 60-day drought experiment. The lowest precipitation provenance displayed a more isohydric phenotype with a prompt stomatal closure, increased OST1 levels, high water potential and leaf water content, and a decrement in the maximum quantum yield of PSII. The other two provenances showed a more anisohydric stomatal regulation with a slow and delayed stomatal closure and a decrease in the water status. These findings suggest that intraspecific variations in beech for diverging drought resistance strategies exist and might be mediated by differences in the abscisic acid signaling pathway. The higher precipitation provenance maintained high quantum yield of PSII, and water potentials above -2.0 MPa for a longer period of time than the other two provenances, and consequently, mortality was delayed in this provenance. We concluded that lower precipitation adapted plants employ a drought resistance strategy suitable for the moderate drought, whereas the higher precipitation habitat plants revealed mechanisms, which could be better suited to cope with more severe drought events."
1,"Climate change has important implications on human health, affecting almost every system in the body. Multiple studies have raised the possibility of climate change impacting eye health. In this review, we aimed to summarize current literature on the impact of air pollution and climate change on eye health. We performed a search in four different databases, including Medline, Scopus, Cochrane, and Web of Sciences databases. The search strategy combined terms regarding eye health and environmental/climate changes. The outcome of interest included all eye conditions. The search yielded 2,051 unique articles. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 61 articles were included in this systematic review with data covering 2,620,030 participants. Most studies originated from China, India, South Korea, and USA. Climate change adversely affected different eye conditions, with ocular surface diseases (e.g., conjunctivitis and dry eye) being most affected. Moreover, higher particulate matter (PM) was the most widely assessed pollutant and was adversely associated with the majority of eye conditions, increasing the burden on patients and healthcare providers. We found a low frequency of publications related to the delivery of eye care and its impact on climate change in countries with high air pollution and climate change burden."
1,"Purpose of Review There is clear evidence that the earth's climate is changing, largely from anthropogenic causes. Flooding and tropical cyclones have clear impacts on human health in the United States at present, and projections of their health impacts in the future will help inform climate policy, yet to date there have been few quantitative climate health impact projections. Recent Findings Despite a wealth of studies characterizing health impacts of floods and tropical cyclones, many are better suited for qualitative, rather than quantitative, projections of climate change health impacts. However, a growing number have features that will facilitate their use in quantitative projections, features we highlight here. Further, while it can be difficult to project how exposures to flood and tropical cyclone hazards will change in the future, climate science continues to advance in its capabilities to capture changes in these exposures, including capturing regional variation. Summary Developments in climate epidemiology and climate science are opening new possibilities in projecting the health impacts of floods and tropical cyclones under a changing climate."
1,"Rising sea levels due to climate change are expected to negatively impact the fresh-water resources of small islands. The effects of climate change on Shelter Island, New York State (USA), a small sandy island, were investigated using a variable-density transient groundwater flow model. Predictions for changes in precipitation and sea-level rise over the next century from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2007 report were used to create two future climate scenarios. In the scenario most favorable to fresh groundwater retention, consisting of a 15% precipitation increase and 0.18-m sea-level rise, the result was a 23-m seaward movement of the fresh-water/salt-water interface, a 0.27-m water-table rise, and a 3% increase in the fresh-water lens volume. In the scenario supposedly least favorable to groundwater retention, consisting of a 2% precipitation decrease and 0.61-m sea-level rise, the result was a 16-m landward movement of the fresh-water/salt-water interface, a 0.59-m water-table rise, and a 1% increase in lens volume. The unexpected groundwater-volume increase under unfavorable climate change conditions was best explained by a clay layer under the island that restricts the maximum depth of the aquifer and allows for an increase in fresh-water lens volume when the water table rises."
1,"This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the hydrological effects and flood risks of the Hirakud Reservoir, considering different CMIP6 climate change scenarios. Using the HEC-HMS and HEC-RAS models, the study evaluates future flow patterns and the potential repercussions of dam breaches. The following summary of the work: firstly, the HEC-HMS model is calibrated and validated using daily stage-discharge observations from the Basantpur station. With coefficient of determination (R2) values of 0.764 and 0.858 for calibration and validation, respectively, the model demonstrates satisfactory performance. Secondly, The HEC-HMS model predicts future flow for the Hirakud Reservoir under three climate change scenarios (SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5) and for three future periods (near future, mid future and far future). Thirdly, by analyzing time-series hydrographs, the study identifies peak flooding events. In addition, the HEC-RAS model is used to assess the effects of dam breaches. Downstream of the Hirakud Dam, the analysis highlights potential inundation areas and depth variations. The study determines the following inundation areas for the worst flood scenarios: 3651.52 km2, 2931.46 km2 and 4207.6 km2 for the near-future, mid-future and far-future periods, respectively. In addition, the utmost flood depths for these scenarios are determined to be 31 m, 29 m and 39 m for the respective future periods. The study area identifies 105 vulnerable villages and several towns. This study emphasizes the importance of contemplating climate change scenarios and implementing proactive measures to mitigate the peak flooding events in the Hirakud reservoir region."
1,"Too little is known about changes in plant reproduction caused by modified regimes of extreme weather events. While it is important to understand how climatic extremes affect physiological processes in leaves or roots, on a long scale, it is successful reproduction, which ultimately matters. In an experimental grassland, we investigated the vegetative response and reproductive fitness of the grasses Holcus lanatus and Arrhenathentm elatius to drought and heavy rainfall. We perform a quantitative analysis of biomass, number of flowers per inflorescences, seed weight, germination rate and establishment. Target species were sampled from three grassland assemblages (two species-communities, four-species communities with and without a legume). H. lanatus reacted with a reduced number of flowers per inflorescences and a reduced germinability to climatic extremes. Nevertheless, H. lanatus reacted with an increased seedling establishment in face of extreme weather events. However, the two investigated grass species responded differently in the same experimental communities. A. elatius reached a higher number of flowers per inflorescences, higher germination rate, and higher establishment when exposed to drought compared to control. Yet, heavy rainfall and respective water-saturated soil conditions influenced both grasses more negatively, i.e., leading to a lower number of flowers per inflorescences, germination rate and reproductive biomass, than extreme drought. This study illustrates that the impact on reproduction during short periods needs consideration when long-term responses of grassland ecosystems to climate change are assessed."
1,"Analyses of extreme flooding in Austria is performed using daily discharge time series from 27 stations over the period 1951-2006. The main research questions revolve around: (1) temporal non-stationarities in the flood record, (2) upper tail and scaling properties of the flood peak records, and (3) relation between magnitude and frequency of flooding and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Two datasets are derived from the daily discharge time series: annual maximum daily discharge and peaks-over-threshold (POT) data. The validity of the stationarity assumption in the annual maximum discharge record is assessed by investigating the presence of abrupt and slowly varying changes using nonparametric tests. The time series are tested for abrupt changes both in the mean and variance of the flood peak distributions by means of the Pettitt test. The presence of monotonic trends is investigated by means of the Mann-Kendall and Spearman tests. Violations of the stationarity assumption are associated with abrupt rather than gradual changes. These step changes generally involve river regulation through construction of dams or other major engineering works. It is not possible to make conclusive statements about the presence of an anthropogenic climate change signal in the flood peak record. Similar conclusions are obtained when focussing on the frequency of POT floods. The Generalised Extreme Value distribution is used to study the upper tail and scaling properties of annual maximum daily discharge records. The location and scale parameters exhibit power-law behaviour as a function of drainage area. The shape parameters indicate that the flood peak distributions for Austria have a heavy tail. Non-stationary modelling of the annual maximum daily discharge and POT time series is used to explore the relation between flood magnitude and frequency and NAO. The results indicate that NAO is a significant covariate in explaining the magnitude and frequency of occurrence of flooding over a large part of Austria.

1,"Despite its well-established negative impacts on society and biodiversity, eutrophication continues to be one of the most pervasive anthropogenic influences along the freshwater to marine continuum. The interaction between eutrophication and climate change, particularly climate warming, was explicitly focused upon a decade ago by Brian Moss and others in Allied attack: climate change and eutrophication, which called for an integrated response to both problems, given their apparent synergy. In this review, we summarise advances in the theoretical framework and empirical research on this issue and analyse the current understanding of the major drivers and mechanisms by which climate change can enhance eutrophication, and vice versa, with a particular focus on shallow lakes. Climate change can affect nutrient loading through changes at the catchment and landscape levels by affecting hydrological patterns and fire frequency and through temperature effects on nutrient cycling. Biotic communities and their interactions can also be directly and indirectly affected by climate change, leading to an overall weakening of resilience to eutrophication impacts. Increasing empirical evidence now indicates several mechanisms by which eutrophying aquatic systems can increasingly act as important sources of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, particularly methane. We also highlight potential feedback among eutrophication, cyanobacterial blooms, and climate change. Facing both challenges simultaneously is more pressing than ever. Meaningful and strong measures at the landscape and waterbody levels are therefore required if we are to ensure ecosystem resilience and safe water supply, conserve biodiversity, and decrease the carbon footprint of freshwaters."
1,"This study explores the respective contributions of precipitation and temperature variability to the trends of the duration and severity of the dryness/wetness, and takes the Pearl River basin (PRB) in the southern China as a study example. The Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPED, which uses the monthly precipitation and temperature as input variables, was calculated based on the monthly precipitation and temperature records of 42 meteorological gauges during 1960-2015 in the PRB. The run theory was then applied to extract the dryness/wetness characteristics including the drought duration and severity and the wetting duration and severity. In addition, a simple algorithm for quantifying the respective contribution of the precipitation and temperature variability to the dryness/wetness trends was proposed; the algorithm determines the changes in the slopes magnitude (linear regression) for the dryness/wetness characteristics that were identified from different SPEI scenarios (i.e. the precipitation and temperature groups of observed, one of them detrended, and both detrended) using the run theory method. Our results showed that the increasing trends of drought duration and severity were more apparent in the northwestern areas with high elevation (> 1000 m) than the southeastern areas with low elevation (< 500 m), whereas the change trends of the wetness duration and severity exhibited opposite results. The variability of the precipitation and temperature played different roles in the trends of the dryness/wetness characteristics; the effects of the temperature changes on these trends were larger than the effects of the precipitation changes, i.e., an increase in the temperature clearly affected the change trends of duration and severity for the dryness/wetness. In the PRB, a slight increase in the average precipitation resulted in decreases in the trends of drought duration and severity of 9.89% and 19.63% respectively and increases in the trends of wetting duration and severity of 1.59% and 11.52%. However, a marked increase in the average temperature resulted in increases in the trends of drought duration, drought severity, wetting duration, and wetting severity of 48.38%, 55.16%, 46.21%, and 34.40%, respectively. Thus, in light of global warming, the government should focus more attention on the evolution of the dryness/wetness characteristics because increases in severe drought occurrences and flood severities and secondary disasters may result in more severe losses."
1,"By 2050, global livestock production is expected to double-growing faster than any other agricultural sub-sector-with most of this increase taking place in the developing world. As the United Nation's four-hundred-page report, Livestock's Long Shadow: Environmental Issues and Options, documents, livestock production is now one of three most significant contributors to environmental problems, leading to increased greenhouse gas emissions, land degradation, water pollution, and increased health problems. The paper draws on the UN report as well as a flurry of other recently published studies in order to demonstrate the effect of intensive livestock production on global warming and on people's health. The paper's goal is to outline the problems caused by intensive livestock farming and analyze a number of possible solutions, including legislative changes and stricter regulations, community mobilizing, and consumers choosing to decrease their demand for animal products."
1,"Climate change has profound implications for global ecosystems, particularly in mountainous regions where species distribution and composition are highly sensitive to changing environmental conditions. Understanding the potential impacts of climate change on native forest species is crucial for effective conservation and management strategies. Despite numerous studies on climate change impacts, there remains a need to investigate the future dynamics of climate suitability for key native forest species, especially in specific mountainous sections. This study aims to address this knowledge gap by examining the potential shifts in altitudinal range and suitability for forest species in Italy's mountainous regions. By using species distribution models, through MaxEnt we show the divergent impacts among species and scenarios, with most species experiencing a contraction in their altitudinal range of suitability whereas others show the potential to extend beyond the current tree line. The Northern and North-Eastern Apennines exhibit the greatest and most widespread impacts on all species, emphasizing their vulnerability. Our findings highlight the complex and dynamic nature of climate change impacts on forest species in Italy. While most species are projected to experience a contraction in their altitudinal range, the European larch in the Alpine region and the Turkey oak in the Apennines show potential gains and could play significant roles in maintaining wooded populations. The tree line is generally expected to shift upward, impacting the European beech-a keystone species in the Italian mountain environment-negatively in the Alpine arc and Northern Apennines, while showing good future suitability above 1,500 meters in the Central and Southern Apennines. Instead, the Maritime pine emerges as a promising candidate for the future of the Southern Apennines. The projected impacts on mountain biodiversity, particularly in terms of forest population composition, suggest the need for comprehensive conservation and management strategies. The study emphasizes the importance of using high-resolution climate data and considering multiple factors and scenarios when assessing species vulnerability. The findings have implications at the local, regional, and national levels, emphasizing the need for continued efforts in producing reliable datasets and forecasts to inform targeted conservation efforts and adaptive management strategies in the face of climate change."
1,"Ocean acidification from the uptake of anthropogenic carbon is simulated for the industrial period and IPCC SRES emission scenarios A2 and B1 with a global coupled carbon cycle-climate model. Earlier studies identified seawater saturation state with respect to aragonite, a mineral phase of calcium carbonate, as a key variable governing impacts on corals and other shell-forming organisms. Globally in the A2 scenario, water saturated by more than 300%, considered suitable for coral growth, vanishes by 2070 AD (CO2 approximate to 630 ppm), and the ocean volume fraction occupied by saturated water decreases from 42% to 25% over this century. The largest simulated pH changes worldwide occur in Arctic surface waters, where hydrogen ion concentration increases by up to 185% (Delta pH=-0.45). Projected climate change amplifies the decrease in Arctic surface mean saturation and pH by more than 20%, mainly due to freshening and increased carbon uptake in response to sea ice retreat. Modeled saturation compares well with observation-based estimates along an Arctic transect and simulated changes have been corrected for remaining model-data differences in this region. Aragonite undersaturation in Arctic surface waters is projected to occur locally within a decade and to become more widespread as atmospheric CO2 continues to grow. The results imply that surface waters in the Arctic Ocean will become corrosive to aragonite, with potentially large implications for the marine ecosystem, if anthropogenic carbon emissions are not reduced and atmospheric CO2 not kept below 450 ppm."
1,"Droughts exert widespread impacts on both natural and social systems, and there is accumulating evidence that this situation may worsen in the context of global warming. Despite the importance of assessing changes in droughts to understand their potential future impacts on society, studies are unevenly distributed worldwide. In this study, utilizing bias-corrected CMIP6 simulations and a standard precipitation-evaporation index based approach, we quantified expected changes in future drought properties across 735 Brazilian catchments under SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios. Beyond evaluating the statistical properties of future droughts, we assessed their occurrence under both land use and water demand perspectives and propose a new framework to better understand their link with changes in long- and short-term conditions of precipitation ( P ) and potential evapotranspiration ( PET ). Our results indicate that drought events are projected to become more frequent and severe in the future, with high CMIP6 model agreement. According to the SSP5-8.5 scenario, at least half of Brazilian cropland and pasture areas will experience an increase of over 30% in drought properties by the end of the century. Furthermore, among the 85% of catchments expected to experience more severe droughts, nearly 90% are also projected to exhibit increased water demand, which will likely exacerbate future water scarcity. The investigation of the relationship between droughts changes and climate variables suggests that catchments with augmented droughts in the future will likely exhibit increased long-term average PET and P -variability, but not necessarily long-term average P . For instance, over 50% of evaluated Brazilian catchments are expected to experience an intensification of drought properties even with increases in P mean . We believe this study may contribute (a) to improve Brazilian water resiliency by helping achieve the objectives of the National Water Security Plan and (b) to deepen our understanding of droughts in an uncertain future."
0,"Awareness is growing that stopping climate change requires a shift towards building a low-carbon society that would provide substantial opportunities and ensure continued economic growth and sustainable development. The implementation of the system of institutions, legal and procedural instruments established for trading greenhouse gas emission will contribute to balanced decision-making at the macroeconomic level, thus contributing to protection of the environment and public health; to minimizing the environmental impact of economic activities (such as in energy sector, industrial production, operation of transportation, fossil fuel burning in the institutional, commercial, residential sectors, in agriculture, forestry and fisheries, in industrial processes and products use, in agriculture, land use, land-use change and forestry and in waste sectors). There is no doubt that expenditure for combating negative consequences is much greater than expenditure for prevention of environmental pollution. The analysis of national legislation allows highlighting a number of its elements which, to some extent, are specific to more efficient monitoring, reporting and verification of greenhouse gas emissions; however, these elements, as separate items can't reduce greenhouse gas emission, do not allow assessment of their application taking into account the provisions of the UNFCCC, the Kyoto Protocol, the Paris Agreement and the EU decisions adopted thereunder."
1,"Trends of the three hydro-meteorological variables, including precipitation, temperature, and river discharge have been studied to detect the impacts of climate change on water resources in western Caspian Sea region, Iran. We used Kendall's tau, Spearman's rho, Sen's slope estimator, and Mann-Kendall approaches to detecting the annual and seasonal trends over the period 1981-2010. The nonparametric tests detected statistically significant decreasing trends in all of the hydrometric stations. In general, magnitude of an annual downward trend in the hydrometric stations was 2.17 m(3)/s per decade at the 5% significance level. As the results of the Pettitt test for detecting abrupt changes (jumps), the change points (or trends started) in river flow series were found in all hydrometric stations in the years of 1994-1999 at the significance level of 0.05%. Meanwhile, the outputs exhibited that majority of the annual and seasonally precipitation trends were increasing in contrast to the river discharge trends. Furthermore, on average, magnitude of annual temperature increasing trend was found (+) 0.43 degrees C per decade at the 0.05 significant level. Abrupt changes in the annual temperature as same as river flow series were at the 1990s over the period 1981-2010. The Pearson correlation was used to explore the relationships between river flow, temperature, and precipitation time series. Finally, the high correlation was obtained from the area-averaged temperature and discharge series at the autumn and annual time series with the value of the (-) 59 and (-) 50%. It is concluded that decreasing the river discharge might be related to increasing temperature and decreasing precipitation and anthropogenic changes in the study area."
1,"The future ice dynamical contribution to sea level rise (SLR) from 199 ice shelf nourishing drainage basins of the Antarctic Peninsula Ice Sheet is simulated, using the British Antarctic Survey Antarctic Peninsula Ice Sheet Model. Simulations of the grounded ice sheet include response to ice shelf collapse, estimated by tracking thermal ice shelf viability limits in 14 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change global climate models ensemble temperature projections. Grounding line retreat in response to ice shelf collapse is parameterized with a new multivariate linear regression model utilizing a range of glaciological and geometric predictor variables. Multimodel means project SLR up to 9.4 mm sea level equivalent (SLE) by 2200, and up to 19 mm SLE by 2300. Rates of SLR from individual drainage basins throughout the peninsula are similar to 2100, yet diverge between 2100 and 2300 due to individual basin characteristics. Major contributors to SLR are the outlet glaciers feeding southern George VI Ice Shelf, accounting for >75% of total SLR in some model runs. Ice sheet thinning induced by ice-shelf removal is large (up to similar to 500 m), especially in Palmer Land in the southern Antarctic Peninsula, and may propagate as far as 135 kminland. These results emphasize the importance of the ice dynamical contribution to future sea level of the APIS on decadal to centennial timescales."
1,"The Norway spruce is one of the most important tree species in Europe. This tree species has been put under considerable pressure due to the ongoing impacts of climate change. Meanwhile, frequent droughts and pest outbreaks are reported as the main reason for its dieback, resulting in severe forest cover loss. Such was the case with Norway spruce forests within the Kopaonik National Park (NP) in Serbia. This study aims to quantify, spatially and temporally, forest cover loss and to evaluate the sensitivity of various vegetation indices (VIs) in detecting drought-induced response and predicting the dieback of Norway spruce due to long-lasting drought effects in the Kopaonik NP. For this purpose, we downloaded and processed a large number of Landsat 7 (ETM+), Landsat 8 (OLI), and Sentinel 2 (MSI) satellite imagery acquired from 2009 to 2022. Our results revealed that forest cover loss was mainly driven by severe drought in 2011 and 2012, which was later significantly influenced by bark beetle outbreaks. Furthermore, various VIs proved to be very useful in monitoring and predicting forest health status. In summary, the drought-induced response detected using various VIs provides valuable insights into the dynamics of forest cover change, with implications for monitoring and conservation efforts of Norway spruce forests in the Kopaonik NP."
1,"Given natural variation in weather conditions and increased risk of drought associated with climate change, understanding how birds respond to fluctuations in precipitation is a necessary step toward development of more-effective, long-term management strategies for species of conservation concern. We compared behaviors and reproductive output of the federally endangered Vireo atricapilla (Black-capped Vireo, hereafter Vireo) during an extreme drought event and a year with moderate rainfall. During the drought, Vireos had lower pairing and territory success, delayed nest initiation, fewer re-nesting attempts, and lower nest-success. Brood parasitism by Molothrus ater (Brown-headed Cowbirds), which is one of the main threats to Vireo population persistence, was also greater during the drought year. Nest placement varied between years, with Vireos using the evergreen Juniperus asheii (Ashe Juniper) as a nest substrate more often when conditions were dry and the deciduous Diospyros texana (Texas Persimmon) under moderate conditions. Removal of Ashe Juniper and Brown-headed Cowbirds from Vireo habitat are common management practices used to support Vireo conservation efforts. Our results suggest that regional weather patterns should be considered when making decisions regarding Ashe Juniper removal. In addition, increased Brown-headed Cowbird removal may be warranted in dry areas during drought years."
1,"Energy and fuel demands, which are currently met primarily using fossil fuels, are expected to increase substantially in the coming decades. Burning fossil fuels results in the increase of net atmospheric CO2 and climate change, hence there is widespread interest in identifying sustainable alternative fuel sources. Biofuels are one such alternative involving the production of biodiesel and bioethanol from plants. However, the environmental impacts of biofuels are not well understood. First generation biofuels (i.e. those derived from edible biomass including crops such as maize and sugarcane) require extensive agricultural areas to produce sufficient quantities to replace fossil fuels, resulting in competition with food production, increased land clearing and pollution associated with agricultural production and harvesting. Microalgal production systems are a promising alternative that suffer from fewer environmental impacts. Here, we evaluate the potential impacts of microalgal production systems on biodiversity compared to first generation biofuels, through a review of studies and a comparison of environmental pressures that directly or indirectly impact biodiversity. We also compare the cultivation area required to meet gasoline and distillate fuel oil demands globally, accounting for spatial variation in productivity and energy consumption. We conclude that microalgal systems exert fewer pressures on biodiversity per unit of fuel generated compared to first generation biofuels, mainly because of reductions in direct and indirect land-use change, water consumption if water is recycled, and no application of pesticides. Further improvements of technologies and production methods, including optimization of productivities per unit area, colocation with wastewater systems and industrial CO2 sources, nutrient and water recycling and use of coproducts for internal energy generation, would further increase CO2 savings. Overall pollution reductions can be achieved through increased energy efficiencies, along with nutrient and water recycling. Microalgal systems provide strong potential for helping in meeting global energy demands sustainably."
1,"The persistence of populations of marine organisms depends on the success of the dual processes of reproduction and recruitment. The production of offspring alone is inconsequential unless larvae and propagules can recruit, which often entails a period of development and distribution in the water column and subsequent selection of appropriate habitats. For fish, this may mean drifting in currents before responding to particular habitat cues. For corals and other benthic invertebrates, larvae must undergo site selection, settlement and metamorphosis into the juvenile form, and survivorship is directly linked to site choice and environmental conditions. Both biotic and abiotic factors affect population replenishment success, and hence, anthropogenic influences such as pollution, sedimentation and climate change can negatively affect critical processes such as reproductive synchronization in spawning species, successful embryological development, appropriate site selection, settlement, metamorphosis and in the case of reef building corals, acquisition of the required zooxanthellae partner. Effective management practices are essential for ensuring the persistence of populations of coral reef organisms of economic, cultural and ecological value."
0,"This study evaluates the effect of cloud seeding on the increase of runoff or securing of additional water resources. Unlike previous studies, this study concentrates more on the change of various components of the hydrologic processes. Both the event-based analysis and the annual analysis are conducted to evaluate the change of these components. The Boryeong Dam Basin in Korea is considered as a study basin. The WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting) model is used in the cloud seeding simulation, while the PRMS (Precipitation Runoff Modeling System) model is used in the rainfall-runoff analysis. The target years of this study are 2018 and 2019. As results, the event-based analysis shows that the infiltration, effective rainfall, interflow, and direct runoff are increased relatively more among the eight rainfall-runoff components considered in this study. In particular, the increase of interflow is noticeable. More than 60 % of the increased rainfall is found to contribute to the runoff increase. In the annual analysis, this ratio is found to become even higher. The ratio is estimated to be more than 90 %, which is mostly due to the contribution of baseflow. As important factors controlling the effectiveness of cloud seeding, the effects of antecedent soil moisture and threshold daily rainfall depth on the increase of total runoff are also evaluated. The results show that wet soil condition is more favorable to the successful cloud seeding experiment to secure additional water resources. Also, it is confirmed that the cloud seeding experiment can be more effective when the daily rainfall is more than 20 mm. Finally, the results of this study imply the efficiency of cloud seeding and its economic values are potentially high."
0,"The boreal forest is the largest intact forest in the world, and a refuge for species experiencing range retractions as a consequence of climate and landscape change. Yet, large tracts of the boreal forest are threatened by the cumulative impacts of climate change, natural resource extraction, agriculture, and urbanization, perhaps warranting a shift in focus from biodiversity conservation in intact wilderness to that in anthropologically modified landscapes. We investigated landscape features that influence the distribution of the endangered little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus) in an urbanizing boreal landscape at two spatial scales. We hypothesized that little brown bat activity would be influenced by proximity to available building roosts, because roosts are a potential limiting factor for boreal bats. Secondarily, we predicted that bats would use potential foraging habitat, such as waterbodies, and would avoid young, cluttered forests at the landscape scale. We conducted acoustic surveys of bat activity at 210 sites distributed across the study area in Yukon, Canada, within 1-km grid cells. We tested a priori hypotheses with a set of candidate regression models, accounting for spatial autocorrelation. Our hypothesis about the relative importance of anthropogenic roosts was not supported. Little brown bats were equally active in urban areas (high building density) and rural areas (low building density), perhaps because roosts were adequately available throughout the region. Instead, habitat use was driven by the distribution of potential foraging habitat, particularly waterbodies, which are important sources of aerial insect prey. Little brown bats also avoided young (<= 100-yr-old) forest at the landscape scale (including areas regenerating after fire), which may have been poor foraging or roosting habitat, and used areas with a smaller agricultural and industrial footprint. Our results suggest that waterbodies and mature forest are important little brown bat habitats that should be protected from urban encroachment. Proactive conservation of important habitat for species at risk is still possible throughout much of the boreal forest, where human densities are comparatively low and the urban footprint is currently small."
0,"Achieving food security in a 'perfect storm' scenario is a grand challenge for society. Climate change and an expanding global population act in concert to make global food security even more complex and demanding. As achieving food security and the millennium development goal (MDG) to eradicate hunger influences the attainment of other MDGs, it is imperative that we offer solutions which are complementary and do not oppose one another. Sustainable intensification of agriculture has been proposed as a way to address hunger while also minimizing further environmental impact. However, the desire to raise productivity and yields has historically led to a degraded environment, reduced biodiversity and a reduction in ecosystem services (ES), with the greatest impacts affecting the poor. This paper proposes that the ES framework coupled with a policy response framework, for example Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR), can allow food security to be delivered alongside healthy ecosystems, which provide many other valuable services to humankind. Too often, agro-ecosystems have been considered as separate from other natural ecosystems and insufficient attention has been paid to the way in which services can flow to and from the agro-ecosystem to surrounding ecosystems. Highlighting recent research in a large multi-disciplinary project (ASSETS), we illustrate the ES approach to food security using a case study from the Zomba district of Malawi."
1,"In the trend of global warming and urbanization, frequent extreme weather influences the life of citizens seriously. Shanghai, as a typical rriega-city in China that has been successful in urbanization, suffers seriously from the urban heat island (UHI) effect. The research concentrates on the spatial and temporal pattern of surface UHI and land use. Then, the relation between them are further discussed. The results show that for the last 15 years, the UHI effect of Shanghai has been increasing continuously in both intensity and area. The UHI extends from the city center toward the suburban area. Along with the year, the ratio in area of Agricultural Land (AL), Wetland (WL), and Bare Land (BL) has decreased. On the contrary, Construction Land (CL) and Green Land (GL) have increased. The average land surface temperature (LST) rankings for each research year from high to low were all CL, BL, GL, AL, and WL. CL contributed the most to the UHI effect, while WL and GL contributed the most to mitigate the UHI. The conclusion provides practical advice aimed to mitigate the UHI effect for urban planning authorities."
1,"Evidence is mounting that climate-driven shifts in environmental conditions can elicit organismal evolution, yet there are sparingly few long-term records that document the tempo and progression of responses, particularly for plants capable of transforming ecosystems. In this study, we resurrected cohorts of a foundational coastal marsh sedge (Schoenoplectus americanus) from a time-stratified seed bank to reconstruct a century-long record of heritable variation in response to salinity exposure. Common-garden experiments revealed that S. americanus exhibits heritable variation in phenotypic traits and biomass-based measures of salinity tolerance. We found that responses to salinity exposure differed among the revived cohorts, with plants from the early 20th century exhibiting greater salinity tolerance than those from the mid to late 20th century. Fluctuations in salinity tolerance could reflect stochastic variation but a congruent record of genotypic variation points to the alternative possibility that the loss and gain in functionality are driven by selection, with comparisons to historical rainfall and paleosalinity records suggesting that selective pressures vary according to shifting estuarine conditions. Because salinity tolerance in S. americanus is tightly coupled to primary productivity and other vital ecosystem attributes, these findings indicate that organismal evolution merits further consideration as a factor shaping coastal marsh responses to climate change."
1,"The evidence for climate change is increasing, and global warming could lead to the extinction of some species. Here we estimated the extinction risk of six high-montane species of different taxonomic groups (fern, vascular plant, wood-inhabiting fungus, mollusk, saproxylic beetle, and bird) by modeling their occurrence under two global warming scenarios. We also assessed the cross-taxon indicator suitability of the selected species for monitoring climate change in low-mountain-range forests in southeastern Germany (Bavarian Forest National Park). We tested the influence of temperature and other habitat variables by applying semi-parametric spatial generalized linear models with binomial error. The probability of occurrence for each species under the present conditions and under two conditions of global warming was calculated. To assess the cross-taxon suitability, we tested the predictability of the final generalized linear models for each species using the measured occurrence of the other selected species and a discrimination technique. We identified temperature as the main driver for all selected high-montane species. Our statistical models predict a considerable risk of extinction of these species within the Bavarian Forest National Park as a result of global warming. Our discrimination model indicates that these species have essentially similar relationships with the environment and that five of the six species are suitable as indicators of early signs of global warming. The choice of which indicators to use should involve a consideration of the type of monitoring systems already in place. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
1,"Mangroves are an essential plant community in coastal ecosystems. While the importance of mangrove ecosystems is well acknowledged, climate change is expected to have a considerable negative impact on them, especially in terms of temperature, precipitation, sea level rise (SLR), ocean currents, and increasing storminess. Sri Lanka ranks near the bottom of the list of countries researching this problem, even though the scientific community's interest in examining the variation in mangrove health in response to climate change has gained significant attention. Consequently, this study illustrates how the leaf area index, a measure of mangrove health, fluctuates in response to varying precipitation, particularly during droughts in Sri Lanka's Kadolkele mangrove forest. The measurements of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were used to produce the leaf area index (LAI), which was then combined with the standard precipitation index (SPI) to estimate the health of the mangroves. The climate scenario, RCP8.5, was used to forecast future SPI (2021-2100), and LAI was modeled under the observed (1991-2019) and expected (2021-2100) drought events. The study reveals that the forecasted drought intensities modeled using the RCP8.5 scenario have no significant variations on LAI, even though some severe and extreme drought conditions exist. Nevertheless, the health of the mangrove ecosystem is predicted to deteriorate under drought conditions and rebound when drought intensity decreases. The extreme drought state (-2.05) was identified in 2064; therefore, LAI has showcased its lowest (0.04). LAI and SPI are projected to gradually increase from 2064 to 2100, while high fluctuations are observed from 2021 to 2064. Limited availability of LAI values with required details (measured date, time, and sample locations) and cloud-free Landsat images have affected the study results. This research presents a comprehensive understanding of Kadolkele mangrove forest under future droughts; thus, alarming relevant authorities to develop management plans to safeguard these critical ecosystems."
1,"Recent studies have found that terrestrial dryness indices like the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), and Aridity Index calculated from future climate model projections are mostly negative, implying a drying land surface with warming. Yet, the same models' future runoff and bulk soil moisture projections instead show regional signals of varying sign, and their vegetation projections show widespread greening, suggesting that the dryness indices could overstate climate change's direct impacts. Most modeling studies have attributed this gap to the indices' omission of CO2-driven stomatal closure. However, here we show that the index-impact gap is still wide even in future-like model experiments that switch off CO2 effects on plants. In these simulations, mean PDSI, Aridity Index, and SPEI still decline broadly with strong warming, while mean runoff, bulk soil moisture, and vegetation still respond more equivocally. This implies that CO2-plant effects are not the dominant or sole reason for the simulated index-impact gap. We discuss several alternative mechanisms that may explain it."
1,"BACKGROUND: Global climate change is anticipated to reduce future cereal yields and threaten food security, thus potentially increasing the risk of undernutrition. The causation of undernutrition is complex, and there is a need to develop models that better quantify the potential impacts of climate change on population health. OBJECTIVES: We developed a model for estimating future undernutrition that accounts for food and nonfood (socioeconomic) causes and can be linked to available regional scenario data. We estimated child stunting attributable to climate change in five regions in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) in 2050. METHODS: We used current national food availability and undernutrition data to parameterize and validate a global model, using a process-driven approach based on estimations of the physiological relationship between a lack of food and stunting. We estimated stunting in 2050 using published modeled national calorie availability under two climate scenarios and a reference scenario (no climate change). RESULTS: We estimated that climate change will lead to a relative increase in moderate stunting of 1-29% in 2050 compared with a future without climate change. Climate change will have a greater impact on rates of severe stunting, which we estimated will increase by 23% (central SSA) to 62% (South Asia). CONCLUSIONS: Climate change is likely to impair future efforts to reduce child malnutrition in South Asia and SSA, even when economic growth is taken into account. Our model suggests that to reduce and prevent future undernutrition, it is necessary to both increase food access and improve socioeconomic conditions, as well as reduce greenhouse gas emissions."
1,"At a time of rising urbanisation and climate change, urban green spaces (UGSs) are an essential element to help adapt to extreme weather events. Especially in urban core areas, heat and drought are regarded as human stress factors. The delineation of such areas constitutes an important reference geometry in topographic geodata (urban mask). This article deals with possibilities for investigating UGSs in European cities-based on unified urban masks-by applying city-wide metrics to Copernicus data (Urban Atlas including the Street Tree Layer). Both public and tree-covered urban green spaces are examined in detail. Selected results are presented for 30 European cities that display a wide range of urban structures. The spatial reference to uniformly delineated urban masks places the analytical focus of city-wide metrics onto corresponding core areas. In general, the values of UGS metrics vary considerably between cities, indicating the strong influence of city-specific factors on urban structures in Europe. For the comparative analysis of tree-covered urban areas, the Urban Green Raster Germany and a municipal tree register are used to provide additional data sources. The regular updating of the Copernicus dataset means that green spaces in European cities can be monitored, also using urban masks."
1,"There is benefit, risk and cost in all that we do, but when it comes to food, we expect that it will benefit our health, be available, safe to eat and affordable. But as climate change and demographic shifts through displacement and ageing gather momentum, the emphases on each of benefit, risk and cost will alter. That we are ecological beings whose health and wellbeing are ecosystem-dependent, must now be the underpinning framework for risk management. Loss of natural environment and biodiversity represents reduced nutritional and health resilience, which will need to be factored in to risk assessment and management with climate change. This is proving a problematic risk communication challenge. Previously desirable food and food pattern recommendations will be tempered by substantial sustainability, availability, safety, affordability, equity and ethical considerations. Future workforces will need to ensure basic livelihoods (food, water, shelter, clothing, healthcare, education, communication, essential transport, resource management and effective governance) and with risk minimisation Cost appraisal will have less to do with monetisation and more to do with resource management in accordance with equity and ethical principles. Communities could adopt Liveability Units (LU) for traceability and community-based transactions, as a currency for a more sustainable future, encouraging and enabling food and health system viability. Open source food and health systems, supported by LU matrix (bar code or QR) scanning with smartphones could be widely available for individual, household and community benefit, risk and cost management. The risk is remoteness from food's origins and megadata commercialisation."
1,"Current and projected increases in the concentrations of CO2 and other radiatively-active gases in the Earth's atmosphere lead to concern over possible impacts on agricultural pests, All pests would be affected by the global warming and consequent changes in precipitation, wind patterns, and frequencies of extreme weather events which may accompany the ''greenhouse effect.'' However, only weeds are likely to respond directly to the increasing CO2 concentration, Higher CO2 will stimulate photosynthesis and growth in C-3 weeds and reduce stomatal aperture and increase water use efficiency in both C-3 and C-4 weeds, Respiration, and photosynthate composition, concentration, and translocation may be affected, Perennial weeds may become more difficult to control, if increased photosynthesis stimulates greater production of rhizomes and other storage organs, Changes in leaf surface characteristics and excess starch accumulation in the leaves of C-3 weeds may interfere with herbicidal control, Global warming and other climatic changes will affect the growth, phenology, and geographical distribution of weeds, Aggressive species of tropical and subtropical origins, currently restricted to the southern U.S., may expand northward. Any direct or indirect consequences of the CO2 increase that differentially affect the growth or fitness of weeds and crops will alter weed-crop competitive interactions, sometimes to the detriment of the crop and sometimes to its benefit."
0,"To promote legal imports of timber and timber products, some countries, such as the United States, Australia, the Republic of Korea, and members of the European Union (EU), have adopted timber trade regulations. The implementation of these regulations is the result of the increase in illegal logging and its negative impact on the environment, biodiversity, and climate change. These regulations play an important role in international trade and are part of an effort to combat illegal logging and its consequences, such as deforestation. This study analyzes the impact of the implementation of these regulations on imports of timber and timber products from timber-producing and timber-processing countries with a significant share of illegal logging over the period 1995-2019. To do so, we use a method combining the gravity approach with a matching technique such as entropy balancing. To test the robustness of our results, we estimate alternative specifications and use alternative methods such as the gravity model and Ordinary Least Squares (OLS). We find that the implementation of these regulations has a negative effect on imports of timber and timber products. This reduction in imports is mainly more significant for timber and timber products such as pulp and wood furniture and can also vary according to the country implementing the regulation.."
1,"Climate change is widely regarded as one of the most serious global health threats of the 21st century. Its impacts will be disproportionately borne by the most disadvantaged populations, including indigenous peoples. For Maori in Aotearoa/New Zealand, as with other indigenous peoples worldwide, colonization has led to dispossession of land, destabilization of cultural foundations, and social, economic, and political marginalization. Climate change threatens to exacerbate these processes, adding future insult to historical and contemporary injury. Yet the challenges posed by climate change are accompanied by considerable opportunities to advance indigenous rights and reduce health disparities. In this paper, we examine issues related to climate change and Maori health using a right to health analytical framework, which identifies obligations for the New Zealand government."
1,"The effect of future climate scenarios on surface water and groundwater resources has been shown to have a consequent impact on water-dependent ecosystems. A regional-scale analysis of changes in water resources as a result of changing climate was undertaken in south-western Australia; a region with a large number of nationally and internationally recognised water-dependent ecosystems. The paper examines the potential environmental impacts of a substantial reduction in rainfall and an increase in temperature as projected by global climate models (GCMs) on river and groundwater-dependent terrestrial vegetation by 2030. Climate change effects on environmentally significant flow regimes were evaluated by applying the climate projections from 15 GCMs under three global warming 'scenarios to rainfall-runoff and groundwater models. It was estimated that under a dry future climate scenario, the frequency of river flow rates important for ecological communities is likely to be reduced by up to 2 months per year, which is likely to cause a significant level of stress to ecological communities. Additionally, the duration of no-flow periods may increase by more than 120 days in some streams. Under a dry future climate scenario, groundwater-dependent vegetation is projected to be at a high risk in over 19% of its current habitat area. Water-dependent ecosystems are also projected to be affected by an increase in groundwater abstraction. The results indicate that the projected impacts of future climate conditions are not likely to be uniform across the region but overall they could cause a continuing threat to water-dependent ecosystems. The implementation of water management plans should place particular emphasis on the ecological water requirements in 6 of the 13 river catchments in south-western Australia and in areas where groundwater abstraction is high. The climate projections and ecological impacts are a continuation of the trends that have taken place in the past three decades. Crown Copyright 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
1,"With the global food deficit increasing and rising climate change issues, there is a need to find green solutions to improve soil fertility and productivity while enhancing soil biochemical quality and reducing the ecological impact of agriculture. Biochar is a potentially cost-effective, carbonaceous resource with many agricultural and environmental applications. As a soil amendment, it improves soil physical and biochemical properties and increases soil fertility and productivity-particularly over the long-term-increasing soil aggregation, water retention, pH, and microbial activities, thus, improving overall soil quality, potentially helping to reduce chemical fertilizer needs over time. The extent of biochar's impact on soil physiochemical properties varies depending on biochar source, type, size, inherent soil characteristics, cropping system, etc. Moreover, biochar has significant potential in soil and water remediation, especially through its unique adsorption and chemical properties capable to capture and immobilize pollutants such as metal(loid)s, organic pollutants, and hazardous emerging contaminants such as microplastics. Further, biochar has also emerged as a key strategic, cost-effective material to tackle global issues such as climate change mitigation, reducing the net greenhouse gas emission to minimize global warming potential. However, a knowledge gap remains as to understanding the long-term persistence of biochar on agroecosystem, optimal biochar application rate for the diversity of biochar-soil-crop-environmental conditions, interaction of biochar with inherent soil carbon stock, specific mechanisms of biochar's effect on soil biotic properties, quantification of carbon sequestration, greenhouse gas emissions, synergy or potential antagonistic effects with other carbon sources such as compost, manure, residues, etc., its modification for environmental applications and associated environmental and human risks over long-term. Further research is needed to evaluate the long-term impacts of types and sizes of biochar on overall soil quality to recommend suitable application practices based on soil management and cropping system. Also, its environmental applications need to be finetuned for wider and target specific applications to tackle pressing environmental issues such as soil and water pollution."
1,"The Luquillo Experimental Forest (LEF) has a long history of research on tropical forestry, ecology, and conservation, dating as far back as the early 19th Century. Scientific surveys conducted by early explorers of Puerto Rico, followed by United States institutions contributed early understanding of biogeography, species endemism, and tropical soil characteristics. Research in the second half of the 1900s established the LEF as an exemplar of forest management and restoration research in the tropics. Research conducted as part of a radiation experiment funded by the Atomic Energy Commission in the 1960s on forest metabolism established the field of ecosystem ecology in the tropics. Subsequent research has built on these early advances to develop new theories on ecosystem response to disturbance regimes and the role of the biota in ecosystem resilience. Recent and current research in the LEF has advanced understanding of resilience to hurricane disturbances, human land use, gamma irradiation, landslides, drought, and warming, showing that even following the most severe disturbances (e.g., landslides, agriculture) forests reestablish within 60 years. Work in the LEF has reversed the paradigm that tropical ecosystems are fragile, but instead exhibit remarkable resilience to many forms of disturbance present at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Current research is already advancing understanding of how climate change and attendant effects on the disturbance regime might affect the composition, structure, and function of tropical forest ecosystems."
1,"Changing climatic conditions threaten forest ecosystems. Drought, disease and infestation, are leading to forest die-offs which cause substantial economic and ecological losses. In central Europe, this is especially relevant for commercially important coniferous tree species. This study uses climate envelope exceedance (CEE) to approximate species risk under different future climate scenarios. To achieve this, we used current species presence-absence and historical climate data, coupled with future climate scenarios from various Earth System Models. Climate scenarios tended towards drier and warmer conditions, causing strong CEEs especially for spruce. However, we show that annual averages of temperature and precipitation obscure climate extremes. Including climate extremes reveals a broader increase in CEEs across all tree species. Our study shows that the consideration of climate extremes, which cannot be adequately reflected in annual averages, leads to a different assessment of the risk of forests and thus the options for adapting to climate change."
